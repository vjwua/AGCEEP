EVENTNAME336110;The Imperial capital;x
EVENTHIST336110;Now that we have established the much-needed reforms in the Empire, we can proceed to the creation of some more central institutions that would facilitate the administration of the Kingdom of Germany. Before doing that, we must yet decide where to place these institutions, i.e. which city should be the capital of Germany. Nürnberg, whose Imperial castle was the main residence of the emperors in the late middle ages, already hosts the Imperial Executive Council and would be an obvious choice. By instead making Frankfurt, site of the Imperial elections, the centre of the Empire, we would stress the sole legitimation of Imperial power by election. On the other hand, chosing Aachen, the capital of Charlemagne and the city of Imperial coronations, would accentuate both the divine legitimacy of Imperial rule and the ancient Frankish legacy. Of course, we could as well just make the hereditary residence of the Emperor capital of Germany.;x

EVENTHIST366100;Through astute negotiations and a bit of force, we have managed to convince all four Rhenish electors - the Count Palatine and the archbishops of Mainz, Trier and Cologne - to give up their special privileges granted in the Golden Bull, the regalia, which allows us to create an Electoral Rhenish Imperial Circle covering their territory and to implement reforms establishing Imperial authority there as has been done in most of Germany. Within this circle, the four electors would still retain significant privileges. Therefore it might also be worth contemplation to ignore Imperial law in this case and make the Electoral Rhenish territories direct Imperial possessions.

Within this circle, the two electors will still retain some privileges, which is however a price that we have to pay for being able to integrate such a large area.;x

#;x
EVENTHIST366300;After the humiliating defeat against Napoléon's armies and the harsh terms that followed in the peace, the need for drastic measures for the Empire to regain its former military and economical strength was obvious. A wide range of reforms implemented led to the abolishment of serfdom, privileges being revoked and an efficient decentralized government as well as compulsory military service. However this was not a sure thing as different segments of society wanted different types of reforms. It could have been quite differently.;x
#;x
EVENTHIST366303;Wenzel-Anton, Earl and then Prince of Rittberg-Kaunitz (1711-1794) is a noble from Bohemia. Impregnated of the culture of the Englightenment, a devoted civil servant, he always had the full confidence and support from the Emperor. After a diplomatic career, he became Imperial Chancellor in 1753, till 1792.;x
#;x
EVENTHIST366304;Joseph II, 1741-90, Holy Roman Emperor (1765-90). After his fathers death 1765, Joseph acted as emperor and co-regent with his mother but had little real influence. Resenting this fact, he takes to traveling until his mothers death in 1780. He then begins reformations largely based on his own philosophy and principles, rather than those originating in the Enlightenment. These reforms consisted of nothing less than the abolition of hereditary and ecclesiastic privileges as well as the creation of a civil service based on merit and loyalty rather than birth.;x
#;x
EVENTHIST366305;Metternich began his state career in 1797 as representative of the Westphalian College of counts at the Congress of Rastatt, but in less than a decade, he had managed to become ambassador of the Empire in France. His career primed in 1809 when he was assigned the post as minister of Imperial foreign affairs. Until 1813 Metternich will pursue a policy of acquiescence to French supremacy. A policy which ends with the creation of the Quadruple Alliance, the war against France, and the allied victory the very same year. The following 35 years have been called the Age of Metternich for during this time he was the chief arbiter of Europe. The Metternich system depended upon political and religious censorship, espionage, and the suppression of revolutionary and nationalist movements. This system holds part of the blame for the revolutions of 1848.;x
#;x
EVENTHIST366306;Joseph II was a controversial ruler. He began his reign with liberal reforms like the Edict of Toleration, which gave Lutherans, Calvinists, and Orthodox near equality with Roman Catholics. He also abolished serfdom and (temporarily) eased up on official censorship. However, Joseph was also an extreme centralist. In March 1787 Joseph swept away the constitution of the Empire and announced that from then on it would be ruled according to absolutist principles. Resistance simmered in the Netherlands until 1789 when it boiled over into open revolt and for a time it appeared as if revolution might erupt in many parts of the monarchy.;x
#;x
EVENTHIST366307;The Habsburg ruler reserved two places for Hungarians in the Hofrat which he was organizing as his central advisory council for his dominions as a whole - it was they themselves who failed to take up the offer.;x
#;x
EVENTHIST366321;After the end of the reign of Louis XIV in France and the following wars of the Spanish succession, the age of enlightenment slowly began to spread all over Europe by the words of writers and philosophers of the time such as Locke, Rosseau, Diderot, Hume, Leibniz and Montesquieu. The New Ideals was religious freedom, education and freedom of speech and political opinion. The monumental work that captured the essence of the enlightenment was Diderot's Encyclopédie, taking 25 years for it's completion and in the end totaling a collection of no less then 35 volumes of 1000 pages each describing everything from how to knit a sock to methods of improving the manufacturing of artillery pieces. Of the monarchs of Europe none was a stronger believer of these ideas than the Holy Roman Emperor, Friedrich VIII also know as Frederick the Great.;x
#;x
EVENTHIST366322;Emperor Frederick VII William endowed the Holy Roman Empire with its military and bureaucratic character. He was fanatically addicted to work and a firm autocrat. Frederick William reorganized the administrative system, raised the army to XXXX men (equivalent to 4 percent of the population) and geared the whole organization of the state to the military machine. The Empire thus became a militaristic and absolutist state.;x
#;x
EVENTNAME366800;Albrecht's decision;x
EVENTHIST366800;Duke Frederick of Saxony, Grandmaster of the Teutonic Order died in December 1510. Albrecht von Hohenzollern was chosen as his successor early in 1511 in the hope that his relationship to his maternal uncle, Sigismund I the Old, King of Poland, would facilitate a settlement of the disputes over eastern Prussia, wich had been held by the Order under Polish suzerainty since the Second Peace of Torun in 1466. The new Grand Master, aware of his duties to the empire and to the papacy, refused to submit to the crown of Poland and instead swore allegiance to the Holy Roman Empire. As war over the Order's existence appeared inevitable, Albert made strenuous efforts to secure allies and carried on protracted negotiations with the Emperor.;x

EVENTNAME366807;The peace of Königsberg;x
EVENTHIST366807;With Poland decisively beaten by the Teutonic Order it was forced to sign the treaty of Königsberg between the Holy Roman Empire, the Teutonic Order and Poland. By the terms of this treaty Poland was forced to renounce all its claims on Silesia and Neumark as well as restoring Western Prussia to the Teutonic Order. Though the Order had won the war against Poland its economy was in ruins and its dependency on the Empire greater than ever.;x

EVENTHIST142999;At the death of Enrique IV the impotent, Castile was split between supporters of Juana, daughter of the King's wife, Isabel of Portugal, and those of Isabel Trastamara, daughter of the second marriage of Juan II. Alfonso of Portugal saw a chance of becoming King of Castile and married his niece Juana, immediately sending his armies to invade Castile in support of Juana's side. Isabel answered by claiming the crown of Portugal. After all, as Queen of Castile she was the legitimate heir of the old Visigothic Kings, and thus of their Hispanic Kingdom. The union of Castile and Portugal had supporters in both Kingdoms, and if Isabel and Fernando were capable of gaining control of all of peninsular Portugal, Isabel could become Queen of Portugal also.;x

EVENTHIST191991;Manco Inca was killed by two Portuguese deserters who had decided to change sides again and return with the honor of having killed him. The fight still continued until the last of his successors, Tupac Amaru, lost his capital Vilcabamba (Manu) and was captured and executed in 1572. With his death the resistance became ineffective and the Inca Empire was completely absorbed by Portugal.;x

EVENTHIST191992;After recapturing Lima, the question was raised about what to do with the Portuguese foreigners who remained in Lima. Resentment of the Portuguese, and their atrocities against our people, makes simply killing them off a popular choice.

EVENTHIST191993;The new Emperor, Manco Inca, was in fact a prisoner in his own palace, humiliated by the Portuguese. As the atrocities against his people became known to Manco Inca, he began to develop a hatred for them. Hernando Pizarro eventually restored Manco Inca's freedom and dignity, but it was too late. Villac Umu counseled Manco Inca to send out secret orders to gather weapons and plant a lot of crops in preparation for war with the Portuguese. He made his move around Easter 1536. Having won the trust of Hernando, he was granted permission to attend a ceremony northwest of Cuzco, instead he and Villac Umu convened a war council in the mountains. Ultimately, however, hatred of the Incas among the natives was stronger than that of the Portuguese and many natives rallied to the Portuguese cause. But during this period, the Portuguese were very nearly driven into the sea...;x

EVENTHIST260867;In 1585 and early 1586, Sir Francis Drake, operating with letters of marque from Elizabeth, conducted a series of operations that electrified England and infuriated Portugal. He raided Vigo, the Canaries, and the Cape Verde Islands, then crossed the Atlantic and attacked Hispaniola and Cartagena. He returned to England with a vast amount of plunder.;x
#;x
EVENTHIST260868;In 1577, Sir Francis Drake was commissioned to sail to the western coast of the Americas to seek treasure and spices. After passing the Strait of Magellan, he caught the Portuguese completely by surprise. For months, Drake sailed up and down the Pacific coast of the Americas, sacking towns like Lima and Valparaiso, and seizing the galleon 'Cacafuego', with its large cargo of treasure. Drake then crossed the Pacific and returned home to England.;x

EVENTHIST260869;In 1572 and 1573, Sir Francis Drake and a small group of Englishmen, assisted by escaped slaves known as Cimaroons, raided along the Mexican coast and, in a stunning coup, captured a large mule train laden with gold and silver inbound to Nombre de Dios, gaining an incredible amount of treasure.;x

EVENTHIST260895;Even the combined resources of Portugal and Castile weren't up to the task of colonizing two entire continents plus innumerable islands round the world. The population in Iberia declined steeply during the 17th Century as people left to seek their fortunes abroad or died of the plagues that repeatedly swept the Peninsula during that time.;x
#;x
EVENTHIST260896;The Portuguese just did not have the money to pursue North African conquests, but the rebellion of the Moriscos in 1569, at a time when Tunis was conquered by the Ottomans by the famous pirate and Beylerbey of Algiers, Uluj Ali, made them painfully aware of the dangers of ignoring that front. With great effort, the Moriscos rebellion was put down and the Ottoman fleet defeated at Lepanto. But although Tunis was briefly recovered, it was quickly lost again due to lack of resources. But they was not alone in having problems. The Ottomans, defeated at Malta and Lepanto, found themselves also overstretched due to the demand of their conflicts with Persia. Under these circumstances, the Portuguese and Murad III negotiated a series of truces between 1577 and 1581. In these truces they renounced the former Portuguese conquests in North Africa, while the Ottoman sultan renounced Oran and would not lend help to the Moriscos. The peace between Portugal and the Ottoman Empire would be permanent, and would allow both empires to abandon the Mediterranean, which was left in the hands of the Barbary pirates, periodically checked by the European navies.;x
#;x
EVENTHIST260899;In 1565 the help of the Portuguese was required by the Hospitallers to defend Malta against a combined assault by the Ottomans and Barbary pirates. The victory was very important because it put a clear limit to how far could the Ottoman Empire project its power. However the Ottoman Empire was at its peak, as the capture of Tunis in 1569 demonstrated. The capture of Cyprus in 1571, triggered the formation of a Holy League, mainly formed by Portugal, Venice and Papal States, with the combined fleet under command of Don Juan de Austria. The interests of Venice and Portugal were very different: Venice wanted to recover Cyprus, and Portugal wanted to recover her North African presidios, and they could only agree in fighting the Ottoman Navy. The ensuing battle at Lepanto was the biggest naval battle in modern times with over 32,000 casualties (by comparison Trafalgar had only 3,000), 25,000 of them on the Ottoman side which was almost completely destroyed. News of the victory were extremely well received by the Christians that had suffered from Ottoman and Barbary piracy. Although the Ottomans rebuilt their fleet and recaptured Tunis a second time in 1574, their naval supremacy in the Mediterranean was destroyed forever.;x
#;x
EVENTHIST260900;The Knights Hospitallers took care of the defense of Tripoli after its cession by Portugal for over 20 years. Provisioned by the Viceroy of Sicily and with the help of a Portuguese garrison, the Order even considered moving their see there. However in 1551 they were attacked by a huge Ottoman army under command of Sinan Pasha and Dragut. There were very few Knights in Tripoli, and the Portuguese soldiers from Calabria refused to fight, and so Tripoli was surrendered almost without fight. In 1560 the Grand Master Jean Parisot de la Valette enticed the Viceroy of Sicily, Juan de la Cerda, Duke of Medinaceli to attempt its recovery, but the expedition was a complete failure, since Tripoli had been converted into a stronghold by huge Ottoman defensive works under the direction of Dragut.;x
#;x
EVENTHIST260901;The fall of Tlemcen into Ottoman hands in 1551 put Portuguese Oran in a mortal danger. Martín Alonso de Cordoba, Conde de Alcaudete, military governor of Oran, entered into an alliance with the Sultan of Morocco, Muhammad al-Shaykh, to drive the Turks from Tlemcen. However the Ottoman Sultan Suleiman dispatched spies that assassinated Muhammad al-Shaykh in 1557. Having lost this ally for an attack on Algiers, Alcaudete marched with an army of 12,000 on Mustaghanim (Mostaganem) the next year. But tribes and the Turkish forces of Hasan Quru totalling over 70,000 men defeated them. Alcaudete was killed, and his son and most of the army were captured. The next year many of them would abjure from their beliefs to escape slavery. Tlemcen disappeared as a country, firmly in the hands of the Pashas of Al-Djazaúr who were named by the Ottoman Empire. Tripoli was lost in 1551, Bugia in 1555, and Tunis in 1570. Portugal had lost the North African game, but would successfully defend Oran and Melilla from recurrent attacks for centuries.;x
#;x
EVENTHIST260902;Taking advantage of the fights between different tribes in Tlemcen, the Conde de Alcaudete, military governor of Portuguese Oran, supported the Banu Rashid to dethrone Muhammad and install his brother Ahmad in 1545. Muhammad sought the help of Hassan Pasha, ruler of Al-Djazaúr and son of Khayr ad-Din Barbarossa, and was restored with the help of the Turks. Alcaudete attacked in 1547, but was driven back by the Turks. Meanwhile, in Morocco, the pro-Turkish Wattasid Sultan Ahmad was defeated by the Sa'did Muhammad al-Shaykh (al-Mahdi), who then invaded Tlemcen putting an end to 300 years of Zayyanid rule there. The Turkish reaction under Agha Hasan Quru however drove them out. Tlemcen was under Turkish control, but disputed by Moroccans and the Portuguese.;x
#;x
EVENTHIST260904;The alliance against the Portuguese, signed by the Most Christian King François Ier of France and the Sultan Suleiman of the Ottoman Empire, resulted in attacks by the Turks every time France fought against Aragon. The most destructive raid was the one produced after the invasion of Milan by France in 1542. Barbarossa, on command of a huge Ottoman and Barbary fleet, raided the coasts of Italy, joining later a French fleet under command of the Duke of Enghien at Marseilles and both proceeded to attack Nice. At the arrival of Andrea Doria and Alfonso de Avalos, they retreated to Toulon for winter, where the churches were prohibited from ringing their bells, and Christian slaves were openly sold between Turks and pirates. While at Toulon, a fleet was dispatched to sack the coasts of Portugal. After the peace of Crépy between France and Portugal, Barbarossa returned to Istanbul, pillaging the coasts of Tuscany and Naples in the way.;x
#;x
EVENTHIST260906;The confrontation between Portugal and the Sultan of the Ottomans reached Tlemcen at a delicate point, when dynastic fights were shaking the Zayyanids. The Conde de Alcaudete, military governor of Oran, joined in 1535 with tribal chief Ibn Radwan to help Zayyanid prince Abdallah overthrow his older brother Muhammad V. The expedition, including 600 Portuguese soldiers, was almost completely wiped out by the Banu Rashid tribe. However, probably because the Portuguese had taken Tunis, Sultan Muhammad agreed to pay tribute to Oran in exchange for Portuguese protection. Six years later, the expedition of more than four hundred ships sent against Barbarossa in Algiers departed too late in the season and, surprised by a storm, lost one fourth of its effectives and had to retreat. Overstretched because of the wars against France the Portuguese did not have the resources to maintain their hegemony in the Western Mediterranean against the Ottomans.;x
#;x
EVENTNAME260907;Portuguese Hegemony in North Africa;x
EVENTHIST260907;After the pact between François Ier of France and the Ottoman Sultan in 1527, the Portuguese found their empire in a difficult situation. The Turks usally sent their fleets to ravage their coasts, coinciding and even coordinating with French attacks. To avoid complete Ottoman control of the Mediterranean, they took Tunis in 1535. The new Governor of Oran, Martín Alonso de Cordoba, the Conde de Alcaudete, was ordered to lead an expedition against Tlemcen which was shifting towards the Ottoman side. At Prevesa, in the Albanian coast, the combined fleets of Portugal, Venice, Genoa and Papal States, under command of Andrea Doria, were defeated by the Ottoman-Barbary fleet under Khayr ad-Din Barbarossa. Although losses were small and mostly Venetian, since Doria refused to fight, its effect was to give supremacy in the Eastern Mediterranean to the Ottomans. Besides the expedition of Alcaudete, something needed to be done to maintain Portuguese supremacy, at least in the Western Mediterranean, and so a naval expedition against Al-Djazaúr (Algiers) was prepared.;x
#;x
EVENTNAME260908;Tunis Under Portuguese Control;x
EVENTHIST260908;After the conquest of Tunis in 1535, the Portuguese reinstated al-Hassa Ibn Muhammad as Pasha of Tunis. A garrison of Portuguese soldiers was left to help him keep control and ensure his loyalty. Tunis continued as a vassal of Portugal until 1574, when it was conquered by the Ottoman Empire.;x
#;x
EVENTHIST260911;The Portuguese had inherited a North African situation that was turning into a nightmare. The Ottomans were calling to the doors of Vienna, and in Africa they had taken over Egypt, and with the help of the Barbary pirates, they were taking over Kingdom after Kingdom, destroying the policy of alliances that the King's grandfather Fernando had established. He could not let them reach the Straits of Gibraltar. Worse still, they entered an alliance with France, so he was facing war simultaneously in all fronts. To add to that, the Portuguese presidios (fortresses) in Africa were very difficult to defend. When Barbarossa conquered Tunis in 1534, the fleeing Pasha al-Hassan went to the Portuguese court and asked for help in exchange for vassalage. The King could not let the Ottomans or their allies come any closer to Portugal and Italy. A huge armada was assembled and he decided to lead it in person.;x
#;x
EVENTHIST260912;Portugal was the first nation in the world to create a permanent specific naval infantry unit in 1537. This was the Old Company of the Sea of Naples composed by harquebusiers to fight on board galleys. In the winter of 1564 spies told of a powerful Ottoman fleet being readied in Constantinople. On May 18, 1565 their target was revealed when the Janissaries landed in Malta. From the beginning of May Aragon had been gathering her force. Finally, on August 25, the Viceroy of Sicily, García de Toledo, gave the order to depart, arriving at Malta on September 7, forcing the Ottomans to lift their siege on the exact same day they had scheduled their final full-out assault on the few surviving defenders. Had they arrived one day later, Malta would have been lost. It was clear that a reaction time of four months was not acceptable and that Portugal could not project her power far away unless a permanent force capable of landing and conducting battles that could be quickly deployed was assigned to the Navy. So in February 1566 the Tercio de la Armada del Mar Oceano, or Tercio of the Navy of the Ocean Sea, also known as Tercio de Figueroa for its first commander, was created with 6,700 soldiers. Harquebusiers from this unit were the first to assault the Sultana, the Ottoman flagship in the battle of Lepanto and, as a reward, its commander Lope de Figueroa was given the commission to inform the King of the victory.;x

EVENTHIST260915;Both Manuel I and his wife Maria were great-grandchildren of Ferdinand I of Aragon. While Maria was the only third daughter of Isabel and Fernando they felt that they could use their Aragonese blood to legitimate their desire to unite all of Iberia under their sway. Maria's older sister, Juana, commonly called La Loca (The Crazy), wasn't fit to rule, but her child Enric was and had been taught by his grandfather Fernando. When Fernando died on 23 January 1516 the Portuguese rulers made their bid for the throne. They sent emissaries to many Aragonese and Catalan nobles and city councils to persuade them to their side. They emphasized that Enric was young, untried and liable to be easily manipulated by the enemies of whoever they were talking to. They promised to respect the ancient privileges and rights of those who aided them, but made no promises what so ever about those who fought against them. Many preferred Enric, a native-born Catalan, and precisely because they thought they could easily manipulate him, but the sheer power of Portugal and Castile persuaded many to try and sit on the fence.;x

EVENTHIST260917;Plans had been made to expell the Morisques from Portugal only a decade after the Alpujarras Revolt was crushed, but the wars against the Dutch and English prevented the Portuguese from massing the necessary troops and ships. It took some time to gather the necessary resources, but they began once peace was declared. The order fell hardest on Aragon, Valencia and Murcia because they had large numbers of unassimilated Morisques from the earlier stages of the Reconquista. Valencia lost almost a third of its population and Aragon almost a fifth. But Kings of Portugal and their advisors thought this was a cheap price to pay for cleansing POrtugal of its hated minority and to reassert the power and prestige of the Crown, both badly damaged by its defeats by the Protestant heretics.;x

EVENTHIST260933;Manco Inca was killed by two Portuguese deserters, who had decided to change sides again and return with the honor of having killed him. The fight still continued until the last of his successors, Tupac Amaru, lost his capital Vilcabamba (Manu) and was captured and executed in 1572. With his death, the resistance became ineffective, and the Incan Empire was completely absorbed by Portugal.;x
#;x
EVENTHIST260935;The new Emperor Manco Inca, was in fact a prisoner in his own palace, humiliated by the Portuguese. As the atrocities against his people became known to Manco Inca, he began to develop a hatred for his captors. Hernando Pizarro finally restored Manco Inca's freedom and dignity, but it was too late. Villac Umu counseled Manco Inca to send out secret orders to gather weapons and large crop plantings in preparation for war with the Portuguese. He made his move around Easter 1536. Having won the trust of Hernando, he was granted permission to attend a ceremony northwest of Cuzco, instead he and Villac Umu convened a war council in the mountains. When Manco Inca did not return, Hernando Pizarro realized the mistake he made by letting him go and an Inca counterattack seemed imminent. Soon an army numbering in the tens of thousands was besieging the Portuguese-held city of Cuzco, and another Inca army was sighted heading towards the Portuguese stronghold of Lima. Manco's warriors annihilated every relief column sent from Lima to Cuzco. An alarmed Francisco Pizarro sent frantic letters to every Portuguese possession in the New World asking for reinforcements, and hoping that he could hold back the Inca armies until help arrived...;x
#;x
EVENTHIST260938;Pizarro had become a prisoner of his prisoner. Releasing him was out of the question, as he would immediately order the attack by massive armies, and keeping him was becoming more and more dangerous. Atahuallpa had ordered the execution of his brother from his prison, and the Portuguese feared that he could sooner or later order an attack despite the risk to his life. Two sides were split in Pizarro's band of men: while most wanted to kill Atahuallpa, some saw it as dishonorable and unlawful, as Atahuallpa had complied with all their requests. Finally Pizarro took the decision and a mock trial was set up. Atahuallpa was accused of repeatedly rejecting conversion, an incestuous relationship with his sister and killing his brother, all of them true, and sentenced to death. Since he was going to burn at the stake he accepted conversion to avoid a death that would prevent his eternal life, as the one he had given his brother. He was therefore strangled. The King of Portugal was highly displeased with the killing of a fellow monarch but it was too late to do anything about it. The decision, however, proved to be strategically correct, as without its Emperor the Inca Empire collapsed into the hands of the Portuguese.;x

EVENTNAME260941;Pizarro claims Peru for Portugal;x
EVENTHIST260941;Having found the Inca empire, Francisco Pizarro had to guarantee his right to conquer it, as he was opposed by the new governor of Panama. He agreed with Diego de Almagro to divide the rights and titles equally, and travelled to the court with the royal fifth of all the riches they had already found. Impressed with the gold, the King granted the right of conquest of Peru to him. But Pizarro did not keep his word to Almagro and kept all the important titles and rights for himself. Accompanied by his brothers Gonzalo, Juan and Hernando he returned to Panama.;x

EVENTNAME260943;The New Laws;x
EVENTHIST260943;Fray Bartolome de las Casas was not alone in his defense of Indian rights. Many other priests and some officials in the colonies denounced the abuses and atrocities. The King and his court were displeased in the bloody way that the conquest of New Spain (the Incas) had been conducted by Pizarro and decided to regulate the treatment and rights of the Indians through legislation, according to the advice of Las Casas. The New Laws enacted in 1542 forbade any kind of slavery and forced labor, allowed ownership of land by the Indians, and stated that the Church had no authority over non-Christian natives. They also forbade the establishment of new encomiendas and reduced the size of existing ones. The New Laws caused quite a stir in the colonies and it was predicted that they would bring ruin to the colonists.;x

EVENTHIST260984;With the conquest of Granada, its inhabitants became Mudejars, Muslim subjects of the Crown. By the terms of the peace agreement they were permitted to retain their freedom of worship and their new rulers were permitted to attempt to peaceably convert them. When the King returned to Granada in 1499, he could see that the conversion program was going nowhere, and authorized Cisneros to take charge. He started by confiscating Muslim books and promoting the semi-forced conversion of a subgroup of Muslims, the Helches, descendants of Christians that had been Islamized for generations. By Christmas 1499, the Muslims rebelled in the city and the rebellion quickly spread throughout the province.;x
#;x
EVENTHIST260985;On the recommendation of the powerful Cardinal Mendoza, Franciscan Friar Cisneros was appointed as confessor to King João II after the conquest of Granada. He soon obtained all his confidence, and in 1495, he was appointed bishop of Toledo at the death of Mendoza. The post included a chancellorship of Castile, that he only accepted under orders of the Pope. He soon became one of the most influential men in the Kingdom, with the capacity to influence royal policies. The King had promised the Muslims of Granada that they could keep their religion and opted for a slow conversion process that could take generations. Cisneros had his own ideas about that.;x

EVENTHIST260986;Coming out of the civil war, and seeing that the Canary Islands could not be conquered by the Peraza, Afonso V ordered an expedition in 1478.

To avoid legal problems, the King bought back the rights to Gran Canaria, La Palma and Tenerife, while the remaining islands continued under feudal status for the Peraza family. In 1580 the King sent Pedro de Vera to conquer the islands, who using all available means, including war dogs, conquered Gran Canaria by 1483.;x

EVENTHIST260994;Antonio Pigafetta belonged to a rich family of Vicenza. In his youth he studied astronomy, geography and cartography. He served on board the galleys of the order of St. John at the beginning of 16th century. In 1519 he accompanied the Papal Nuncio, Monsignor Chieregati, to Portual where he was presented to the Kings. There he heard of the trip of Magellan, and negotiated to be admitted as a paying passenger, a supernumerary. In spite of initial difficulties with Magellan, he managed to gain his confidence and served as a chronicler and cartographer for him. During the trip, Pigafetta collected information about geography, the climate, the flora, the fauna and the inhabitants of the visited places. His meticulous notes were to serve as invaluable documents to future explorers and cartographers, mainly due to their focus on nautical and linguistic data. In the battle at Mactan, Philippines, in which Magellan was killed, Pigafetta also was hurt. Nevertheless, he managed to recover and was among the 18 on board the Victoria who accompanied Juan Sebastián Elcano in his return to Spain. After reaching port in Sanlúcar de Barrameda (Cadiz) in September of 1522, three years after his departure, he recollected his experiences in 'Relations of the First Round-the-world Trip', composed in Italian and published in Venice. After that voyage Pigafetta returned to Italy where he died in his native city in 1534.;x

EVENTHIST260999;At the death of Enrique IV the impotent, Castile was split between supporters of Juana, daughter of the King's wife, Isabel of Portugal, and those of Isabel Trastamara, daughter of the second marriage of Juan II. Alfonso V of Portugal saw a chance of becoming King of Castile and married his niece Juana, immediately sending his armies to invade Castile in support of Juana's side. The Castilian civil war lasted for four years and ended with the Treaty of Alcacovas of 1479 after the complete victory of Isabel. But if Alfonso and his son Joao had been able to gain control of all of peninsular Castile, Juana would have become Queen of Castile, and probably Joao would have married Juana after the annulment of Alfonso's marriage by the Pope, becoming King of Portugal and Castile.;x

EVENTHIST285997;The Castilians had long been jealous of the profits that the Portuguese had extracted from West Africa and were determined to take advantage themselves as soon as they could. In 1481 Isabel and Fernando held a meeting with their council to decide whether or not to build a fort on the Mina coast to secure the trade of gold in this region.;x

EVENTNAME332999;Between the Portuguese and the Ottomans;x
EVENTHIST332999;The confrontation between the Portuguese and the Sultan of the Ottomans reached Tlemcen at a delicate point, when dynastic fights were shaking the Zayyanids. The Conde de Alcaudete, military governor of Oran, joined in 1535 with tribal chief Ibn Radwan to help Zayyanid prince Abdallah overthrow his older brother Muhammad V. The expedition, including 600 Portuguese soldiers, was almost completely wiped out by the Banu Rashid tribe. However, probably because the Portuguese had taken Tunis, Sultan Muhammad agreed to pay tribute to Oran in exchange for Portuguese protection. The Zayyanid dynasty, weakened by the emergence of Al-Djazaúr, and the loss of Oran, and neighbour to a strong Morocco, was too weak to survive alone.;x

#;x
EVENTHIST193011;Vincenzo Gonzaga kills Chrichton, a Scotsman, who served as a counselor of his father's. His father Guglielmo is outraged. Vincenzo apologized to his father, and submitted to a hearing. Rumor has it that he was exonerated because his sword was shorter than Chrichton's, so he couldn't have been responsible. On the other hand, this is also a reference to Vincenzo's fruitless marriage.;x
#;x
EVENTHIST193012;The marriage of Vincenzo Gonzaga and Elizabeth Farnese has not been consummated. Her relatives claim that Vincenzo is impotent, the Italian court maintains that it is her fault. An alternate marriage with a Tuscan princess has been established, however, the Tuscan court insists that Vincenzo proves his potency. They have arranged a test in which he will have to perform with an orphan girl in the presence of eight women and a set of guards, priests and agents.;x

EVENTHIST193016;Frederico il Gobbo (the humpback) and his son were nearly poisoned by his brothers Rodolfo and Gian Francesco. The plot was betrayed by another brother, Ludovico, but caused concerns at court. Unusally for a Renaissance Prince, Frederico was inclined to be merciful. The incident was likely the origin of Shakespeare's 'Murder of Gonzaga'.;x
#;x
EVENTHIST193017;Isabella d'Este married Franceso Gonzaga in 1490. As a princess of Ferrara she recieved an extensive education, and has been called the 'First Lady of the Renaissance'.

EVENTNAME193026;Civil Wars;x
EVENTHIST193026;The regency of Charles Emmanuel II was in the hands of his mother. Despite her French origins she resisted French attempts to determine policy for Kingdom of Italy. However, her brothers-in-law sought the help of Spain to oust her from the regency and she was forced to accept French aid in the civil wars that followed.;x

EVENTHIST193030;After the War of Spanish Succession Vittorio Amedeo II overhauled the administration of the Italian state along absolutist lines. He centralized power, reduced the independence of the judiciary, established a diplomatic network of embassies in major capitals, created a navy and a militia and placed the states finances on a more solid basis. These reforms laid the foundation from which the further expansion of Italy in the eighteenth century.;x
#;x
EVENTHIST193031;Upon his ascension Carlo Emanuele III oversaw the finalization of a land register enumerating all the property in the state. This survey was the first of its kind in Europe. It ended manorial and clerical privileges, and allowed Charles Emmanuel to build a very effective bureaucracy to administer his father's reforms. Kingdom of Italy was the model of the 'well-administered state', and tax revenues soared. During his reign Italy had the most effective army it would have until the mid-19th century, winning notable successes in the Polish War of Succession and the Austrian War of Succession.;x

EVENTNAME193033;The Mine in Volterra;x
EVENTHIST193033;In 1472 a contract was granted to a consortium to mine alum from a cave near the Tuscan town of Volterra. There were strong indications that the grant of the contract may have been corrupt and magistrates from the town seized the mine. The King was asked to mediate and ruled in favor of the consortium who immediately seized the mine causing violent rioting in Volterra and the murder of some of the members of the consortium. Many influential members of the Court argued that the Volterrans should be offered lenient terms to defuse the crisis. However, the King's credibility was on the line, and he felt that they should be taught a lesson. He hired mercenaries and after a siege of a month the town was plundered in violation of the terms of surrender. This event is still memorialized in Volterra.

EVENTNAME193034;The Rise of Savonarola;x
EVENTHIST193034;Girolamo Savonarola was a Dominican monk, who rose to power in Florence's city council driving out the despised de' Medici's governor and led the city into an age of enforced piety. He oversaw burnings of luxuries, scourging of the wicked and violent denuciations of the excesses of themerchant classes. In 1497, during the carnival, rather than the traditional games and costume parades Savonarola oversaw the famous 'bonfire of the vanities', where numerous paintings, books and clothes that were considered lewd were burned.;x

EVENTNAME193036;The Knights of Santo Stefano;x
EVENTHIST193036;Inspired by the successes of the Knights of St. John in fighting the Turks, the King set up the order of the Knights of Santo Stefano. Based out of Pisa their role was to serve him when he needed naval support and to defend Italian interests in the Mediterranean. They played a role in many of the great conflicts in the Mediterranean against the Ottomans including the battle of Lepanto (1572) and the siege of Candia (1645-1669). When not at war they engaged in piracy against Turkish and occasionally Venetian shipping.;x

EVENTNAME193037;Galileo Galilei: the modern science is born;x
EVENTHIST193037;Galileo was born in Pisa in Tuscany and he is chiefly remembered for his work on free fall, his use of the telescope and his employment of experimentation. Early in his career he determined that repetition time of a pendulum was the same regardless of the amplitude of the oscillation. He determined experimentally that objects do not fall with velocities proportionate to their weight that was a direct contradiction of the teachings of Aristotle. In 1609 he built a telescope and began detailed observations of the sky. However his disagreements with the Aristotelean canon made his life at the University of Padua increasingly difficult as he met accusations from the Church and the opposition of detractors at the University. In 1610 the King invited him to come to the capital and continue his work away from his opponents.;x

#;x
EVENTNAME193038;Galileo Galilei publishes the 'Dialogues';x
EVENTHIST193038;Galileo continued his work on motion and on mechanics and began to get involved in disputes about Copernicanism. Galileo showed a marked tendency to use all his discoveries as evidence for Copernicanism and to do so with great verbal as well as mathematical skill. Copernicanism was in contradiction with Scripture and in 1616 Galileo was given some kind of secret but official warning that he was not to defend Copernicanism. Just what was said on this occasion was to become a subject for dispute when Galileo was accused of departing from this undertaking in his 'Dialogue concerning the two greatest world systems' published in 1632.;x

EVENTHIST193039;At the death of Gian Gastone, the last of the ruling house of Medici, Francesco II became King of Italy in 1737 in exchange for giving up his Duchy of Lorraine. He was the husband of Maria Theresa, heir to the Habsburg domains, and was elected emperor in 1745. He lived in Vienna and never visited Italy. Although the country was reasonably well administered under his reign it was very heavily taxed to support Francesco's court and Austria's wars. Under the reign of Francesco II Italy became more firmly attached to the Habsburg dynasty then ever.;x

EVENTNAME193042;Giovanni Pico della Mirandola;x
EVENTHIST193042;Born in the Castle of Mirandola - at the age of fourteen went to Bologna to study Canon Law, but, repelled by the purely positivist science of Law, he traveled to chief universities of Italy and France where he studied Hebrew, Syriac, Arabic, Latin and Greek as well as the philosophy of Averroes. In December 1486, Pico published in Rome his 900 these. In his later life he dedicated his work to defending Christianity against the Jews and Mohammedans and became a follower of Savonarola. His interest in Kabbalah led to a broad current of Christian Kabbalahism which included John Reuchlin and remained important throughout the 16th century.;x
#;x
EVENTNAME5240;Leonardo da Vinci;x
EVENTHIST5240;Da Vinci was an Italian painter draftsman sculptor architect and engineer whose genius perhaps more than that of any figure epitomized the Renaissance humanist ideal. His 'Last Supper' and 'Mona Lisa' are among the most widely popular and influential paintings of the Renaissance. His notebooks reveal a spirit of scientific inquiry and a mechanical inventiveness that were centuries ahead of their time.;x

EVENTNAME193056;Catasto;x
EVENTHIST193056;Giovanni de' Medici is responsible for the introduction of the catasto, a new system of taxation on declarations of assets, not of income, which is easily disguised. It is a very popular act as one chronicler puts it, now the common folk have the satisfaction of seeing 'those who previously paid 20 florins are now paying 300'. The excitement was appeased by Giovanni de' Medici, who said, It is not well to go into things so long past, unless to learn something for our present guidance, and if in former times the taxation has been unjust, we ought to be thankful, that we have now discovered a method of making it equitable, and hope that this will be the means of uniting the citizens, not of dividing them, which would certainly be the case were they to attempt the recovery of taxes for the past, and make them equal to the present, and that he who is content with a moderate victory is always most successful, for those who would more than conquer, commonly lose.;x

In facts many were the interests of the House of Habsburg in exercising its hegemonic power in Italy in order to chase any Bourbon interference out of the peninsula. During his rule, Francesco II preferred to live in Vienna and never visited Italy. Although the country was reasonably well administered under his reign, Italy was very heavily taxed to support Francesco's court and Austria's wars. Under the reign of Francesco II Italy became more firmly attached to the Habsburg dynasty then ever.;x

Now he has come here with an army and unfurled the red dragon battle-flag of Cadwaladr, the last King of all Britannia. If we ignore his presumption and support him he has a good chance of success.

EVENTHIST337832;Treaty of Passarowitz was the peace treaty signed on July 21, 1718 between the Ottoman Empire on one side and the Habsburg Monarchy of Austria and the Republic of Venice on the other.

The treaty reflected the military situation. The Ottoman Empire lost the Banat of Temeswar, northern Serbia , northern Bosnia and Lesser Wallachia to Austria. Venice lost its possessions on the Peloponnesus peninsula and on Crete, gained by the Treaty of Karlowitz, retaining only the Ionian Islands and Dalmatia.

EVENTNAME337835;Livorno: Porto franco, Free Port;x
EVENTHIST337835;In the late 1580s, Ferdinando I de Medici declared Livorno a ''porto Franco'', which meant that the goods traded here were duty free. The "Leggi Livornine" were laws which ruled between 1590 and 1603. These laws helped the trading activities of the merchant, freedom of religion and amnesty for some penance. Thanks to these laws, Livorno became a cosmopolitan city and one of the most important ports of the entire Mediterranean area. Many foreigners moved to Livorno, Armenians, Dutch, English, Greeks, and Jews, were among those who relocated to live and trade. Some Moriscos also moved to Livorno. On the 19th of March 1606, the Granduca di Toscana Ferdinando I de' Medici, in the Fortezza Vecchia Chapel of Saint Francis of Assisi elevated Livorno at the rank of city. During the Napoleonic Wars, trade with England was prohibited and the economy of Livorno suffered greatly.;x

EVENTNAME_DUTCHNOBILITY;Dutch Nobility demands General Estates;x
EVENTHIST_DUTCHNOBILITY;In 1566 Dutch Nobles came to the King in an effort to stop the persecution of the Inquisition and to let the General Estates convene. The only answer they got was from the Count de Barlaymont who said 'Ces Gueux' (These Beggars!) in a spiteful voice. The Dutch took to that name with pride, calling themselves 'The Geuses'. One of the effects of the insulting denial was that in several cities churches were stormed, destroying relics and paintings. Knowing the effect on the King, William of Oranien tried to stop these acts of violence, but it was futile. The grass had caught fire...;x

#;x
EVENTNAME_DUTCHNOBLES;Nobles Demand Rights;x
EVENTHIST_DUTCHNOBLES;By caving into the Dutch demands for lower taxes at more local rule, a dangerous precedent was set. Throughout the empire, various states would step forth demanding that they be allowed the privileges that had been granted to the Dutch. Granting them the same benefits would severely limit the powers of the Crown.;x
#;x
EVENTNAME_EDICTBLOOD;Edict of Blood;x
EVENTHIST_EDICTBLOOD;In 1567 elite troops were brought in determined to break the Dutch Insurrection. The Edict of Blood was issued, which allowed the army to create a harsh military dictatorship with mass-arrests and courts of honour as a daily routine. The Terror of the Inquisition was intensified and hundreds of people were executed. In 1568 the counts of Hoorn and Egmont were arrested and executed making William of Oranien the only leader left to take up the flag. In 1570 the army introduced a 10 percent tax even as the Dutch had paid a two-year tax that the General estates had agreed upon on the promise of no more extra taxes. A General Strike spread in the Netherlands...In 1573 it was clear that the elite army had failed to subjugate the Dutch.;x

EVENTNAME_UNIONARRAS;Union of Arras;x
EVENTHIST_UNIONARRAS;After the failure of the Edict of Blood a more humane policy was adopted. It was understood that the Netherlands could only be kept if the wishes of the catholic provinces were agreed upon. In 1579 the Union of Arras was signed with the Catholic provinces of Artois and Hainault. In response, some of the Northern provinces then created the Union of Utrecht, the first sign of a new country. In addition to the northern provinces, all of the key southern cities, Bruges, Ghent, Antwerp, Brussels, and Brabant, joined the union despite apathy from their surrounding territories.;x

EVENTNAME_BRACOUNCIL;The Dissolution of the Council of State;x
EVENTHIST_BRACOUNCIL;From the start of Dutch Revolt a lack of central authority had made it difficult for the provinces to coordinate their efforts against royalist forces. By 1581 it was decided to setup Council of State, located in Brabant, to direct the war from a single command center. However, a competing council was also setup to direct forces in the northern theater. The division of Dutch forces allowed for a royalist resurgence in Brabant and Flanders. Viewing the southern lowlands as a lost cause, the Council of State in Brabant dissolved itself in 1583.;x
ACTIONNAME_BRACOUNCILA;Regain control;x
#;x
EVENTNAME_DUTCHSUCCESS;The Union of Utrecht claims independence;x
EVENTHIST_DUTCHSUCCESS;In 1579 the Northern provinces in the Low Countries signed the Union of Utrecht as countermeasure to the Union of Arras, which the Southern provinces signed as a guarantee of allegiance to their suzerain in exchange of more freedom under condition that Catholic religion was to be restored and practiced in those lands. As answer to these concessions which were clearly driven to force-convert and subjugate the Dutch population, the largely Protestant and Reformed Northern provinces of the Low Countries of the Union of Utrecht proclaimed their independence from the 'tyrannical and untrustworthy' suzerain and convened their own General Estates with the representatives of the seven rebelling provinces in the presiding province of Holland at The Hague. As a result of this, we are swiftly losing control of large holdings in the Netherlands to the victorious Dutch rebels. More local nobles and magnates seem to be joining the Dutch cause every day. We must strike swiftly and without mercy if we want to put a stop to this outrage and save our finances!;x
ACTIONNAME_DUTCHSUCCESSA;Those 'Gueux' must pay!;x
#;x
EVENTNAME_DUTCHREPDEF;The Restoration in the Low Countries;x
EVENTHIST_DUTCHREPDEF;In the first decades of the XVII century fierce religious struggles unceasingly prosecuted in the Low Countries and the Catholic army took up the offensive in the Netherlands winning victory after victory. The Dutch again opened the dykes to flood the enemy, but it backfired and they lost most of their elite troops. In 1625 Breda capitulated, and in 1627 Nijmegen fell, while the Lansquenets moved into Geldern and threatened Utrecht. But the best was yet to come. After winning a night-time sea battle the Catholic navy landed a large army in Zeeland, and within a year control was regained over the quarrelsome subjects. During the years until the Peace of The Hague, all non-Catholics were harshly subjugated. Catholics were given preferment and local self-governance. A pact between all the Catholic subjects and the suzerain was instituted. Many Calvinists, unwilling to be force-converted to Catholicism, had to leave the Netherlands for the newly born overseas colonies in South Africa and in the South East Indies. In 1648 with the end of the Eighty Years War against the Dutch rebels, the world at last acknowledged our rightful rule in the Low Countries.;x
ACTIONNAME_DUTCHREPDEF;Those 'Gueux' are tamed!;x
#;x
EVENTNAME_DUTCHREPSUC;End of Dutch revolte;x
EVENTHIST_DUTCHREPSUC;After the initial failures of 1580-1590s and a prolonged cease-fire, in the first decades of the XVII century the enemy took up the offensive in the Low Countries again. The entrepreneurial and thrifty Dutch people were soon on the move, bearing all the costs of war in strengthening coastal and inland defences, both given by nature's favour or by man's skills, and stopping any enemy landing from the sea by means of an invincible fleet, the 'Gueux de mer' (The Sea Beggars). All of this constituted the defensive tactics made necessary to compensate the impossibility to have large armies available in battlefields. Even if in 1625 Breda capitulated and in 1627 Nijmegen fell while the enemy hired Lansquenets were moving into Geldern and threatened Utrecht, the Dutch independentists managed to withstand the invasion and to strengthen their national cohesion. In 1648, at the Peace of The Hague which ended the Eighty Years War between the United Provinces of the Low Countries (the Netherlands) and their former suzerain, the world at last acknowledged the legitimate self-determination of the Dutch people to rule themselves over their own country.;x

Without a central authority to keep order, the salt-gold trade was disrupted. With the rise of European trade along the coast, the Sudan lost its importance to world trade.

For those that escaped it was far from over as a heavy breeze of wind suddenly started to come in over the area beating the small fires into a virtual inferno incinerating thousands. But yet thousands of people would fall victim for the grand tidal wave reaching land just a few minutes later.

Presided over by Chief Justice William Stoughton, the court was made up of magistrates and jurors. The first to be tried was Bridget Bishop of Salem who was found guilty and was hanged on June 10. Thirteen women and five men from all stations of life followed her to the gallows on three successive hanging days before the court was disbanded by Governor William Phipps in October of that year. The Superior Court of Judicature, formed to replace the 'witchcraft' court, did not allow spectral evidence. This belief in the power of the accused to use their invisible shapes or spectres to torture their victims had sealed the fates of those tried by the Court of Oyer and Terminer.

EVENTNAME338024;The Plague in Venice;x
EVENTHIST338024;In the XVIth century if the city was losing its central role politically, demographically it was continually expanding. With over 175,000 inhabitants it was one of the most densely-populated cities in the world. Venice, being protected by the lagoon and because of its merchant nature, had recurrent pestilences, and drinking water was so scarce in the city and of such bad quality, that those that could afford it drank almost exclusively watered wine. The nobility took refuge in their villas in Terraferma when pestilences hit, while most Doges made a point of honor to remain in the city, and several of them died of plagues. In the three years between 1575 and 1577 the Serenissima was tormented by the plague: aided by the high density of the population, the disease spread through the city, causing terrible losses, with a dramatic new outbreak in the summer of the second year. Almost 50,000 died, which was more than a third of the city's inhabitants. Due mainly to promiscuity and precarious living conditions, the disease spread almost exclusively among the poorer classes. Initially the seriousness of the epidemic was played down, but as the disease spread the government was forced to adopt extreme hygiene and sanitary regulations which helped to eradicate the disease after the first dramatic months. The Senate decided that the Doge should announce the vow to erect a church dedicated to the Redentore (Redeemer), in return for help in ending the plague. With the plague not yet officially eradicated, the first stone of Palladio's votive church was laid. On 13 July 1577 the plague was declared definitively over and it was decided that the city's liberation from the terrible disease should be celebrated on the third Sunday in July for years to come.;x

EVENTHIST338084;Horrified by the bloody pagan beliefs of the Aztecs, and wishing to impose Catholicism on their new subjects, the Spaniards systematically destroyed the Aztec temples. One of the hundreds of temples destroyed was the temple of the goddess Tonantzin, located on Tepeyac Hill. Tonantzin was a manifestation dedicated to childbirth of the Earth Mother (Coatlicue). In 1521 the Aztec Quauhtlatoatzin was baptized by Franciscans and named Juan Diego. Between December 9 and 12, 1531, the Virgin of Guadalupe appeared at Tepeyac Hill four times to him speaking in Náhuatl, and performed the miracle of growing Spanish roses in winter and imprinting her image in his apron. The natives identified this dark skinned Virgin, that spoke Náhuatl with the goddess Tonantzin. The possibility of fusing their pre-Hispanic beliefs with the new religion triggered the massive conversion of millions of Aztecs. The first chuch was built in Tepeyac in 1533, in what is today the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe. She was declared Patron of Mexico in 1737 and chosen as symbol for the independence of Mexico in 1810. Juan Diego died on May 30, 1548 and was beatified in 1990 and canonized in 2002 by Pope John Paul II.;x

EVENTNAME338097;Knights-robbers in Silesia;x
EVENTHIST338097;At the end of medieval ages knights-robbers (German - Raubritter) became a serious social problem in Silesia and Lusatia. They put knight ideas aside and using their military skills they decided to make fortunes on criminal actions such as robberies, thefts and murders. Since this profession was relatively safe and very lucrative, whole families were making money this way and the profession was inherited by sons from fathers. Relatively dense network of castles and strongholds in Sudety mountains and its foothills was a perfect base for robberies. Individual bands amounted from few to even several dozens of persons. As they were mostly robbing merchants on trade routs it severely influenced trade incomes and trade exchange. How do we deal with them Sir?;x

EVENTNAME338111;Volta and the first battery;x
EVENTHIST338111;Volta was an italian physicist who constructed a device for accumulating a large charge by a series of inductions and groundings. He investigated the 'animal electricity' of Galvani and found that the current was generated from the contact of dissimilar metals, and that the frog leg was only acting as a detector. Using this principle, in 1800 he constructed the first battery to produce electricity. Volta's method of stacking round plates of copper and zinc separated by disks of cardboard moistened with salt solution was termed a Voltaic pile. By touching the copper and zinc disks together, Volta showed them to be oppositely charged.;x

In 1608 he offered his 'Instrument for seeing into the distance' to the council of Zeeland, which immediately ordered six of Lipperhey's telescopes. The new invention soon spread. In 1609 the first telescopes were sold in Paris, and Galileo constructed his one and used it for observing the skies for the first time.;x

In 'Theory of the Earth with Proofs and Illustrations' (1795), Hutton became the first to show that, in general, the Earth changes slowly and uniformly by the same processes which are occurring today. Hutton did not have as much impact as he might have had, as a result of his cumbersome and difficult literary style. Hutton's idea became known as the Uniformitarian Principle, and served as an alternative to Catastrophism. Hutton believed that volcanic processes were the chief agent in rock formation, thus representing the Vulcanist (or Plutonist) view, in contrast to men such as Werner who supported the Neptunist view.;x

EVENTNAME338114;Piazzi and the discovery of Ceres;x
EVENTHIST338114;On the first day of January 1801, the Italian astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi, who had established an observatory at Palermo, discovered an object which he first thought was a new comet. But after its orbit was determined it was clear that it was like a small planet. Piazzi named it Ceres, after the Sicilian goddess of grain. Three other small bodies were discovered in the next few years: Pallas, Vesta and Juno (now we know hundreds of thousands). Ceres was the first discovered object of the asteroid belt. Piazzi was able to make only three observations, but fortuitously, Gauss had recently developed mathematical techniques that allowed the orbit to be calculated with only three observed positions of the body. When the orbit was calculated by Gauss, it showed that Ceres was not a comet, but a new little planet.;x

EVENTNAME338115;Gauss, the prince of mathematics;x
EVENTHIST338115;The German Karl Friedrich Gauss was one of the greatest mathematicians of all times. He proved the fundamental theorem of algebra and the fundamental theorem of arithmetics. At age 24, Gauss published one of the most brilliant achievements in mathematics, 'Disquisitiones Arithmeticae', where he systematized the study of number theory. In 1801, Gauss developed the method of least squares fitting, the method enabled him to calculate the orbit of the asteroid Ceres, which had been discovered by Piazzi, from only three observations. Gauss published his monumental treatise on celestial mechanics 'Theoria Motus' in 1806. He worked for the Duke of Brunswick, but when he was killed fighting for the Prussian army, Gauss left Brunswick. In 1807 he took up the position of director of the Göttingen observatory.;x

EVENTHIST338127;The profound damage caused by the war between Ethiopia and Adal left most of the provinces defenceless and depopulated. The opportunity was seized by a large group living in Kenya, that had a strong population pressure. They called themselves the Oromo, but were called Galla by the Ethiopians. Their society was based on an age-set system known as gada, by which all males born within an 8 year period were grouped together for the rest of their lives. This system, together with the luba, or warrior class, gave them a great military advantage, and neither Ethiopia, nor Adal were in conditions of presenting an effective defense against such threat. The Oromo, thus, completely wrecked both states, and their plundeing of crops and cattle caused yet another depopulation. However, the Oromo were profoundly divided in clans that fought each other, and were not concerned with establishing an empire or imposing their pagan beliefs.;x

While the conversion was mostly voluntarily, as a way of advancing socially, the Oromo surrounding Harar (Arsi), were converted by the military expeditions of the Emir Ali Ibn Dawoud, while the military campaigns of several Ethiopian emperors also contributed to religious conversion to Christian Orthodox faith.

EVENTHIST338167;Spanish tolerance for the Muslims in their midst had steadily been declining over the course of the 16th Century. The rise of Ottoman power in the Balkans and North Africa exacerbated the problem by creating a real security risk for the Christian Kings of Spain as there were numerous instances where Spanish Muslims aided Turkish pirates in their slaving raids on Christian villages in Spain. After the Alpujarras Revolt of 1568-70 and the failure of the consequent dispersion of the Mudejars throughout Spain to better integrate the Mudejars into Spanish society, the Kings of Spain were determined to end the Moorish problem for once and for all. But not until Spain was at peace would the Kingdom be able to muster the troops and ships required to expel the Mudejars from Spanish soil.

The war of Arauco started in 1544, after the city of Santiago had been destroyed by chieftain Michimaloco. In response Pedro de Valdivia initiated a campaign to pacify the region, and was attacked at Quilacura. Despite his victory, he saw that the Araucanians were of great courage. After returning from Peru in 1550, Valdivia continued his campaigns until 1553, when he was defeated and captured by Lautaro and killed in torment.

He still had some problems with one of his soldiers, the mestizo (mixed-blood) Alejandro de Vivar, whose mother had been kidnapped by the Mapuche and bore him with a chieftain before being rescued. Due to discrimination, the mestizo Alejo deserted to the Mapuche and became a successful war leader until he was killed, allegedly by his own wives, in 1660. In 1645 Valdivia had been repopulated, and in 1657 Concepción was rebuilt after an earthquake.

The first expeditions were successful in bypassing Portuguese dominion of the Cape of Good Hope and the Indian Ocean in general. The Dutch also managed to break the Portuguese monopoly of the spice trade. As the Dutch fleets grew in size, so did their interference with Portuguese trade, and the first skirmishes took place. By 1619, the Dutch conquered Jayakarta which they rename Batavia and make it their EastIndies capital.

EVENTNAME338260;Conversion of the Inca;x
EVENTHIST338260;The Inca cult of the sun was quite similar to the Catholic religion. They believed in a supreme god, practiced praying and forgiveness of sins by priests, and believed in an afterlife to be won after a just life. Moreover they were used to the cult of the sun being imposed over conquered cultures as a top layer. The Catholic Church of Perú therefore did not have much problem in being accepted as the supreme religion, even though from the first Council of Lima in 1551, it declared that nobody could be forced to convert. In the second Council of Lima in 1567, that was called to adapt to the Council of Trent, further measures to promote evangelization were taken. The use of aboriginal languages by priests was recommended, together with rules on how to enhance the dignity and moral customs of the natives, including personal hygiene recommendations. The third Council of Lima, carried out in 1582 under the direction of St. Toribio, resulted in the translation of the Catechism to quechua and aymara, and in a strong defense of the Indians against injustices. As a result of the Church efforts, by the end of the XVI century the Incas had been fully converted, at least in appearance.;x

EVENTNAME338261;Idolatry in Perú;x
EVENTHIST338261;The natives of Perú had found a way to merge their traditional beliefs with Catholicism. But in 1608, a criollo (mixed-race) priest, Francisco de Avila discovered behind the festivity of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, a pagan adoration to Pariacaca and Chaupiñamocc. Using this discovery to promote his own personal advancement, he captured the pagan high priest, Hernando Paucar, and on December 20, 1609 he conducted a gigantic ''Auto de Fe'' at Lima, where old mummies and idols where destroyed, and Paucar flogged. Afterwards he was named visitador (traveling judge) of idolatry, conducting the first of several campaigns to destroy altars and idols and attempt to erradicate idolatry that would last until 1670. From then on, the Church adopted a more tolerant attitude towards native harmless superstitions.;x

EVENTNAME338291;Romanian dominance in Transylvania;x
EVENTHIST338291;Wallachia is traditionally considered to have been founded in 1290 by Radu Negru ('Ralph the Black'), a Romanian vaivode (military governor) of Fagaras in southern Transylvania. Basarab I (133052) defeated the Hungarian King Charles I Robert in 1330 and secured Wallachian independence. However, it proved short-lived. In 1391 Prince Mircea the Old (13861418) was obliged to pay tribute to the Turks, and in 1417 he acknowledged Ottoman suzerainty. Wallachia was allowed to retain its own dynasty, territory and religion but was obliged to pay tribute to the Sultan and act in accordance with his wishes. However, some of its subsequent princes revived Wallachia's resistance - notably Vlad III the Impaler ('Dracula') and Michael the Brave (15931601), who briefly united Wallachia with Moldavia and Transylvania.

In 1522 he entered the service of Bahar Khan Nuhani, the ruler of Bihar, who rewarded his ability by appointing him as deputy (vakil) and also the tutor of his son, Jalal Khan.

Infuriated by this move, on October 7, 1774, the General Court of Massachusetts dissolved the colony and setup a provincial congress to combat the tightening control of the King.

Of its population of about 12,000 people, as many as 5,400 were recorded as having been connected with the wool trade.

EVENTNAME338407;The treaty of Copenhagen;x
EVENTHIST338407;The Treaty of Copenhagen (or the Peace of Copenhagen) was signed in 1441 between the Hanseatic League and Holland. The accord was developed after Christopher of Bavaria crushed a great peasant uprising in Northern Jutland. The treaty broke the attempted monopoly of Baltic trading routes by the Hanseatic League. Even though Hanseatic trade regulations did not change, the Dutch (with their larger trading vessels) increased their control on herring fisheries, the French salt trade, and the Baltic grain trade. In short, the Baltic Sea was open and influenced by Dutch traders. The Hanseatic merchants eventually became middlemen whereby they transported bulk goods (i.e. lumber, grain, fish) from the Baltic and exchanged them for textiles and other finished products. The treaty did not affect the control of Hanse trading outposts in London, Bruges, Danzig, and Bergen. Based on the terms of the agreement, Dutch towns promised to pay or return twenty-two lost Prussian and Livonian ships. Moreover, the Dutch would pay 5,000 guldens to the Danish King to maintain their trading privileges in Denmark, as well as pay the damages they made to Wendish towns.;x

EVENTNAME338411;Great Hajj;x
EVENTHIST338411;After the rise of the Islamic empire, Mecca attracted pilgrims from all over the extensive empire, as well as a year-round population of scholars, pious Muslims who wished to live close to the Kaaba, and local inhabitants who served the pilgrims. Due to the difficulty and expense of the Hajj, the annual pilgrimage was small compared to the millions that swell Mecca today. Pilgrims arrived by boat, at Jeddah, and came overland, or joined the annual caravans from Syria or Iraq. The city was small. 18th and 19th century maps and pictures show a small walled city of mud-brick houses crowded around the mosque. \nHowever, once in a while a larger group of pilgrims of a pilgrim of great reputation would make a Hajj, and stimulate the local economy. The most famous of those is probably Mansa Musa, ruler of Mali, in 1324. He was reportedly accompanied by a caravan that included thousands of people and nearly a hundred camels, giving away so much gold that it took over a decade for the economy across North Africa to recover, due to the rapid inflation that it initiated.;x

EVENTHIST338412;Móðuharðindin (literally, The Mist Hardships) was a natural disaster in Iceland in the years 1783-1785 following the volcanic eruption of Laki volcano. \n \nThe hardship began with the eruption of the volcano in Lakagígar on June 8, 1783, which was one of the greatest volcanic eruptions in historical times. The eruption devastated Iceland and the environmental effects could be felt in many places of the world due to the severe global meteorological effects of the rising sulphuric fumes. A contemporary account of the eruption can be found in the Eldrit of pastor Jón Steingrímsson, which was printed in 1788. \n \nAfter the volcano erupted, a poisonous mist settled over the entire country, burning up grazing lands and killing cattle.

In 1496, soon after the French loot of the village of Salses at the border of Roussillon and its old Middle Age castle, Ferdinand ordered him to build a modern fortress. He built it from 1497 to 1503 using innovative principles, inspired from Italy, in order to protect the fortress from the artillery and to optimize the fire of the cannons from the castle. This fort was considered as impregnable with his 15m thick walls at the base. It was supposed to have a 3,000 men garrison (that it never had) and till our days it surprises us by its size, its short shape, its surrounding ditches, half-moons and counterscarps. \n \nIn 1503, Francisco Ramiro also participated to the construction of the military port of Collioure, at the Pyrenees feet, inspiring himself from his work in Salses. The castle of Salses, taken by the French in 1639, taken back in 1640 and once again conquered in 1642 would be later hardly improved by Sébastien Vauban's works. The fort lost of its importance after 1659 when the border went to the Pyrenean range. \n \nIf Francisco Ramiro Lopez' work has been an important step in military architecture, he never had the intuition of the earth ramparts. On the contrary, he preferred the systematic use of stones and mortar and it is in Italy, at Civita Vecchia in 1508, that the first earth bastion was built. So, later, it would be mainly Italians architects that Carlos V would use to build his fortresses.;x

Such regional particularism firstly prevented a strong central authority. Secondly, portentously, it led to the development of factionalism amongst the people. The fate of all these medieval Slavic states, as it was for all of the Balkans, was annexation, one by one, by the growing Ottoman empire or Latin nations. Characteristic of the people, they were never able to remain unified, the end result of a legacy of strong sense of tribal autonomy, opposing influences from external powers, and perhaps even individual greed for power at the expense of thought for the common good.;x

But the language of the edict raised the hackles of the Europeans. First, it said that they ''behave more like animals than Christians.'' Second, it referred to Chinese who lived in the colony as Chenggong's subjects. Third, and most important, it threatened punishment not only for Chinese but also for ''anyone outside of our nation who extends money for trade with Manila.''

EVENTNAME115;The Gregorian Calendar;x
EVENTHIST115;The Gregorian calendar was proposed by Aloysius Lilius, a physician from Naples, and adopted by Pope Gregory XIII in accordance with instructions from the Council of Trent (1545-1563) to correct for errors in the older Julian Calendar. In February, 1582, Pope Gregory XIII issued a Papal Bull requiring that 10 days should be dropped from October 1582 so that 15 October should follow immediately after 4 October, and from then on the reformed calendar should be used. This was observed in Italy, Poland, Portugal, and Spain. Other Catholic countries followed shortly after, the Rest of the World adopted it only after 1700. In most countries it was also decided to adopt 1 January as the start of the year at the same time. In the Gregorian calendar, the tropical year is approximated as 365 97/400 days = 365.2425 days. Thus it takes approximately 3300 years for the tropical year to shift one day with respect to the Gregorian calendar. The approximation 365 97/400 is achieved by having 97 leap years every 400 years. These are calculated introducing a new corrective device to curb further error: century years such as 1700 or 1800 are no longer to be counted as leap years, unless they are like 1600 divisible by 400. If somewhat inelegant, this system was undeniably effective since the Gregorian calendar differed from solar year only by 26 seconds.;x

By the end of the Thirty Year's War, the era of the so called Counter-Reformation was at a close. Concurrent with an increase of religious tolerance, the Treaty of Tordesillas was no longer viewed as an impediment to non-Spanish, non-Portuguese colonization. The boundaries of the Holy Roman Empire were also revised accordingly.;x

EVENTHIST137015;The nobility of France was waging a civil war. Charles VI's madness had facilitated this process, as two rival factions, the Burgundians, and the Armagnacs, had jockeyed for control over the King for more than a decade. Both factions had exchanged positions several times over the course of the war. The feud had resulted in the murder of Louis Duke of Orleans in the streets of Paris, and years later, several more Armagnac Lords when John 'the Fearless' entered Paris in 1418. The Dauphin, Charles, now led the remnants of the Armagnac faction. On September 10, 1419, a meeting at Montereau took place between the Dauphin and the Duke of Burgundy, after a tentative agreement had been made between the two factions not long ago. During the meeting, tempers flared. The Dauphin made a hasty retreat, while the Duke of Burgundy and his few retainers were cut to pieces.

EVENTHIST137056;Henry V, the Lancastrian King of England, appeared triumphant. Normandy had been reconquered and he was on excellent terms with Philip Duke of Burgundy whom supported Henry's bid for the throne of France. The Dauphin Charles seemed incapable of continuing the fight residing in exile south of the Loire. Philip and Henry V now controlled King Charles VI and his promiscuous Queen, Isabel, and was able to make them accept anything, even the disavowal of Charles and recognition of the rights to the succession of the Lancasters as heirs to Edward III's revived claim to the throne of France. Supporting the rights of Henry V seemed a bold move, but it guaranteed the removal of remnants of the Armagnac party, secured Burgundian sovereingty, and moreover, presented itself as a perfect opportunity to subscribe the murderers of his father.;x

EVENTNAME137057;Resumption of Hostilities in France;x
EVENTHIST137057;After the refusal of Philip the Good to accept the Treaty of Troyes, Henry V decided to take up arms immediately. The Dauphin Charles remained isolated south of the Loire, but could not be expected to continue in such a state for long. Philip needed to decide whethter he would lead the French against the English invaders, or effectively withdraw. On the one hand, he was risking his Duchy against the English to win the unanimous support of northern France. It was feasible that Henry V would respond with an alliance with the Dauphin, which would spell certain doom for Philip. On the other hand, Philip could effectively withdraw from the field, burying vengeance in the meantime, and leave northern France for the Dauphinists and the English to waste away over.;x

EVENTNAME137058;The Treaty of Orleans;x
EVENTHIST137058;From the negotiations at Troyes emerged a treaty that was eventually signed at Orleans. Henry V, enomoured with Charles' daughter Katherine, demanded her hand in marriage and the Duchies of Normandy and Guyenne free from liege homage. It was in effect a return to Henry's demands before the bulk of England's forces had landed in Normandy, and to what the Armagnacs had promised him years before. After spending several years as prisoners in London, Charles Duke of Orleans and Jean Duke of Bourbon were ransomed back to France, and subsequently lent the treaty their full support. More importantly, Henry V was to renounce his claim to the throne of France, and Charles VI was constrained to agree to the proposal. The English were pacified and the Armagnacs proclaimed the event a diplomatic success. Eager to solidify popular support and capture an air of legitimacy, the Kings of England and France, and the Dukes of Bourbon and Orleans would hold a public ceremony in Paris where each participant swore to uphold the treaty stipulations. Henry V formally renounced his claim to the throne of France. Philip, Duke of Burgundy, had stormed out of the negotiations, furious at the English reversal. Philip refused to attend the ceremonies. The Dauphin and the Armagnacs needed to pay reparitions for their haneous crime at Montereau.;x

EVENTNAME137060;The Estate of Charles VI;x
EVENTHIST137060;The death of Charles VI and the still unstable military situation left Philip the Good alone at the head of a shaky royal government. This position would not have been awkward if, in Bourges, there had not been the Dauphin, legitimate heir to the crown. For the Duke of Burgundy, denying the rights of the Dauphin with the support of the Parliament of Paris would allow him to approach the throne, but to let the throne go to Charles VII at a price was also a possibility. Charles was prepared to amend the assassination of Philip's father, free the Dukes of Burgundy from liege homage to the Crown of France, and grant Philip disputed territory in the north east of France that included the Somme towns.;x

EVENTNAME137061;Henry VI Inherits the Crown of France;x
EVENTHIST137061;Charles VI the insane King of France died on October 21, 1422. In accordance with the Treaty of Troyes, Henry V's son, the infant King Henry VI, was to inherit the Crown of St. Louis. Henry V had died a little more than a month before Charles VI however, and in his will he had stipulated that Philip Duke of Burgundy should be made Regent of France should the Duke accept. Nevertheless, when the English approached Philip with the offer, the Duke politely refused. Accepting the Regency would have vastly increased Philip's dependency on the English and was a prospect that was not terribly endearing to the youthful Duke who's predecessors had, for decades, striven to further Burgundy's independence. Moreover, the Lancastrian regime had yet to establish themselves firmly in France, and were far from having secured the vast inheritance for their boy King. At this stage in the war the outcome was hardly guaranteed for either side.;x

EVENTNAME137062;Dauphinists Rebel;x
EVENTHIST137062;Duke Phillipe had all but usurped the throne from the late Charles VI's heir, Charles. Although Paris had long been purged of Dauphinist supporters, nobles, clergy and commoner alike in a large swathe of northern France sympathized with whom they felt was their rightful heir. Many of Charles's supporters fled to territories occupied by those still loyal tot he Dauphin. Some, however, remained, and would devote a significant amount of time and effort resisting the Burgundian Duke's government.;x

EVENTNAME137063;Treaty of Amiens, 1423;x
EVENTHIST137063;After the death of Charles VI, John of Lancaster, Duke of Bedford and now Regent of France continued to seek the aid of Philip. The Treaty of Troyes bound the English to embark upon the monumental task of subduing southern France, thus securing the true ascension of their boy-king, Henry VI, to the throne of France. Burgundy's aid would be critical for the success of such a campaign. Thus Bedford approached Philip and John VI, Duke of Brittany, with a proposal for an alliance between the three dukes. Aiding the English would certainly help secure a sovereign future for Burgundy and give Philip the opportunity to persue vengeance against the dis-inherited Dauphin Charles for the death of Philip's father, John, aswell as further Philip's aspirations for his Burgundian state. However, the people of France yearned for French unity and a French King, and an English King certainly contradicted these desires. At Amiens, Bedford had proposed a marriage alliance and so Philip offered his sisters, Anne and Margaret as brides for Bedford and Arthur of Brittany, Earl of Richmond. Philip had to weigh his choices carefully. After some deliberation, Philip and John VI would proceed with the English alliance, acknowledging Bedford as Regent of France, and reaffirming the Treaty of Troyes, but would make a secret pact with each other to remain committed should their mutual alliance with England fail.;x

EVENTHIST137064;At Amiens, Bedford had proposed a marriage alliance and so Philip offered his sisters Anne and Margaret to Bedford and Arthur of Brittany, Earl of Richmond, respectively. After a careful deliberation, John VI, Duke of Brittany and Philip decided rejected the proposal. Nevertheless, the two dukes approached one another in secret, and John and Philip agreed to a pact of mutual aid and friendship in the event of any future English hostility.;x
#;x
EVENTNAME137065;A Gift of Several Counties;x
EVENTHIST137065;The treaty of Troyes not only made Henry V successor of Charles VI, it confirmed him both as the sovereign lord and as the ally of Philip, Duke of Burgundy which meant, in practical terms, that Philip was staking his own great authority, both as lord and as leader of a political faction in France, behind the treaty. Such support was of incalculable value to the English. It meant that, where necessary, ducal pressure could be brought to bear upon individuals and corporations to accept the treaty's terms, and when Henry V died, it led to a more rapid and more general acceptance of his young son in Burgundian-controlled lands than might otherwise have been achieved. No small wonder, then, that Philip was given several counties surrounding the County of Burgundy, and confirmed Philips Burgundian estates;x

EVENTNAME137067;Orleans Surrenders to Burgundy;x
EVENTHIST137067;During the English siege of the city of Orleans, the inhabitants of Orleans offered to surrender peacefully, provided Orleans would fall to the jurisdiction of the Duke of Burgundy, rather than Bedford. The English Regent of France, taken aback by this development, reacted harshly, rebutting what he considered to be an outrageous insult. Needless to say, the Duke of Burgundy became infuriated, and threatened to abandon Bedford's forces. After the two partys cooled, Bedford reluctantly agreed to the request. The English have granted us control of Orleans.;x

EVENTNAME137068;Joan's Advance;x
EVENTHIST137068;After the assassination of John the Fearless, Philip the Good had been allied with the King of England against the Dauphin and had allowed Henry V to impose the Treaty of Troyes. Although excluded from the regency by the English, the Duke of Burgundy remained the key to English domination in France, which pushed them to negotiate very expensively for his support. Charles of France, refugee in Bourges, undertook secret negotiations with the Duke, which led to a series of truces, giving hope for a recovery of the cause of the Valois. The intervention of Joan of Arc precipitated matters. By pushing the King of Bourges to go to Rheims to be crowned, she obliged the Duke of Burgundy to make a choice: to leave open the road to Rheims or to stop the Dauphin.;x

EVENTHIST137069;The countryside to the east and south of Paris had never truly accepted English rule. The Duke of Burgundy, particularly so in these lands so close to his own duchy, held more sway and had, for what it was worth, attempted to govern the region for most of Henry VI's reign. The English Regency, fearing a Burgundian lapse into neutrality, granted the county of Champagne to Philip. In return, Philip was to further prosecute the war against the Dauphin.;x

EVENTNAME137070;The Capture of the Maid;x
EVENTHIST137070;In April 1430, the wind had turned against the Maid, whose exploits, principally responsible for the French recovery, had put her at the center of political intrigues. By her martial spirit, she had become a threat to a possible Franco-Burgundian rapprochement, and there was obviously a sacrificial goal in dispatching her on a mission to Compiegne against Burgundy, which at the moment was only a nominal advisary. For Philip the Good, the capture of the Virgin was beautiful thing, but what to do with her: sell her to the English, or return her to Charles?;x

EVENTNAME137071;Joan strikes;x
EVENTHIST137071;After her failure in front of Paris, Joan seemed to have lost much of her aura since her triumph at Rheims. Charles VII, conscious that she had become a threat to Franco-Burgundian relations which he considered essential to recover all his royal holdings, agreed, under the pressure of his entourage, to dispatch her on various more or less suicidal missions so that she could find a glorious death. It is thus that in the spring of 1431, Joan for the first time had real orders for war. She left towards Compiegne where it was the idea for her to have her appointment with destiny. Instead, she gained a spectacular success. After Compiegne, in fact the the Picardy cities opened their doors to the Maid of Orleans. For Philip the Good as for Charles VII, it was not really what was envisaged!;x

Charles VII agreed at the same time not to claim homage from Artois and Flanders, and yielded the majority of the cities of the valley of Somme. For this exorbitant price, the King finally managed to detach Philip of his alliance with the English. The Hundred Years War finally reached its turning point.;x

Ensured of the support of the Parliament of Paris and being joined by many former Armagnac partisans after the failure of the cause of the Dauphin, the road towards the throne was now open.

If her rights on the Duchy of Burgundy and the other patrimonial lands could not be disputed, it was not so with the Crown of France, which could not fall to a woman.

But when word arrived in Scotland of the progress made by Henry they foresaw their own ruin if France was defeated.

EVENTNAME361002;On the bridge of Montereau;x
EVENTHIST361002;Under John the Fearless, Burgundy had become the most powerful vassal of France, and acted increasingly more independent with respect to the Crown. Charles VI's madness had faciliated a civil war within the ranks of the nobility in France. The Burgundians and the Armagnacs had jockeyed for control of Charles VI and both had periodically exchanged positions of strength. John had murdered Louis Duke of Orleans, in the streets of Paris and years later, had massacred many Armagnacs in Paris when he had entered the city in 1418. Those who survived had fled to the side of the Dauphin, Charles. Hesitating between a final alliance with Henry V and a reconciliation with the Dauphin Charles, the Duke agreed to meet Charles in Montereau. Tempers flared during the meeting, and John and his retainers were cut to pieces. The alternative was to face humiliating concessions...;x

EVENTHIST361010;Charles Dauphin of France had not attended the negotiations between Henry V and Charles VI at Troyes because he had not been invited. His father had been furious with the news of the Dauphin's actions at Montereau. Nevertheless, the negotiations had proceeded smoothly and had led to the Treaty of Orleans. This peace agreement secured for the King of England a daughter of Charles VI and the Duchies of Normandy and Guyenne in full sovereignty. Charles VI gained Henry V's renunciation of his claim to the Crown of France, and the Duke of Orleans and the Duke of Bourbon now had their freedom. Some within the Armagnac ranks were furious at Charles VI's territorial concessions, as their lands were now feifdoms of the Kingdom of England, and would deeply resent the treaty for years to come. However, the release of the Duke of Orleans and Duke of Bourbon soothed many tempers, and their adjutants were quick to return to the service of their lords. The Dauphin came to realize that England's renunciation of her claim of France was well worth the temporary loss of Guyenne. With Burgundy in disgrace, and Orleans and Bourbon in the ascendant at Charles VI's court, it only made sense to reconcile with his father...;x

However, he chose to negotiate a generous peace, contrary with his former declarations. Henry V was prepared to release the Dukes of Orleans and Bourbon. Both of whom, had been held captive in London since Agincourt. Furthermore, Henry V was to wed Katherine Valois, daughter of Charles VI. Lastly, the English would accept a large payment to cover Henry V's costs, his renunciation of the Crown of France, KAtherine's dowry, and the ransom for the two Dukes. In the meantime, Burgundy, abandoned by Henry V, could not maintain a hold on either PAris, or Charles VI. The Dauphin, and the principle Armagnac leaders, regained control of Charles VI.;x

EVENTHIST361031;Charles VII 'The Bold' of France died unexpectedly on January 5th, 1477, leaving a daughter as his sole issue. Salic law forbid the inheritance of the Crown by and through the female line. Louis's father, Charles, had been barred from the throne decades ago by then Duke Philippe of Burgundy, but no mention was made of Charles's future heirs. Thus, Louis stood to inherit the Crown of France.;x

EVENTHIST361033;If the succession of Philip the Good, in spite of his lack of legitimacy to the throne, had not posed a problem, it did at a time when the line of Valois-Burgundy seemed firmly established. A major crisis began when King Charles left a girl, Mary, as his only heir. If her rights on the Duchy of Burgundy and the other patrimonial lands could not be disputed, it was not so with the Crown of France, which could not fall to a woman. Who would finally claim the throne was far from obvious.;x

EVENTNAME164162;The Assassination of John the Fearless;x
EVENTHIST164162;On September 10, 1419, a meeting at Montereau, after a tentative agreement between the Dauphin and the Duke of Burgundy, turned into a pitched battle. After some insults, the two escorts launched into a confused fray during which John the Fearless received a fatal blow from an axe. For Burgundy, the only possible response to this affront was to ally with King Henry and crush this so-called Dauphin traitor!;x
ACTIONNAME164162A;Welcome our Cousin from Burgundy!;x
#;x
EVENTNAME164163;Negotiation at Troyes;x
EVENTHIST164163;The Treaty of Troyes grew primarily from the seeds ofHenry V's desires to press his claim to the throne of France, and thereby vindicate the Lancastrian usurpation of 1399 in the hearts and minds of the people of England. Indeed, it was the warrior King Edward III, Henry's great grandfather, who had pressed his claim and had inititiated the war with France decades ago. Henry's marriage to Katherine Valois, a daughter of Charles VI, was designed, in part, to add an element of legitimacy to Henry's future should he become King of France. The agreement which formed the basis of the treaty was that the Dauphin, Charles, was to be disinherited by his father and Henry V named heir in his place. The treaty committed Henry to conquer those lands in France currently held by the Dauphin Charles and his supporters. An important clause, however, maintained that any and all lands in France which Henry V held or may hold could not be detached from the Crown of France. Furthermore, the institutions of France were to be upheld and respected. Notably, the Duchy of Guyenne was exempted from this clause. Nevertheless, there were other options, as Henry could have exchanged the extraordinary prisoners from Agincourt, the Duke of Orleans and the Duke of Bourbon, among others, along with his claim to the Crown of France, for the Duchies of Normandy and Guyenne in full sovereignty. Orleans and Bourbon, the notable leaders of the Armagnac alliance along with the Dukes of Berry, Alencon, and the late Count of Armagnac Bernard VII, had offered Henry the Duchy of Guyenne in full sovereignty prior to Agincourt. Henry's father, Henry IV, had worked hard for an alliance with the Armagnacs during his reign. Henry V, however, had always preferred an alliance with Burgundy and had openly criticised his father's policy. Alternatively, though at a great cost to the stability of his regime and his own legacy, Henry could have renounced the claims to Normandy and the Crown of France altogether. Regardless, France is ripe for our demands...;x

EVENTNAME164165;Henry V is heir to France;x
EVENTHIST164165;Faced with the Anglo-Burgundian alliance and the pressure of Queen Isabel, Charles VI signed a veritable surrender of the Royal government in the Treaty of Troyes. Charles VI disinherited his own son, the so-called King of Bourges, and agreed to recognize Henry V as heir, giving him his daughter Catherine in marriage. For the Lancastrians, the Treaty of Troyes was a triumphant victory which seemed to offer them the Crown of St. Louis for good.;x
ACTIONNAME164165A;Take the Dauphin, and Our Victory Will be complete!;x
#;x
EVENTNAME164166;The Treaty of Orleans;x
EVENTHIST164166;From the negotiations at Troyes emerged a treaty that was eventually signed at Orleans. Henry V, enomoured with Charles' daughter, Katherine, demanded her hand in marriage and the Duchies of Normandy and Guyenne which were to be held by Henry free from liege homage to the King of France. It was in effect a return to Henry's demands before the bulk of HEnry's forces had landed in Normandy, and to what the Armagnacs had promised him years before. Charles Duke of Orleans along with Jean Duke of Bourbon, after spending several years as prisoners in London, were ransomed back to France and lent the treaty their full support. Most importantly, Henry V was to renounce his claim to the throne of France. Charles VI was constrained to agree to Henry's proposal. The English were pacified and the Armagnacs claimed political success. Eager to solidify popular support and capture an air of legitimacy, the Kings of England and France, and the Dukes of Bourbon and Orleans would hold a public ceremony in Paris where each swore an extraordinary oath on behalf of themselves and their blood lines to uphold the treaty stipulations. Henry V formally renounced his claim to the throne of France. The Duke of Burgundy, who had stormed out of the Troyes negotiations, refused to attend the ceremonies. Eager to garner the support of the realm for his decision, Henry V wasted no time calling to session a Parliament that quickly ratified the treaty. Nevertheless, Guyenne was held by the Dauphin and his supporters, and it was clear that Henry V would need a lasting peace with Charles Dauphin of France.;x

EVENTNAME164168;The Dauphin's Refusal;x
EVENTHIST164168;With the Treaty of Orleans, the Duchy of Guyenne was to be handed over to England. However, Charles of Valois, son of Charles VI and heir to his throne, refused to ratify the Treaty and thus his forces and those of the Armagnacs remained garrisoned in the duchy provinces. England would have to enforce the treaty through aggression, as Charles VI was in no condition to bring his rebellious son to tow.;x

EVENTNAME164169;Henry's Generous Legacy;x
EVENTHIST164169;When Henry V returned to England with his new bride, it had seemed that his entire realm had erupted in joyous celebration for their conquering Hero King. However, once the festivities, ceremonies, and initial euphoria of peace and victory began to fade, a grim reality sunk into the hearts and minds of the commons. England had little to show for Henry's miraculous success on the fields of France, save a youthful French Princess and the possessions of Gascogne and Calais, both of which were now mortgaged to the Crown. Disillusioned, many began to view this as an outrage, and it rumours began to circulate widely that the King had abandonded his subjects, nobles and commons alike, at Troyes. Few had escaped many of the great sacrifices at home, and fewer still had reaped the spoils and plunder of victory in the fields of France. The lucrative attractions of the chevauchee and levying the patis were now gone, leaving many returning soldiers frustrated and unemployed. There were no more fortunes to be made in France by the landed gentry and lessor nobles, as any potentially lucrative positions of adminsitration fell to the greatest ascendant nobles and those who enjoyed the King's favour. Many Lords were now seeking payments for their terms of indenture, as were their own men, whilst the Commons now attempted to persuade the King to Resume Crown lands for fear of further taxation. Preferring to spend his time with his new bride and enjoying this relative time of peace, Henry V had neither the time nor the inclination to attend to these matters of redress. Nevertheless, upon his death, and with an infant King on the throne, the support of Parliament became crucial to legitimize the Regency. The ensuing Parliamentary sessions were strained and the Council was reluctant, if not outright opposed, to agree to Resumption. The sessions were twice prorogued for weeks due to rioting in London and Kent, which were brutally put down. It was the first real test for a fragile Regency...;x

EVENTNAME164170;Nivernais is Granted to Burgundy;x
EVENTHIST164170;English policy in the heart of France was to leave the Duke of Burgundy, who had the most influence in the region, as the de facto ruler. The Regency of Henry VI would now confirm his status, officially legitimizing the status quo. The English still required the Duke's support in order to preserve the Treaty of Troyes, and confirming Burgundy's role in this new era was believed to be a necessary step to preserve the Anglo-Burgundian alliance.;x

EVENTHIST164171;On October 21, 1422, King Charles VI of France died in complete isolation. In accordance with the Treaty of Troyes, Charlse VI's son, Charles does not inherit the throne. Instead it is Henry V's son, the infant Henry VI, who inherits the Crown of St. Louis. Charles, residing south of the Loire, would be declared a bastard and unfit for the Crown of France. The English commanders in France led by Henry V's brother, the Duke of Bedford, now concerned themselves with consolidating their positions north of the Loire. The territories south and east of Paris were hostile to the foreign government now ruling from Paris and Rouen. The rebels would need to be put down in an effort to subjugate the population.;x

#;x
EVENTNAME164172;Uncertainty in England;x
EVENTHIST164172;In the months following the Treaty of Orleans, and the Dauphin's subsequent adherence to its stipulations, England's Lords and Commons had grown increasingly restless. During the remainder of his reign, Henry V declined to call Parliament. After Henry's death and once the Regency had been established, a Parliament was finally called in order to address England's misgivings. The mood of the proceedings was mixed. The war in France had been costly. Retainers, households, troops and loans had to be paid. England's lords had found themselves hard pressed for repayment of Crown debts. The Lords understood that only the greatest among them, and even then only those select few enjoying the King's favour, would profit greatly from England's newly acquired possessions in France. In contrast to the discontent of the nobles, the Commons were emboldened and enthusiastic. The populace had endured harsh taxation throughout the long war with France, and most desired an end to the burden. Having bitterly fought for an Act of Resumption ever since Henry IV's days, the Commons now looked on the latest political development as a golden opportunity to push further still. The Council was in a difficult position and was hard pressed to come to a concensus and make a decision. The Commons expected the King to pay for the defense of England's continental possessions out of his newly acquired possessions in France, while the nobles coveted the nwe lucrative positions on the continent, and were demanding payment for services rendered. For the meantime, stability in France was threatening stability in England.;x

EVENTNAME164173;Proposal at Amiens;x
EVENTHIST164173;After the death of Charles VI, the infant son of Henry V had inherited the crown of France in accordance with the Treaty of Troyes. This treaty, with Burgndian aid, had granted the English command of the administration of France. However, the majority of France remained largely out of English hands. The English Council were treaty bound to undertake the enormous task of conquering the remnants of France. Thus, John of Lancaster, Duke of Bedford and now Regent of France continued to seek the aid of Duke Philip of Burgundy 'the good' and so approached Philip and John VI, Duke of Brittany with an alliance proposal. Specifically, Bedford proposed a marriage alliance to reafirm their treaty commitments and so Philip offered his sisters, Anne and Margaret as brides for Bedford and Arthur of Brittany, Earl of Richmond. How shall Bedford proceed?;x
ACTIONNAME164173A;Vigorously persue this development!;x
ACTIONNAME164173B;We needn't bother with Burgundian aid!;x
#;x
EVENTNAME164174;Treaty of Amiens, 1423;x
EVENTHIST164174;After some deliberation, Philip, Duke of Burgundy and John VI, Duke of Brittany agreed to Bedford's proposal. Within weeks of the treaty, Bedford was married to Anne of Burgundy while Arthur of Brittany, Earl of Richmond married Margaret of Burgundy. Perhaps more importantly, Burgundy and Brittany reaffirmed their commitments to the Treaty of Troyes, acknowledging Bedford as Regent of France. Thus the alliance between England, Burgundy and Brittany was reafirmed. Nevertheless, the stability as such was questionable, and neither leader trusted the other entirely. At the very least, Bedford was now free to persue the conquest of France without interference from Burgundy or Brittany. In England the Treaty of Amiens was celebrated as a token of Bedford's ability as Regent of France. Well done!;x
#;x
EVENTNAME164175;Rejection at Amiens;x
EVENTHIST164175;At Amiens, Bedford had approached Philip and John VI with a proposal for an alliance between the three dukes. At Amiens, Bedford had proposed a marriage alliance and so Philip offered his sisters Anne and Margaret to Bedford and Arthur of Brittany, Earl of Richmond, respectively. However, after some deliberation, the French dukes reversed their dispositions and rejected Bedford's proposal. Philip's refusal dealt a significant blow to the legitamacy of England's rule in France.;x

EVENTNAME164177;Bedford is Granted the Duchy Lands of Anjou;x
EVENTHIST164177;The Treaty of Troyes bound the English to subdue the lands held by the Dauphin and his supporters. Though the Treaty guaranteed a status quo for those who swore allegiance to the King of England, any who refused had, by the same stipulation, commited treason. Thus, the lands, titles and possessions of the traitors, indeed their very lives snd livelihood, were now forfeit. Their material wealth was to be seized and resumed to the Crown, whom was free to distribute such wealth as they saw fit. In late spring of 1424, by letters pattent issued in the infant King Henry VI's name, John Duke Bedford and Regent of France was given King Rene I's lands in France, along with the Duchy of Alencon. The Duchy of Anjou was to become a formal possession of the Crown of France. Such a move was just as political and militant, as it was legal. The English were preparing to subdue French resistance in the counties of Maine and Anjou.;x

EVENTNAME164178;Burgundy is Rewarded;x
EVENTHIST164178;The treaty of Troyes not only made Henry V successor of Charles VI, it confirmed him both as the sovereign lord and as the ally of Philip, Duke of Burgundy which meant, in practical terms, that Philip was staking his own great authority, both as lord and as leader of a political faction in France, behind the treaty. Such support was of incalculable value to the English. It meant that, where necessary, ducal pressure could be brought to bear upon individuals and corporations to accept the treaty's terms, and when Henry V died, it led to a more rapid and more general acceptance of his young son in Burgundian-controlled lands than might otherwise have been achieved. Such support would prove costly. The Burgundians were at pains to ensure payments were timely and in no short supply. No small wonder, then, that Philip was given several counties surrounding the County of Burgundy, and retained de facto control over the vast counties of Champagne and Nivernais.;x

EVENTHIST164179;During the English siege of the city of Orleans, the inhabitants of Orleans offered to surrender peacefully, provided Orleans would fall to the jurisdiction of the Duke of Burgundy, rather than Bedford. Not long before, Charles had made a deal with Philip Duke of Burgundy promising Orleans to the Duke in exchange for his ceasing of hostilities towards the Dauphinists. Henry VI's Regent in France, Bedford, taken aback by this development, reacted harshly and rebutted what he considered to be an outrageous insult. Needless to say, the Duke of Burgundy became infuriated, abandoning Bedford's forces altogether. The relations between the two were deeply hurt, but the notion that such a hard fought province would fall to Burgundy was simply too incredible to consider seriously.;x

EVENTHIST164180;Despite the Treaty of Troyes, nothing was gained for England as long as they were resisted in the south by the Dauphin Charles and his Armagnac entourage. The Treaty bound England to destroy the Dauphin and recover any and all of the lands in his possession. Now, most of these lands were surrendering voluntarily to English forces. The Dauphin's son, Louis, would be hard pressed to maintain unity around him. Nevertheless, Louis could be utilized by any one of Henry VI's enemies, thus it would be best if Louis was removed entirely from the political scene. The Dauphinists must be eliminated, and the senior Valois line extinguished. The Treaty of Troyes demanded nothing less.;x

To make matters worse, Burgundy seemed to be putting forth a lackluster effort towards pacifying the rebels in the south. Though Bedford wished to solidify the Lancastrian hold on Maine and Anjou, the Earl of Salisbury demanded firmer action and fervant prosecution of the war against the Dauphin. Bedford reluctantly agreed to send Salisbury to take the Loire Valley and eventually Orleans, the heavily fortified town and home of the Duke of Orleans. There were those besides Bedford who disliked the plan, as attacking the lands of a captive was widely considered a dishonourable act. The Duke of Orleans was a captive in London and had been since Agincourt. Nevertheless, the treaty of Troyes was firmly on the side of those who wished to press onwards...;x

However, they allowed the heir to the throne to finally secure a Burgundian alliance, and to form a united front against the King of England. As for himself, John the Fearless took a principal place in the government of the Kingdom.;x

EVENTHIST170287;In the Agreement of Montereau John the Fearless accepted the recognition of Charles as the true Dauphin of France, he pushed the Valois into the pocket of the Burgundian Party, the only guarantee to the Crown. The Duke was in position to ask anything and everything. Burgundy considered this the perfect occasion to escape from the sovereignty of France by demanding from the Valois the renunciation of ordinary homage from the Duke and his line for Artois, Picardy, Champagne, Nivernais and Burgundy. Upon Charles VII ascension, the Duke of Burgundy sought to implement the stipulations of the Agreement at Montereau;x

EVENTHIST170288;On May 21, 1420, faced with the Anglo-Burgundian alliance and Parisian agitation, Charles VI was constrained to recognize Henry V as regent and legitimate successor, in effect disinheriting his son, designated the 'so-called Dauphin'. The latter however, did not have any intention to yield and resisted, aided by many barons allied to the Armagnacs. In 1420, no one could give the future Charles VII any chance, at least as long as the alliance between the English and the Burgundians endured.;x

EVENTNAME170290;The Treaty of Orleans;x
EVENTHIST170290;From the negotiations at Troyes emerged a treaty that was eventually signed at Orleans. Henry V, enomoured with Charles' daughter, Katherine, demanded her hand in marriage and the Duchies of Normandy and Guyenne which were to be held by Henry free from liege homage to the King of France. It was in effect a return to Henry's demands before the bulk of Henry's forces had landed in Normandy, and to what the Armagnacs had promised him years before. Charles Duke of Orleans along with Jean Duke of Bourbon, after spending several years as prisoners in London, were ransomed back to France and lent the treaty their full support. Most importantly, Henry V was to renounce his claim to the throne of France. Charles VI was constrained to agree to Henry's proposal. The English were pacified and the Armagnacs claimed political success. Eager to solidify popular support and capture an air of legitimacy, the Kings of England and France, and the Dukes of Bourbon and Orleans would hold a public ceremony in Paris where each swore an extraordinary oath on behalf of themselves and their blood lines to uphold the treaty stipulations. Henry V formally renounced his claim to the throne of France. The Duke of Burgundy, who had stormed out of the Troyes negotiations, refused to attend the ceremonies.;x

EVENTHIST170291;After the triumphal campaign of 1419-1420, nothing more could prevent Henry V from making his rights to France recognised. However, he chose to negotiate a generous peace, contrary with his former declarations. Henry V was prepared to release the Dukes of Orleans and Bourbon. Both of whom, had been held captive in London since Agincourt. Furthermore, Henry V was to wed Katherine Valois, daughter of Charles VI. Lastly, the English would accept a large payment to cover Henry V's costs, his renunciation of the Crown of France, Katherine's dowry, and the ransom for the two Dukes. In the meantime, Burgundy, abandoned by Henry V, could not maintain a hold on either Paris, or Charles VI. The Dauphin, and the principle Armagnac leaders, regained control of Charles VI.;x

EVENTNAME170296;Charles of Orleans Swears Allegiance to Charles VII;x
EVENTHIST170296;Duke Philip of Burgundy's father, John 'the Fearless' had slaughtered the Armagnacs, including their leader, Bernard VI, and in turn had been cut down at Montereau in vengeance. In the aftermath of Montereau, Philip threw his lot in with the English. King Henry V had demanded the Crown of France, and to this effect a treaty recognizing Henry as regent and legitimate successor to Charles VI was drafted and signed at Troyes. Duke John's murder at Montereau had demonstrated to Charles VI that his son was unfit for the throne, a decision that was soon ratified by the Parlement in Paris. Those who refused to swear an oath of allegiance to the new order were now traitors and rebels. The Dauphinists, including the remnants of the Armagnac's, were now rebels in the eyes of the Burgundians and the English usurper, and had retreated south of the Loire shortly before Paris was captured. The Treaty commits England to conquer the lands held by the so-called rebels. Charles VI's remaining forces split along their partisan leanings. Many surrendered, some entered active service for Henry V, while others openly declared themselves for Charles, the 'rebel King of Bourges'. Dauphinist sympathies would stall the English campaign for some time as many strongholds to the south and east of Paris continued to resist the English advance. Nevertheless, the Burgundians commanded the city of Troyes which would facilitate Henry's push to link the Burgundian heartland with his newly acquired French posessions. Despite the early opportunity, the treaty was a serious blow to the sole surviving son of Charles VI and legitimate heir of France. Charles's hesitatation would cost him and his supporters dearly in the early phases of Henry V's renewed conflict...;x

EVENTHIST170299;Symbol of the victory of Orleans, heroine of the Consecration, Joan had achieved the task that was expected of her. Being strong willed, she believed they should push the advantage towards Paris, but suffers one small failure. She remained always active, much to the annoyance of her adversaries at court, pressed to fight, she decided to continue the struggle against the English and the Duke of Burgundy, which went against the policy chosen by Charles VII and his entourage, who thought that the key to victory lay in a union with Philip the Good. Was the Maid, always an object of intrigue and fights for influence, going to become a political obstacle? To remedy this problem, the entourage of the King finally chose a radical solution. To dispatch Joan on a suicidal mission where she knew death or a martyrdom worthy of legend awaited her.;x

Of course there were the threats of a trial for witchcraft, but contrary to the hopes of Bedford, that had hardly any deep consequences. The victory of Charles certainly had much to do with the exploits of the Maid, but her role was at an end. It was the Franco-Burgundian rapprochement, which already was clearly marked at the time of the march to the Consecration, which decided the fate of Hundred Years War.;x

The English accused her of being a witch, and so they put together a trial designed to convict her of sorcery and witchcraft. Nevertheless, the tribunal found her innocent, and released her. Joan's release presented Charles VII with a delicate situation. He could either do without one who had served so much permanently to preserve the chance of an agreement with the Duke of Burgundy, or he could give her a real command for better or worse...;x

Her destiny was achieved, her voices were still, nothing remained but to withdraw, which was done without discussion. As much relieved of this sometimes burdensome presence as desirous to thank her for her essential role, Charles made generous provisions for her and her family. When Joan died, many years later at a convent in the area of Domrémy, the rumours of the miracle which surrounded her led to a rapid canonization, which did nothing but reinforce the prestige of French monarchy.;x

Finally, the military recovery driven by Charles VII and Joan of Arc, as well as the souring of Anglo Burgundian relations brought Philip back to the negotiating table with Charles VII. The current truce between the two would be extended. At issue was the confirmation of Burgundy's landed claims, recognition of Charles VII's right to throne of France, renunciation of any ties to England, and the restoration of Crown lands.;x

Charles VII agreed in the same way not to claim homage from Artois and Flanders, and yielded the majority of the cities of the valley of Somme. An important clause allowed the King of France to purchase back the Somme towns for a heafty sum.

The negotiations had finally settled on Rene I Duke of Anjou's daughter, Margaret. The marriage arrangement prolonged the period of truce between England and France, and for this Suffolk elevated to the rank of Duke. However, Henry had corresponded with King Charles VII and Rene. He had promised Charles to return to Rene the county of Maine. To this end, Suffolk was compliant, and the Queen pushed every chance she had to lobby for her father's sake. Nevertheless, Henry delayed relinquishing the county, however, and Charles's patience was wearing thin. It was now high time for Charles to collect. Henry had delayed relinquishing control of Maine to Charles for several years. Thus, Charles now threatened to take Maine by force and mobilized his armies along Maine's border. Henry had borken the marriage arrangement and was refused to surrender Maine.;x

EVENTHIST170312;The seizure of Fougeres by the English precipitated an invasion by Charles VII that expelled the English from the vast majority of France. The events at Fourges are shrouded in controversy. However, it is known that Francois de Surienne, an aragonese mercenary who had risen to become a Knight of the Garter as well as one of Edmund Beaufort's senior commander's in France, had led the army that had sacked Fougeres. Thus, it was relatively simple for Charles VII to make the connection between the two, despite Somerset's denial of prior knowledge. Moreover, with the Duke of Brittany having sought Charles VII's aid, the French King was anxious to press and exercise his perceived rights of feudal lordship over Brittany, even in their more subtle forms.;x

If her rights on the Duchy of Burgundy and the other patrimonial lands could not be disputed, it was not so with the Crown of France, which could not fall to a woman. Who would finally claim the throne was far from obvious. Duke Philippe had barred the Charles VI's direct heir to the throne, Charles, and had had this confirmed by Parlement in Paris. However, there had been no such extension to Charles's own son, Louis. Thus, Louis stood to inherit the throne of France.

EVENTNAME20005;The War of the Roses in France;x
EVENTHIST20005;The War of the Roses were as much about the crown of France as they were about that of England, so it should come as no surprise that much of the most vicious fighting was in the larger of the two Kingdoms. Both the Lancastrians and the Yorkists saw France as an important battleground and recruitment centre. The situation was further complicated by attempts by some members of the French nobility to restore the House of Valois to the French throne.;x

EVENTHIST20008;Though England had triumphed in the Hundred Years' War, French resistance continued under the surface. Now, the state of France has been reborn, and a new King of France has been crowned. Those French who remain under English rule are becoming increasingly restless, and no longer recognize the claims of England to the lands of France. English rule in the French provinces has been dealt a staggering blow.;x
#;x
EVENTNAME20009;The Wars of Religion in the French Provinces;x
EVENTHIST20009;By the early 1560s, the simmering religious unrest in the French provinces had exploded into open rivalry and conflict. Various factions maneouvred for power and numerous massacres were commented on all sides. There were the Ultra-Catholics, generally based in the centre and northeast of France, and the Reformed Huguenots, generally based in the south, with the moderate Catholics and Protestants stuck in between these two extremes. All factions desired the support and aid of the English government to achieve their religious aims. England could not remain neutral. A choice had to be made. However, the faction England chooses to support may not be popular with the English people or nobility themselves. Also, there was the always present danger that if the factional and religious fighting got out of hand, England's ability to rule its French provinces might be forever damaged.;x

On the 24th a three-day massacre of Huguenots began in Paris, and soon spread to nearby Catholic towns. The surviving Huguenot leaders redoubled their efforts to oppose the Ultra-Catholics, and their resistance increased accordingly.;x

EVENTHIST20014;By the early 1580s, the Ultra-Catholics in the French provinces were increasingly concerned about their position and power, and questioned the continuing ability of the English government to treat them in the way they felt proper. Not surprisingly, foreign Catholic powers were more than willing to support the French Ultra-Catholics, and indirectly undermine English control over their wealthy French provinces.;x

#;x

EVENTHIST20024;By 1590, the various religious factions within the French provinces have fought themselves to the point of exhaustion. The situation calms across the Channel, as neither side has the will or ability to dominate the other.

The Kingdoms of England and France are united under one crown, and the time has come to sort out matters of the state. The lands of Bourgogne, Picardie, and Artois are rightful lands of the English crown, and as such the Duke of Burgundy is subject to our rule. We now have a choice.

#;x
EVENTNAME_RANDOM046;Noble Families Feud;x
EVENTHIST_RANDOM046;Violence among leading families within a state was never far from the surface. Often, this instability would boil over into open confilict. The result was less than a full blown civil war but could immensely disturb the stability of a state.;x

#;x
EVENTNAME_RANDOM048;Assassination of Noble;x
EVENTHIST_RANDOM048;Noble families were the bulwark of power during these times. Assassination of a powerful house leader was seen as a critical blow to those families' fortunes. With the rise of religious strife, assassinations of rival religion's nobles became increasingly common.;x
#;x
EVENTNAME_RANDOM049;Cessation of Church Functions to Nobility;x
EVENTHIST_RANDOM049;Noble families were often granted control over church lands and appointment in many states in exchange for cash contributions to the crown's efforts. The crown, of course, lost control over some revenues this way in exhange for a short term boost in revenue.;x
ACTIONNAME_RANDOM049A;Decline;x
ACTIONNAME_RANDOM049B;Accept;x
#;x
EVENTNAME_RANDOM050;Sale of Offices;x

#;x
EVENTNAME_RANDOM054;New Land Claimed;x

#;x
EVENTNAME_RANDOM055;Establish Cantonments;x
EVENTHIST_RANDOM055;The establishment of permanent recruiting areas for the armies of the age made it easier to extract men from the population to serve in the army.;x
#;x
EVENTNAME_RANDOM056;Nobles Demand Old Rights;x

ACTIONNAME_RANDOM056A;Reject Demands;x
ACTIONNAME_RANDOM056B;Accept Demands;x
#;x
EVENTNAME_RANDOM057;Cities Demand Old Rights;x
EVENTHIST_RANDOM057;Urban dwellers had always existed under a different code of rules than their rural brethren - even in the same state. Just as monarchs looked to curb the privileges of nobles they often tried to bring cities under more uniform rules and regulations. The cities often resisted these efforts.;x
ACTIONNAME_RANDOM057A;Deny Old Rights;x
ACTIONNAME_RANDOM057B;Accept;x
#;x
EVENTNAME_RANDOM058;Non-enforcement of Ordinances;x
EVENTHIST_RANDOM058;Monarchs ruled by issuing ordinances but they were almost powerless to enforce them. Enforcement depended upon the local powers (nobles/city governments) who would not always be as vigilant as the monarchs would have desired.;x

EVENTNAME_RANDOM059;Bourgeoisie Request Privileges;x
EVENTHIST_RANDOM059;The Bourgeoisie class grew increasing resentful of the power of the noble families and particularly their lack of opportunities in the higher ranks of government.

EVENTNAME_RANDOM061;Foreign Drill Instructor Available;x

EVENTNAME_RANDOM062;Build a Great Palace;x
EVENTHIST_RANDOM062;Monarchs struggles with ways to subdue the nobility. The rise of firearms reduced the nobles' role as warriors but left them with in the eyes of the monarchs too much idle time. Some monarchs created great new palaces with elaborate court rituals to dazzle the nobles and keep them occupied. Versailles is the greatest expression of this movement.;x

ACTIONNAME_RANDOM062B;Build the Palace;x

EVENTNAME_RANDOM063;Indulgence peddler in our domain;x
EVENTHIST_RANDOM063;Indulgences were essentially a pre-pay system for our sins. A devotee could buy forgiveness before they committed sins. This practice was widely practiced and its abuse was one of the prompts for Luther's movement. Indulgence peddlers were very apt at extracting large amounts of cash from any area they passed through.;x
#;x
EVENTNAME_RANDOM064;Uncooperative Philosopher;x
EVENTHIST_RANDOM064;Many times men of ideas would posit ideas that ran counter to accept doctrine either from the monarch or the church. The state would normally try to get the thinker to recant his ideas and, failing that, would resort to imprisonment or execution. Men like Giordono Bruno, Thomas Moore and Galileo are classic examples of troublesome thinkers.;x

ACTIONNAME_RANDOM064B;Allow to Remain Free;x

EVENTNAME_RANDOM065;Regional Heresy;x
EVENTHIST_RANDOM065;Small bouts of heretical ideas would spring up from time to time.

EVENTNAME_RANDOM066;Boundary Dispute;x

ACTIONNAME_RANDOM066B;Settle Issue;x
#;x
EVENTNAME_RANDOM067;Merchants Harassed;x
EVENTHIST_RANDOM067;Disputes over the treatment of local merchants were not uncommon. All governments faced minor reports of unfair treatment and harassment of their merchants.

EVENTNAME_RANDOM068;Regional Population Boom;x

EVENTNAME_RANDOM069;Great Noble Family Requests Aid;x
EVENTHIST_RANDOM069;The most powerful of the noble families in the state often had vast wealth but that did not stop them like their monarchs from getting into financial troubles.

EVENTNAME_RANDOM070;Support for Dissidents Abroad;x
EVENTHIST_RANDOM070;Monarchs were contacted by a variety of dissidents from other states. These dissidents claimed to have vast supporters who just needed some cash - they were usually lying. Despite this, their claims excited many influential people at the court - particularly when religion entered the mix. Supporting these dissidents rarely accomplished anything other than antagonizing the other state but failure to support could create a bad impression at home.;x

EVENTNAME_RANDOM071;Foreign Trade Competition Rises;x

EVENTNAME_RANDOM072;Exceptional Court Painter Available;x
EVENTHIST_RANDOM072;Courts were often looking for painters and artists to try to adequately capture the glory of the monarch.

EVENTNAME_RANDOM080;Great royal hunt;x
EVENTHIST_RANDOM080;From time to time most rulers liked to arrange great royal hunts. These occasions were quite popular, but far from everyone were invited to participate - being invited to a royal hunt was a clear indication of favour. As with similar occasions, this was used by the King to diplomatically demonstrate his current favorites among the nobility as well as the foreign dignitaries.;x

EVENTNAME_RANDOM085;Monastic Clashes;x
EVENTHIST_RANDOM085;Though Hinduism is diverse and encompasses several coexisting religious traditions, peace is not always the norm.

EVENTNAME_RANDOM093;Enforcement of Jizya;x
EVENTHIST_RANDOM093;Islam in South Asia often dropped or did not enforce the imposition of Jizya, a tax on Zimmis, non-believers who are protected by the state. Instead, in order to smooth relations with the dominantly Hindu populations, they classified them as Musta'min, protected non-Muslims exempt from Jizya. In history, however, there was always a movement from conservative factions to impose Jizya. Imposing it would bring revolts, and refusing to do so would build trust with the Hindu community, while losing it with elements of the Islamic elite.;x

EVENTNAME_RANDOM110;A Great Puja;x
EVENTHIST_RANDOM110;In Hinduism, the King's duty to his people was a very serious charge. To show the King's control over the state and to show piousness, the King might throw an expensive religious ceremony, a Royal Puja. These were thrown on auspicious days as advised by astrologers and holy men. To not hold such an event on a recomended day would be seen poorly.;x

EVENTHIST155001;In 1415 Ethiopian Emperor Yeshaq had finally destroyed the sultanate of Ifat, that with the help of the Afar Muslims had raised in rebellion against his father. The Walashma sultan Saad ad-Din II of Ifat was pursued and cornered at the important trading port of Saylac. Yeshaq conquered the city and killed the sultan, but his family crossed the sea and took refuge in Yemen. The sons of Saad, returned a few years later, taking the name of sultans of Adal, since Ifat was now under Christian hands. Sabr, Mansur and Jamal were soon killed in fights against Ethiopia or between Muslims. It was then up to the young Shihab Badlay to avenge his father. Since Saylac had been sacked several times, he moved the capital to Dakkar, near Hargeisa. He then conquered the province of Bale, and twice invaded Ethiopia in three years trying to conquer the Muslim state of Dawaro, gaining the nickname of Arwe (the beast). However, at the battle of Gomit, in 1445, he was defeated by emperor Zara Yaqob, killed and dismembered.;x

EVENTHIST155002;Despite its dynastic troubles, Adal was becoming rich through slave-trade at the port of Saylac. Increased power meant also increased needs, and a new base was created at Harar, near the border of the Great Rift, within easy reach of the Christian Northern Highlands and the Afar Delta to raid for slaves. This military base created by then candidate Abu Bakr in 1520, soon expanded, and when finally Abu Bakr rose to power in 1525, he decided to move his capital to Harar. Although it constituted a superb place to launch attacks on Ethiopia, it was a strategic mistake, because it further removed Adal from its real source of wealth, Saylac.;x

EVENTNAME155003;Diraasal-Islaam;x
EVENTHIST155003;At the turn of the XVI century Adal was submerged in chaos. Since Ethiopia was strong under a succession of capable rulers, the Sultan of Adal, Muhammad II tried to maintain peace. At the same time, an Imam, Mahfuz, ruler of the port of Saylac started to pursue a rigorous Islamic conduct, including Jihad against the Christians. In control of the port, he was buying flintstock musquets from Ottoman merchants, and conducting succesful raids into Ethiopia to pay for them in loot and slaves. When Muhammad and Mahfuz went together to raid Ethiopia in 1517, the Ethiopian emperor ambushed them. The sultan escaped, but Mahfuz was killed. However the sultan was murdered the next year plunging Adal into a civil war. Under these circumstances, a man emerged that would turn Adal from an obscure sultanate into ''Diraasal-Islaam'', a powerful nation renowed by her virtue and Muslim rigor. He was Ahmad ibn Ibrihim al-Ghazi, known as Sahib al-Fath (the Conqueror). His rise to fame started with his marriage with Mahfuz's daughter, atracting to him his powerful party and giving him control of the port of Saylac. He also married his sister to Mattan ibn Uthman, a great Somali commander that would play an important role in his battles. That way he also added a sizeable Somali army to his forces. He then got the support of the Ottomans, who had grown suspicious of the contacts between Ethiopians and Portuguese. It was easy for him then to kill Sultan Abu Bakr and install his brother Umar Din as a puppet. He was ready to take on Ethiopia.;x

EVENTNAME155004;Jihad;x
EVENTHIST155004;After seizing power, Ahmad ibn Ibrihim al-Ghazi decided to launch a Jihad against Christian Ethiopia. Adal was a much smaller country, and with far less resources, but this did not stop Ahmad, who had a plan. Besides uniting Muslims from Adal, Ethiopia, Somalia and Afar under his banner, he created an elite corps drilled according to Ottoman standards, and armed with very expensive flintlock arquebuses imported through Saylac. The Ottomans offered their support for a price. The critical moment came when Adal had to pay the annual tribute to Ethiopia imposed after a previous lost war. Under his orders, the sultan refused to pay, and Ahmad destroyed the punitive expedition sent by Ethiopia. Ahmad had started the fire of the Jihad, but to feed it, he started consuming both countries. To finance the overtaxing war, Ahmad transformed Saylac into the biggest slave market in Africa. Over the years, hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of slaves from Ethiopia and Adal, both Christians and Muslims were sold to pay armies and buy arms and munitions. Allah demanded such sacrifice and both countries were ravaged and depopulated. Portuguese accounts speak of the huge sale of Ethiopian slaves Christian and Muslims from Egypt to India in those decades. The Indian princes became very found of Ethiopian slaves as they made very good soldiers, and entire armies of slaves were purchased in Gujarat. Before starting this Jihad, we must eradicate the Christians before the effects of the war consume our country, or we will pay a hefty price.;x

EVENTHIST155005;After invading Ethiopia, Ahmad met the army of the Ethiopian Emperor Lebna Dengel or Dawit IV at the Awash river in the battle of Shimbra Kure in 1529. Lebna Dengel had 16,000 cavalry and 200,000 infantry against Ahmad 560 cavalry and 12,000 soldiers. Although the Ethiopians were able to kill 5,000 soldiers of Adal, their loses were much higher. Afterwards Ahmad penetrated deep into the highlands, attacking Dawaro and Shewa in 1531, then Amhara, Lasta, Bale, Hadya, Sidama and the Gurage. With half of former Ethiopia under his control, in 1535 Ahmad invaded Tigray in the North, sacking the sacred city of Aksum and destroying the Cathedral were the emperors had been crowned for centuries. But the worst part was the damage inflicted to the people of Ethiopia and Adal by Ahmad, that would change their demography forever. To finance his military campaign against his bigger neighbour, Ahmad used a scorched earth tactic, laying waste to the land and selling every Ethiopian he could capture, Muslim or Christian, as a slave. No Christian priest or nun was left alive by him. Lebna Dengel, outmanoeuvred and out-musketed, fled from one province to another, trying to organize the resistance. There was no possibility of a peace agreement, as Ahmad was bent on the destruction of the Christian country. His elder son, Fiqtor, was killed in battle, and the youngest, Menas, was captured and sent as a slave to the Ottoman overlord of Yemen. In desperation, Lebna Dengel sent a plee for help to the King of Portugal. In doing that, he saved his country, but he would no see the result, as he died on the run, exhausted and miserable in 1540.;x

EVENTNAME155006;A last attempt;x
EVENTHIST155006;When the Portuguese arrived to help Ethiopia, Ahmad was about to win the entire Kingdom, with the emperor in hiding and the Ethiopians accepting his supremacy. The King of Portugal had sent Cristovão da Gama, son of famous explorer Vasco da Gama, with 400 soldiers and 1000 arquebuses, plus some small cannons. Surprised, Ahmad was defeated three times, but he had a last card to play. He offered his vassalage to the Ottoman bey of Yemen, Zebid Pasha, in exchange for help. He was granted 900 Turkish soldiers and additional arms, and at the battle of Wofla, on August 28, 1542, the Portuguese were defeated, and Cristovão was captured, tortured and beheaded. Believing the Portuguese destroyed, Ahmed dismissed 600 of the Ottomans to other duties, but was then confronted by the remaining Portuguese and the army of Gelawdewos, rearmed with the stored weapons. The battle of Wayna-Daga on February 21, 1543, was initially indecisive, but the Portuguese had sworn to avenge their leader, and singling out Ahmad, killed him. His army fell in confusion and was completely destroyed. The remaining of the forces of Adal abandoned Ethiopia and fell back to Harar. The war continued, now favorable to Ethiopia, and Bale was lost. Afars and Somalies abandoned the war, leaving exhausted Adal almost an empty shell. Ahmad's widow, Del Wambara, offered herself to Ahmad's nephew, Nur ibn Mujtahid, on the condition of continuing the fight. Nur reinforced his base, by walling the city of Harar with the famous Jugol, to prevent another sacking, and in 1556 he launched a two front coordinated attack with Ottoman help. The Ottomans, leaded by Ozdemur Pasha, conquered Massawa, the best port of the Red Sea, and the only one the Ethiopians had, but their attempt to reach the highlands failed against the determined Ethiopian resistance. The attack by Nur was an even worse failure, taking the life of the last of the Walashma sultans of Adal, Barakat. The death of Ethiopian Emperor Gelawdewos at the walls of Harar did not compensate the last failure of Adal. The survival of Ethiopia meant the death of Adal. Nur took over the crown of Adal, but his authority didn't extend far beyond the walls of Harar, and things were about to get much worse.;x

EVENTNAME155007;The end of Adal;x
EVENTHIST155007;By 1567, when Nur died of pestilence, the sultanate of Adal had been reduced to the city of Harar and the Oromo had cut the vital connection to the ports of Saylac and Barbera. What had been Adal disintegrated, part falling under control of Somalies, and most becoming Oromo lands. The Ottomans took control of the Red Sea ports as payment for their help. Meanwhile Harar was consumed by internal instability, and coups and counter-coups were responsible for the short rule of Harar Emirs. In 1575, Emir Muhammad IV made the mistake of joining the rebellion of the governor of a Muslim province in the North East of Ethiopia. He was captured and executed by Emperor Sarsa Dengel, and this defeat saw the end of Adal's last army. In 1577, the emir transferred the sultanate to the Aussa oasis in the Danakil depression. This desert below sea-level was located in no-mans land between the Afars, the Ottomans at Massawa and the Ethiopians. By moving to one of the nastiest places in Africa the sultanate prolonged its nominal existence until it was overrun by Afars and Oromo in 1672. The city of Harar, remained viable behind its walls, independent from the sultanate since 1647, as a city-state. It always has been Muslim, and today is considered the fourth sacred city of Islam. For all practical purposes, 1577 saw the end of Adal as a state. In the long chain of mistakes, one had to be the last.;x

EVENTHIST103013;Since the reign of Usun Hasan, the Ak Koyunlu and Safavids were tied together by close family ties. Originally a religious order, under the tenure of Sheikh Junaid, the Safaviyeh order had begun to acquire temporal power. Exiled from his base of operations in Ardabil by Kara Koyunlu Jahan Shah, Junaid sought refuge in the court of Usun Hasan. As testament to their friendship and Junaid's temporal importance, Usun Hasan gave away his sister, Khadija Begum, in marriage. Likewise, Junaid's son, Haidar, would go on to marry a daughter of Usun Hasan. By the reign of Yaqub, Haidar's military and political strength had grown to such heights that Yaqub had begun to fear the power of his brother-in-law. In 1488, Haidar obtained the permission from the Shirvanshah to march through his territories to make war on the Circassians. However, Haidar turned to attack the capital of Shirvan to avenge the death of his father, Junaid, who was killed in 1460 at the behest of the Shirvanshah. The ruler of Shirvan wrote to Yaqub begging him for assistance.

With his own independent base of supporters and connections to the ruling Ak Koyunlu dynasty, through his mother and wife, he had a strong claim to the throne. Concerned about his nominal vassal's sudden territory gains, Yaqub summoned Haidar to meet him in Tabriz where he intended to public rebuke him for taking Shirvan. Warned of the Sultan's intentions, Haidar rallied his supporters and marched on the Sultan's caravan as it made it's way to the capital. Upon capturing Yaqub, Haidar had him blinded and deposed, citing the Sultan's indifference for warfare as unfitting for the ruler of a burgeoning empire. The next day, Haidar had the khutbah read in his name, as he stylized himself Sultan Haidar. Although not thrilled his coup détat, the majority of Ak Koyunlu tribes were won over by his show of might. The turkmen tribes were now in the hands of the Safavids.;x

EVENTNAME107002;Tay Son Uprising;x
EVENTHIST107002;The Tay Son Rebellion (1771-1802), which ended the Le and Trinh dynasties, was led by three brothers from the village of Tay Son in Binh Dinh Province. The brothers, who were of the Ho clan (to which Ho Quy Ly had belonged), adopted the name Nguyen. The eldest brother, Nguyen Nhac, began an attack on the ruling Nguyen family by capturing Quang Nam and Binh Dinh provinces in 1772. The chief principle and main slogan of the Tay Son was seize the property of the rich and distribute it to the poor. In each village the Tay Son controlled, oppressive landlords and scholar-officials were punished and their property redistributed. The Tay Son also abolished taxes, burned the tax and land registers, freed prisoners from local jails, and distributed the food from storehouses to the hungry. As the rebellion gathered momentum, it gained the support of army deserters, merchants, scholars, local officials, and bonzes.;x

EVENTNAME107003;Nguyen Anh;x
EVENTHIST107003;In 1773 Nguyen Nhac seized Qui Nhon, which became the Tay Son capital. By 1778 the Tay Son had effective control over the southern part of the country, including Gia Dinh (later Saigon). The ruling Nguyen family were all killed by the Tay Son rebels, with the exception of Nguyen Anh, the sixteen-year-old nephew of the last Nguyen lord, who escaped to the Mekong Delta. There he was able to gather a body of supporters and retake Gia Dinh. The city changed hands several times until 1783, when the Tay Son brothers destroyed Nguyen Anh's fleet and drove him to take refuge on Phu Quoc Island. Soon thereafter, he met with French missionary bishop Pigneau de Behaine and asked him to be his emissary in obtaining French support to defeat the Tay Son. Pigneau de Behaine took Nguyen Anh's five-year-old son, Prince Canh, and departed for Pondichery in French India to plead for support for the restoration of the Nguyen. Finding none there, he went to Paris in 1786 to lobby on Nguyen Anh's behalf. Louis XVI ostensibly agreed to provide four ships, 1,650 men, and supplies in exchange for Nguyen Anh's promise to cede to France the port of Tourane (Da Nang) and the island of Poulo Condore. However, the local French authorities in India, under secret orders from the King, refused to supply the promised ships and men. Determined to see French military intervention in Vietnam, Pigneau de Behaine himself raised funds for two ships and supplies from among the French merchant community in India, hired deserters from the French navy to man them, and sailed back to Vietnam in 1789. When Pigneau de Behaine returned to Vietnam in 1789, Nguyen Anh was in control of Gia Dinh. In the succeeding years, the bishop brought Nguyen Anh a steady flow of ships, arms, and European advisers, who supervised the building of forts, shipyards, cannon foundries and bomb factories, and instructed the Vietnamese in the manufacture and use of modern armaments.;x

EVENTNAME107004;Birth of Vietnam;x
EVENTHIST107004;Nguyen's cause was also greatly aided by divisions within the Tay Son leadership, following the death of Quang Trung, and the inability of the new leaders to deal with the problems of famine and natural disasters that wracked the war-torn country. After a steady assault on the north, Nguyen Anh's forces took Phu Xuan in June 1801 and Thang Long a year later. In June 1802, Nguyen Anh adopted the reign name Gia Long to express the unifying of the country--Gia from Gia Dinh (Saigon) and Long from Thang Long (Hanoi). As a symbol of this unity, Gia Long changed the name of the country from Dai Viet to Nam Viet. For the Chinese, however, this was too reminiscent of the wayward General Trieu Da. In conferring investiture on the new government, the Chinese inverted the name to Viet Nam, the first use of that name for the country. Acting as a typical counterrevolutionary government, the Gia Long regime harshly suppressed any forces opposing it or the interests of the bureaucracy and the landowners.;x

EVENTNAME107005;Building Two Great Walls;x
EVENTHIST107005;At the beginning of the 16th century, a lot of divisions occured in vietnamese governement, and some local feudal lords decided to take matters into their own hands. In the north, the exhausted Le dynasty had been overthrown by the governor of Hanoi, Mac Dang Dung which was succeeded later by the Trinh lords as 'protector' of Le Kings. And in the south, another feudal lord, Nguyen Kirn, had set up a Vietnamese government-in-exile in Laos, built around a descendant of the Le. When Nguyen Kirn died in 1545, murdered by supporters of the Mac clan, the struggle degenerated into a long civil war that lasted almost two centuries. In this indecisive struggle, the south remained largely on the defensive. In 1631, in order to repulse invading Trinh forces, the Nguyen completed the building of two huge walls of six meters high and eighteen kilometers long across the Vietnamese plain of Quang-Tri near its narrow waist at Dong-Hoi. The country remained divided on that line for 150 years.;x

EVENTHIST7112;The Council held in Constance from 1414 to 1418 brought an end to the Great Schism, declared its superiority over the Papacy, deposed two of the claimants popes (Gregorius XII elected in Rome and supported by Bayern, Naples, Hungary and Venice and Benedictus XIII elected in Avignon and supported by France, Castile, Aragon and Scotland) and pressed to abdicate the third (Johannes XXIII elected in the council of Pisa) and eventually chose a new pontiff, Martinus V. In spite of what had been decreed by the council of Constance, Benedictus XIII, Pedro de Luna, although deposed, continued to proclaim himself as the only legitimate Pope elected in Avignon. He also declared that the election of a new Pope to end the Great Schism could have been made according to his personal decision only and that he certainly would have confirmed himself as the new pontiff. Abandoned by his main supporters, the Kings of Aragon, Castile and Scotland amongst them, and due to his obstinacy Benedictus XIII preferred to retire in the fortress of Peñiscola near Valencia where he died in 1423. Stirred up by Alfons V hostile to Martinus V in the succession of Naples, the cardinals still faithful to the last Antipope elected a new successor, Clemens VIII, but that new Pope had authority only in Aragon and in 1429 he decided to submit to the Roman pontiff. His submission definitely put an end to the Great Schism of the Western Church.;x

EVENTNAME7131;La Busca i la Biga;x
EVENTHIST7131;One of the ever-present realities during the reign of Alfons V was the confrontation between the King, supported by the popular factions, and the oligarchy. This resulted in tumultuous parlamentary sessions during his reign. The situation was especially critical in Barcelona, where the municipal power (the 'Consell de Cent' which had great influence throughout the Kingdom) was in the hands of the oligarchic faction, called 'La Biga', formed by the wealthy urban patricians. Its power was opposed by the popular faction, called 'La Busca', supported by the King and formed by middle-class merchants and artisans. In 1453, the lieutenant of the King, Galceran de Requesens, removed the municipal power from 'La Biga' and gave it to 'La Busca'. The political situation was stressed nearly to the point of no-return.;x

By 1450 there had already been various problems between father and son, which led the King, in 1456, to dispossess his son of his inheritance. But Carles won some support in Sicily and among the members of the Parliament, and the King imprisoned him in Barcelona in 1460. The Corts held in Lleida in the same year, dominated by the oligarchy, who opposed the King and supported the prince Carles, entrusted the Generalitat (permanent delegation of the Corts) the raising of an army in order to eventually fight the King in case he didn't accept their reivindications.;x

The relation with the Corts became more difficult than ever as the Queen worked hard to restablish royalist power. The Corts and the Generalitat, afraid of possible reprisals against them for the previous events, began a persecution of royalist supporters and raised an army, with which they besieged the city of Girona, where the Queen and her son were at that very moment.

The war lasted for three years and crippled the whole country until Jean finally submitted in the Peace of Tarbes on September 7th 1497. However, the Vicomtes of Narbonne never really gave up their claim and Jean's son Gaston continued to gather support for it. When Gaston died in battle in 1512, Fernando of Aragon who had married Gaston's sister Germaine inherited the claim.

In 1438, René of Anjou paid a huge ransom to Burgundy for his release, and arrived in the Kingdom, but since he had exhausted his funds his allies abandoned him and he had to retreat to Naples. A long siege was then established, during which the Infante Don Pedro was killed by a chance shot to the great grief of his brother. The support of the Genoese fleet allowed René to sustain the besieged capital, but finally on June 1, 1442, 300 well-armed men entered the town through an open drain accesible during the dry season, revealed to Alfons' son Ferrante by some prisoners.

EVENTNAME111020;Seek Dynastic Alliance to Castile;x
EVENTHIST111020;Aragon was inmersed in a civil war after the death of the Prince of Viana. Juan felt also the pressure from Louis XI of France that after accepting the Rousillon as a guaranty for payment in exchange for his help, had changed sides and keeping the Rousillon was now supporting the rebellion in Barcelona with troops. Given his bad relationship with Enrique IV of Castile, who had tried to steal his throne, Juan needed to ensure the neutrality of Castile, or even enlist her help, and for that he was counting on his son Fernando. Fernando had already shown his quality as a military leader, obtaining his first victory when he was 13 years old, and now at 17 was helping his father to pacify the difficult Kingdom. Juan sent ambassador Pierres de Peralta to negotiate a marriage agreement between Fernando and Beatriz, daughter of Juan Pacheco, Marquis of Villena, the most powerful noble in Castile during the rule of weak Enrique. But with the death of his brother Alfonso, Isabel had come to the forefront of Castilian politics, and was already pretended by Louis XI for his brother, the Duke of Guyenne, and by Alfonso V of Portugal for himself. Peralta understood the importance of Isabel in troubled Castile, and presented a marriage proposal to Isabel instead. Juan was soon in favor of this new arrangement, and named Fernando King of Sicily to better compete with the King of Portugal. The marriage of Isabel and Fernando could unite the two strongest Kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula solving their problems. However, when Enrique found out about the offer he was displeased, as he favored a union with Portugal and considered Juan his enemy.;x

To avoid being recognized, he disguised himself as a servant to a group of merchants, going to the extreme of having to serve them dinner at the stops. Running a serious risk, he crossed hostile territory before meeting the count of Treviño with 300 lances to protect him. Finally he arrived to Valladolid to meet his bride. It was love at first sight. However a problem remained, as Isabel and Fernando were second cousins and required papal dispensation. But Paul II was in good terms with Enrique, and had already granted a papal dispensation for Isabel and Alfonso V of Portugal, also related, and refused to give a second dispensation for the same person. But nothing could stand in the way of love, and a papal dispensation was quickly forged and dated five years before, during the papacy of Pius II. A real dispensation will not be obtained until 1471 with Sixtus IV, and by then the couple already had a daughter.;x

But the catalan serfs or remensa revolted in favor of the King against the nobles, and he had also the support of Aragon, Valencia and Sicily. The war was very long, and with foreign participation, as the catalan nobility offered the County to whoever offered help, including Enrique of Castile, Pedro of Portugal and Renee of Anjou. Finally, a blind seventy years old Juan was able to win and enter Barcelona in 1472. He wisely showed clemency and pardoned all implicated. His troubles with Louis XI continued as he tried to recover the Rousillon, ceded to the French King as a guaranty and not returned. He also helped his son Fernando, when the civil war started in Castile with the crowning of Isabel and Fernando in 1475. With the decisive defeat of the Portuguese at Toro in 1476, the war was reduced to a series of campaigns against rebel nobles. In his last days before dying of old age, Juan could finally rest, as he had secured the Kingdom of Aragon for his son, and he had set in motion the union of Aragon and Castile to form a strong iberian Kingdom.;x

The new Kings soon showed the power of a strong monarchy, administering justice everywhere, subjugating the rebellious nobles, reorganizing the military orders, and introducing church reforms.

But it was not by force that unity could be imposed, as a strong sense of freedom have been developed by the Iberians in their long struggle against Islam, manifested in an equally long struggle against their Christian neighbors.

EVENTHIST111028;Ferrán II decided to attack Mazalquivir (Mers-el-Kebir), the port of Oran (Wahran), to ensure the security of his Italian possessions from Barbary attacks. The Aragonese expedition under the naval command of Ramón de Cardona and land command of the Alcaide de los Donceles captured the fortress after a heavy bombardment. But Mazalquivir was difficult to hold, as it lacked water and had to be provisioned by dangerous sorties or by friendly tribes. Ferrán understood that another expedition to Oran was necessary to complete the task. Command of the expedition was entrusted to Pedro Navarro who landed an army of over 20,000 men and besieged the city. Navarro soon blew the walls with his mines and heavy artillery bombardment, and in the assault the Aragonese inflicted 4000 casualties in the enemy, and conquered the city. Some commanders wanted to push the conquest inland, but Navarro, under orders from the King, refused.;x

EVENTHIST111030;Pedro Navarro was left on command of Oran, and in the next season he attacked Bugia (Béjaïa), in the Eastern side of Tlemcen. Navarro disembarked 5,000 men and a train of artillery, and after defeating a far more numerous Berber army, conquered the city sacking it. Since it was still early in the season, Navarro decided to attack Tripoli. An army of 14,000 men was prepared. The city, the strongest in the campaign, was taken by assault, with over 5,000 casualties between the defenders. Immediately Navarro went to Djerba with the intention of capturing the island. After landing, they were ambushed in an oasis where 3,000 soldiers were killed. Navarro therefore returned to Tripoli. The Zayyanid Sultan of Tlemcen, Abu Abdallah Muhammad VIII, worried by the continuous defeats decided to become a vassal of Aragon in 1510.;x
#;x
EVENTHIST111032;Ferrán II had decided upon a policy of North African expansion to provide an alternate route to Sicily, and to squash piracy on the Barbary cost. However the conquest of isolated presidios (fortresses) in the coast had the exact opposite effect. Under the pressure of Aragon, the authority of the Zayyanid rulers of Tlemcen was weakened, and pirates became independent and more active all along the coast. A famous Turkish pirate named Aruj received permission from the Hafsid sultan of Tunis to use the island of Djerba (Gelves) as a base, and he captured Jijelli in 1514 and took over Algiers in 1516 when he defeated the Aragonese. He then killed the local ruler and proclaimed himself Sultan. He was known as Baba Aruj, or Father Aruj. This was translated by the Aragonese as Barbarroja (Barbarossa in Italian, or Redbeard). He became the nightmare of the Aragonese. In 1517 he supported a successful rebellion in Tlemcen, but he was driven out by the Aragonese and killed in 1518. However the balance of power in Tlemcen was shifting towards Algiers, which remained independent under the leadership of Aruj's brother, Khayr ad-Din Barbarossa, who sought the help of the Ottoman Empire.;x

EVENTHIST111033;When the Order of St. John was expelled from Rhodes in 1523, it underwent a crisis. Their possessions were being confiscated all over Europe, by both Catholic and Protestant rulers, their income was shrinking and their recruits stopped coming. They desperately needed a base, preferably by reconquering Rhodes, otherwise an island in the Aegean, but no one would help and Venice actively opposed them. Europe was at war and there was no place for their neutrality. The King of Aragon however came up with a master idea. He offered Malta to the Hospitallers. Malta was difficult to defend from the growing Ottoman power, but the Knights were a tough breed. They would give their lives defending his shipping lines to Sicily. In 1524 the Hospitallers sent a commission to Malta. Their report was very negative. The island could not sustain itself and the defences were very poor. Then Enric I decided to include Tripoli as part of an all or nothing deal. The Knights thought even less of Tripoli. They did not have the resources to upgrade its defenses, but having no other option, the Chapter General decided in 1527 to accept the offer despite the opposition of the French Langues. They still had hopes of recovering Rhodes, but in 1530 they gave up and moved to Malta, taking possession also of Tripoli. From then on, the Aragonese and the Knights of St. John would fight their battles in North Africa together.;x

Alfons threatened back with his support for an anti-Pope, Felix V, chosen at the Council of Basel, and Eugenius accepted to invest him in exchange for his support as the genuine Pope and help against the Turks that never materialized. Ferrante was named Prince of Calabria, and the Neapolitans were pleased that their Kingdom was not going to be incorporated to Aragon. Alfons, who as a Castilian had always felt a foreigner in Barcelona, never returned to Aragon, and his court in Naples was filled with the splendor of the Renaissance. Alfons soon gained the nickname of the Magnanimous.;x

EVENTHIST111043;Aragon was the first nation in the world to create a permanent specific naval infantry unit in 1537. This was the Old Company of the Sea of Naples composed by harquebusiers to fight on board galleys. In the winter of 1564 spies told of a powerful Ottoman fleet being readied in Constantinople. On May 18, 1565 their target was revealed when the Janissaries landed in Malta. From the beginning of May Aragon had been gathering her force. Finally, on August 25, the Viceroy of Sicily, García de Toledo, gave the order to depart, arriving at Malta on September 7, forcing the Ottomans to lift their siege on the exact same day they had scheduled their final full-out assault on the few surviving defenders. Had they arrived one day later, Malta would have been lost. It was clear that a reaction time of four months was not acceptable and that Aragon could not project her power far away unless a permanent force capable of landing and conducting battles that could be quickly deployed was assigned to the Navy. So in February 1566 the Tercio de la Armada del Mar Oceano, or Tercio of the Navy of the Ocean Sea, also known as Tercio de Figueroa for its first commander, was created with 6,700 soldiers. Harquebusiers from this unit were the first to assault the Sultana, the Ottoman flagship in the battle of Lepanto and, as a reward, its commander Lope de Figueroa was given the commission to inform the King of the victory.;x
#;x
EVENTHIST111044;Alfons VI had inherited a North African situation that was turning into a nightmare. The Ottomans were calling to the doors of Vienna, and in Africa they had taken over Egypt, and with the help of the Barbary pirates, they were taking over Kingdom after Kingdom, destroying the policy of alliances that his grandfather Fernando had established. He could not let them reach the Straits of Gibraltar. Worse still, they entered an alliance with France, so he was facing war simultaneously in all fronts. To add to that, the Aragonese presidios (fortresses) in Africa were very difficult to defend. When Barbarossa conquered Tunis in 1534, the fleeing Pasha al-Hassan went to the Aragonese court and asked for help in exchange for vassalage. Alfons VI could not let the Ottomans or their allies come any closer to Aragon and Italy. A huge armada was assembled and he decided to lead it in person.;x
#;x
EVENTHIST111047;After the conquest of Tunis in 1535, Alfons VI reinstated al-Hassa Ibn Muhammad as Pasha of Tunis. He left a garrison of Aragonese soldiers to help him keep control and ensure his loyalty. Tunis continued as a vassal of Aragon until 1574, when it was conquered by the Ottoman Empire.;x
#;x
EVENTHIST111048;The alliance against the Holy Roman Emperor, signed by the Most Christian King François Ier of France and the Sultan Suleiman of the Ottoman Empire, resulted in attacks by the Turks every time France fought against Aragon. The most destructive raid was the one produced after the invasion of Milan by France in 1542. Barbarossa, on command of a huge Ottoman and Barbary fleet, raided the costs of Italy, joining later a French fleet under command of the Duke of Enghien at Marseilles and both proceeded to attack Nice. At the arrival of Andrea Doria and Alfonso de Avalos, they retreated to Toulon for winter, where the churches were prohibited from ringing their bells, and Christian slaves were openly sold between Turks and pirates. While at Toulon, a fleet was dispatched to sack the coasts of Aragon. After the peace of Crépy between France and Aragon, Barbarossa returned to Istanbul, pillaging the coasts of Tuscany and Naples in the way.;x
#;x
EVENTNAME111049;Aragonese Hegemony in North Africa;x
EVENTHIST111049;After the pact between François Ier of France and the Ottoman Sultan in 1527, Alfons VI found his empire in a difficult situation. The Turks usally sent their fleets to ravage his coasts, coinciding and even coordinating with French attacks. To avoid complete Ottoman control of the Mediterranean, he took Tunis in 1535. The new Governor of Oran, Martín Alonso de Cordoba, the Conde de Alcaudete, was ordered to lead an expedition against Tlemcen which was shifting towards the Ottoman side. At Prevesa, in the Albanian cost, the combined fleets of Aragon, Venice, Genoa and Papal States, under command of Andrea Doria, were defeated by the Ottoman-Barbary fleet under Khayr ad-Din Barbarossa. Although losses were small and mostly Venetian, since Doria refused to fight, its effect was to give supremacy in the Eastern Mediterranean to the Ottomans. Besides the expedition of Alcaudete, something needed to be done to maintain Aragonese supremacy, at least in the Western Mediterranean, and so Alfons VI ordered a naval expedition against Al-Djazaúr (Algiers).;x
#;x
EVENTHIST111050;The confrontation between Aragon and the Sultan of the Ottomans was reaching Tlemcen at a delicate point, when dynastic fights were shaking the Zayyanids. The Conde de Alcaudete, military governor of Oran, joined in 1535 with tribal chief Ibn Radwan to help Zayyanid prince Abdallah overthrow his older brother Muhammad V. The expedition, including 600 Aragonese soldiers, was almost completely wiped out by the Banu Rashid tribe. However, probably because the Aragonese had taken Tunis, Sultan Muhammad agreed to pay tribute to Oran in exchange for Aragonese protection. Six years later, the expedition of more than four hundred ships sent against Barbarossa in Algiers departed too late in the season and, surprised by a storm, lost one fourth of its effectives and had to retreat. Overstretched because of the wars against France Alfons VI did not have the resources to maintain the hegemony in the Western Mediterranean against the Ottomans.;x
#;x
EVENTHIST111052;Taking advantage of the fights between different tribes in Tlemcen, the Conde de Alcaudete, military governor of Aragonese Oran, supported the Banu Rashid to dethrone Muhammad and install his brother Ahmad in 1545. Muhammad sought the help of Hassan Pasha, ruler of Al-Djazaúr and son of Khayr ad-Din Barbarossa, and was restored with the help of the Turks. Alcaudete attacked in 1547, but was driven back by the Turks. Meanwhile, in Morocco, the pro-Turkish Wattasid Sultan Ahmad was defeated by the Sa'did Muhammad al-Shaykh (al-Mahdi), who then invaded Tlemcen putting an end to 300 years of Zayyanid rule there. The Turkish reaction under Agha Hasan Quru however drove them out. Tlemcen was under Turkish control, but disputed by Moroccans and the Aragonese.;x
#;x
EVENTHIST111053;The fall of Tlemcen into Ottoman hands in 1551 put Aragonese Oran in a mortal danger. Martín Alonso de Cordoba, Conde de Alcaudete, military governor of Oran, entered into an alliance with the Sultan of Morocco, Muhammad al-Shaykh, to drive the Turks from Tlemcen. However the Ottoman Sultan Suleiman dispatched spies that assassinated Muhammad al-Shaykh in 1557. Having lost this ally for an attack on Algiers, Alcaudete marched with an army of 12,000 on Mustaghanim (Mostaganem) the next year. But tribes and the Turkish forces of Hasan Quru totalling over 70,000 men defeated them. Alcaudete was killed, and his son and most of the army were captured. The next year many of them would abjure from their beliefs to escape slavery. Tlemcen disappeared as a country, firmly in the hands of the Pashas of Al-Djazaúr who were named by the Ottoman Empire. Tripoli was lost in 1551, Bugia in 1555, and Tunis in 1570. Aragon had lost the North African game, but would successfully defend Oran and Melilla from recurrent attacks for centuries.;x
#;x
EVENTHIST111055;The Knights Hospitallers took care of the defense of Tripoli after its cession by Alfons VI for over 20 years. Provisioned by the Viceroy of Sicily and with the help of a Aragonese garrison, the Order even considered moving their see there. However in 1551 they were attacked by a huge Ottoman army under command of Sinan Pasha and Dragut. There were very few Knights in Tripoli, and the Aragonese soldiers from Calabria refused to fight, and so Tripoli was surrendered almost without fight. In 1560 the Grand Master Jean Parisot de la Valette enticed the Viceroy of Sicily, Juan de la Cerda, Duke of Medinaceli to attempt its recovery, but the expedition, approved by Enric II, was a complete failure, since Tripoli had been converted into a stronghold by huge Ottoman defensive works under the direction of Dragut.;x
#;x
EVENTHIST111056;In 1565 the help of Enric II was required by the Hospitallers to defend Malta against a combined assault by the Ottomans and Barbary pirates. The victory was very important because it put a clear limit to how far could the Ottoman Empire capable project its power. However the Ottoman Empire was at its peak, as the capture of Tunis in 1569 demonstrated. The capture of Cyprus in 1571, triggered the formation of a Holy League, mainly formed by Aragon, Venice and Papal States, with the combined fleet under command of Don Juan de Austria. The interests of Venice and Aragon were very different: Venice wanted to recover Cyprus, and Aragon wanted to recover her North African presidios, and they could only agree in fighting the Ottoman Navy. The ensuing battle at Lepanto was the biggest naval battle in modern times with over 32,000 casualties (by comparison Trafalgar had only 3,000), 25,000 of them on the Ottoman side which was almost completely destroyed. News of the victory were extremely well received by the Christians that had suffered from Ottoman and Barbary piracy. Although the Ottomans rebuilt their fleet and recaptured Tunis a second time in 1574, their naval supremacy in the Mediterranean was destroyed forever.;x
#;x
EVENTHIST111058;After the conquest of Tunis in 1535, Alfons VI reinstated al-Hassa Ibn Muhammad as Pasha of Tunis. He left a garrison of Spanish soldiers to help him keep control and ensure his loyalty. Tunis continued as a vassal of Spain until 1574, when it was conquered by the Ottoman Empire.;x
#;x
EVENTHIST111059;Enric II just did not have the money to pursue a North African conquest, but the rebellion of the Moriscos in 1569, at a time when Tunis was conquered for the Ottomans by the famous pirate and Beylerbey of Algiers, Uluj Ali, made him painfully aware of the dangers of ignoring that front. With great effort, the Moriscos rebellion was put down and the Ottoman fleet defeated at Lepanto. But although Tunis was briefly recovered, it was quickly lost again due to lack of resources. But he was not alone in having problems. The Ottomans, defeated at Malta and Lepanto, found themselves also overstretched due to the demands of their conflicts with Persia. Under these circumstances, Enric II and Murad III negotiated a series of truces between 1577 and 1581. In these truces Enric II renounced the former Aragonese conquests in North Africa, while the Ottoman sultan renounced Oran and would not lend help to the Moriscos. The peace between Aragon and the Ottoman Empire would be permanent, and would allow both empires to abandon the Mediterranean, which was left in the hands of the Barbary pirates, periodically checked by the European navies.;x

On 22 June 1422, Antonio I and the Signoria's envoy Tommaso Alderotti confirmed the arrangement which gave Florence the same trading rights as the Venetians in Negroponte. Continued amicable relations would play a role in installing Antonio's successor Nerio II. On 7 August 1422, he conceded privileges to Florentine merchants in Athens. In that year, Alfonso V of Aragon asserted his claim by appointing Tommaso Beraldo, a Catalan, duke.

EVENTNAME3097;The Winter King of Prague;x
EVENTHIST3097;In 1608 the tension increased between the catholic parts and the protestant parts of the empire. The Protestants entered a union under the prince Fredrik of Pfalz that was supported by Brandenburg and Hessen-Kassel. The Catholics answered by forming a union of their own, the catholic league. It was led by Maximilian of Bavaria. In 1618 the Protestants of Bohemia rebelled by throwing catholic emissaries from the windows of their mansion. They continued to choose a protestant King of Bohemia, prince Fredrik of Pfalz. The emperor couldn't accept this, as he also was King of Bohemia. He sent his experienced commander Jean Tcerclaes Tilly with his troops to Bohemia and in the battle of the White Mountain (8 November 1620), Fredrik of Pfalz reign ended and all protestant resistance in Austria and southern Germany was crushed.

EVENTHIST3178;Mary of Valois was the only daughter of Charles le Téméraire (Charles the Bold) and so heiress of all the rich Burgundian domains from the Saone River up to the Low Countries. When her father died in 1477 at the age of 43, Mary was only nineteen and Louis XI of France seized the opportunity provided with his rival's death to take possession of the duchy of Burgundy and also of Franche-Comté, Picardie and Artois. He justified his military intervention with the fact that these lands had always been fiefs to the French crown and that with Charles' death, the last member of the French Valois dynasty they had 'de facto', according to the salic law, reverted to France. But the choice of which prince should marry the duchess would be of particular importance for the future political and economical stability of Western Europe, so he urged Mary to accept his son, the Dauphin Charles, as husband, in order to secure the inheritance of the Low Countries for his descendants too, even by force of arms if necessary. Mary, however, distrusted Louis and declined any French support and offer of marriage but, in order to be recognized as legitimate ruler over the Low Countries and to get financial and military help of Flemish cities against the French aggression, she made so great concessions as to reduce the Burgundian states effectively to a sort of federation of provinces. Satisfied that the country was sufficiently weakened and disorganized, Louis XI ordered his army into Artois and Hainault, but the imminence of danger seemed to revive in the Burgundian provinces a spirit of loyalty towards the Valois heiress and arrangements were made for the marriage of Mary with Maximilian of Habsburg, Archduke of Austria and son of the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick III.;x

EVENTHIST3188;A temporary doctrinal agreement was proclaimed in May 1548 between German Catholics and Protestants and became imperial law on June 30, 1548. It was prepared and accepted at the insistence of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, who hoped to establish temporary religious unity in Germany until differences could be worked out in a general council of the Catholic Church. The Augsburg Interim primarily reflected a Catholic viewpoint. It did, however, allow clerical marriage and communion in both kinds (bread and wine) for the laity. Several Protestant electors objected to the Catholic emphasis of the Augsburg Interim and refused to abide by it. Charles attempted to force its acceptance, an action that led the Protestants to adopt the Leipzig Interim, which upheld Protestant doctrines, at a subsequent Diet. Neither interim was fully accepted so a German religious settlement was not brought about until the Peace of Augsburg (1555).;x

It determined that in the future no member of the empire should make war against another on religious grounds and that this peace should remain operative until the denominations were peacefully reunited. Only two denominations were recognized, the Roman Catholics and the Lutherans. Moreover, in each territory of the empire, only one denomination was to be recognized, the religion of the prince's choice being thus made obligatory for his subjects. Protestant and Catholic citizens in the free and imperial cities remained free to exercise their religion as they pleased. The wish for a lasting settlement was so strong that the compromise peace, which satisfied no one completely and had many loopholes, was accepted. In spite of its shortcomings, the Peace of Augsburg saved the empire from serious internal conflicts for more than 50 years.;x

EVENTHIST3195;The 1620's were characterized by long and cold winters, late springs and cold and wet summers, leading to crop-failure and sharp increases in grain prices. Into this atmosphere of enhanced tension broke a climatic event of unusual severity. In 1626, during the last week of May, in the middle of the vegetation period, winter returned. The temperature fell so that lakes and rivers froze and trees shed their leaves. The unexpected return of winter caused panic and anxiety among the peasants who could not remember ever experiencing such destruction of their fields. This event, combined with the brutal persecution of protestants, led the mainly protestant peasants of Upper Austria, pledged to Bavaria, to revolt. The peasants were defeated after heavy fighting, and in 1628 the country passed into the hands of the emperor again.;x

EVENTNAME3196;The Edict of Restitution;x
EVENTHIST3196;The first phase of the Thirty Years War saw the defeat of the rebellious protestant nobles of Bohemia who were punished severely and their lands expropriated because of their decision to depose Ferdinand of Austria in favor of the Protestant Palatine elector as Bohemian King. Consequently religious persecutions began in Bohemia to eradicate Protestantism from that land. To penalize Friedrich V of the Palatinate and to reward Maximilian of Bavaria, Ferdinand deprived Friedrich of his electorate and of the Upper Palatinate and granted both to Bavaria. That was an obvious violation of imperial law, but since no German prince was really in a position to defy Ferdinand and Maximilian, it was done and Maximilian had achieved a recognition proportionate to his power. An unsuccessful attempt to help the Lutheran rulers of neighboring Lower Saxony made by King Christian IV of Denmark who, himself a Lutheran and, as Duke of Holstein, an Imperial nobleman, feared that Denmark's sovereignty as a Protestant nation was being threatened. The Danish army was routed by the fiercer imperial troops under the command of Albrecht von Wallenstein, who was given by Emperor Ferdinand II free hand in pillaging all the territories his army would have crossed or captured from the enemy. The victories of the Catholic League against the German Protestant princes persuaded Ferdinand II to issue the Edict of Restitution with the intention to take back the Lutheran holdings that were, according to the Peace of Augsburg, rightfully the possession of the Catholic Church. So this brief document purported to do no more than enforce the terms of the Peace of Augsburg. However, the interpretation put on that document was that which had been urged by partisans of Catholicism. Thus it became the source of outrage for King Gustav II Adolphus of Sweden (the Lion of the North) who, like Christian IV before him, came to aid the German Lutherans to forestall Catholic aggression against their homeland and to obtain economic influence in the German states around the Baltic Sea which were threatened by the imperial authority.;x

During times of foreign war, nobles were granted rights which the crown then tried to recall as soon as peace came. This, naturally, often triggered revolts. Following this pattern, taxes and military drafts were imposed upon the nobles after Hungary's decisive victory over the Turks in 1699. But, when Austria went to war with France in 1703, the nobles revolted once again, and forced the Emperor Charles V to restore the old system of noble privileges, in the Peace of Szatmar of 1711.;x

Prussia intervened in July 1778 in what she saw as a dangerous Austrian expansion. It was a short conflict which started with a Prussian invasion of Bohemia but was terminated in May 1779s when Empress Maria Theresa forced her son Joseph II to capitulate.

His career primed in 1809 when he was assigned the post as minister of Austrian foreign affairs. Until 1813 Metternich will pursue a policy of acquiescence to French supremacy. A policy which ends with the creation of the Quadruple Alliance, the war against France, and the allied victory the very same year. The following 35 years have been called the Age of Metternich for during this time he was the chief arbiter of Europe. The Metternich system depended upon political and religious censorship, espionage, and the suppression of revolutionary and nationalist movements.

EVENTHIST3209;Many countries had view the French revolution with neutral mistrust or eager interest, but with the Reign of Terror and the Execution of King Louis most countries became abhorred. The New Republic and its ideas undermined the 'Old Order' that existed in most European countries. Those several alliances were set up to restore the Bourbons to the French Throne, crush the revolution and get Europe back to normal again. This succeeded in 1814 and again in 1815 when foreign armies brought Louis XVIII on the throne. Louis XVIII was the brother of the Executed King Louis of France and in early life was known as the Comte de Provence. He remained in Paris after the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789 but escaped to Belgium two years later. After King Louis' execution in 1793 he proclaimed himself regent, and after the death of his brother's heir in 1795, he took the title Louis XVIII. He lived as an exile in various European countries until he became King after Napoléon's first abdication in 1814. On Napoléon's return to power in 1815, however, Louis again fled to Belgium;x

He also abolished serfdom and (temporarily) eased up on official censorship. However, Joseph was also an extreme centralist. In 1784 he informed the Hungarian government that it's official language, Latin, was really not effective for modern government and would be changed to German. To add to their horror, Joseph refused to submit to a coronation in Hungary lest he have to swear to uphold laws that he did not wish to, and then he had the sacred crown of the Kingdom moved to Vienna. In March 1787 Joseph swept away the constitution of the Austrian Netherlands and announced that from then on it would be ruled according to absolutist principles. Resistance simmered in the Austrian Netherlands until 1789 when it boiled over into open revolt. By that time there also were rumors of rebellion in Hungary and in Galicia, and for a time it appeared as if revolution might erupt in many parts of the monarchy.;x

EVENTNAME17359;Tuscany and the revolt in Siena;x
EVENTHIST17359;In 1549 after increasing turmoil in Siena, the Spanish representative of the city, Don Diego di Mendoza, decided to build a fortress to ensure Spanish control of the territory. This decision was received with horror by the Sienese who begged with Charles V not to proceed. He refused, and several Sienese citizens in Rome received aid from French agents and collected an army. In 1552, as they marched on Siena the people revolted and threw out the Spanish troops, and an independent Siena took up a pro-French policy. Henri II, King of France, tried to exploit the situation by sending there an army led by Paul de Termes, who was successively substituted by Strozzi when an invasion of Corsica was attempted with the help of the Turkish fleet. On Emperor Charles V's decision to inflict an exemplary punishment upon the rebeling city, Cosimo I Duke of Tuscany responded to his call by invading and pillaging the villages surrounding Siena with the help of Spanish/imperial troops. After a year long siege laid by Medeghino and his Florentine troops, the city of Siena was eventually taken. Should we call on Tuscany to help us against Siena?;x

EVENTHIST17408;The 14,000 lansquenets, hired by Charles V in the war against the League of Cognac under the command of Georg von Frundsberg, were animated by a violent spirit of crusade against the Pope (Frundsberg was bringing a golden rope with which he insanely meant to hang the Pope and his cardinals!) but also, and most of all, angry for lack of pay. Abandoned by their captains, they begun to plunder villages in search of loots. Soon they were joined by 6,000 Spanish soldiers lead by Charles, Connétable de Bourbon, and by any sort of ruffians of any condition (mercenaries at the Emperor's service, deserting or disbanded troops of the League and common criminals), all of them with the common aim to make the way to Rome, the city of sin, and 'sack' it. On the morning of 6 May 1527, from his headquarters set up on the Gianicolo hill, Captain General Bourbon with his 40,000 soldiers launched a series of attacks on Rome. During one of them, at the Torrione Gate, while leading the assault of the walls, he himself was mortally wounded (Benvenuto Cellini, who took part in the defence of the walls, would boast about having shot the deadly bullet). Instead of being let down, the Spanish troops' confidence was boosted by their commander's sudden death and at the expenses of big losses, managed to break through the city walls and enter the Borgo while the imperial lansquenets broke rushed towards the Holy See. Pope Clement VII and his followers were able to escape into safety, thanks to the 'Passetto', a secret corridor which Pope Alexander VI had built along the top of the wall connecting the Vatican with Castel Sant'Angelo. Across the Sisto bridge the bewildered soldiers fell on the unarmed city and for eight days committed every sort of violence, theft, sacrilege and massacre. The streets were a mixture of drunken soldiers, corpses and heaps of every sort of luxury goods taken from churches, monasteries and palaces. No league army dared to enter the city to drive out the ravaging troops and rescue the Pope, who accepted to pay a huge ransom only six months later. Although the exact role of the emperor in this act is unclear, it hurt his standing internationally, and caused something of a domestic crisis. It was one of the motivations for the alliance between England and France in 1527, and for the war with those countries that followed.;x

EVENTNAME179033;Franz Schubert;x
EVENTHIST179033;Schubert showed an extraordinary childhood aptitude for music. By 1814 he had produced piano pieces, string quartets, a symphony and an opera. His huge output of 1814-15 includes numerous songs, besides two more symphonies, three masses and four stage works. From this time he enjoyed the companionship of several friends. Frequently gathering for evenings of Schubert's music, this group represented the new phenomenon of an educated, musically aware middle class. In 1818 more songs poured out, including 'Der Wanderer', and instrumental pieces: piano sonatas and the 5 and 6 Symphonies began to show increased harmonic subtlety. Schubert's fame was long limited to that of a songwriter, since the bulk of his large output was not even published until the late 19th century. Yet he produced major instrumental masterpieces. These are marked by an intense lyricism, a spontaneous chromatic modulation that is surprising yet clearly purposeful, and an imagination that creates its own formal structures.;x

The works at Esterháza show an increasing enterprise, originality and freedom of style as well as melodic fluency, command of form, and humour, which carried Haydn's reputation beyond central Europe. In 1790, Nikolaus Esterházy died, but Haydn was retained by his son and was free to live in Vienna. In his last years his works show great diversity of style and seriousness of content yet retaining his vitality and fluency of utterance. At that time he composed his two great oratorios, 'The Creation' and 'The Seasons', clearly influenced by those of Haendel. Haydn died in 1809, after twice dictating his recollections and preparing a catalogue of his works. He was widely revered and is regarded, with justice, as father of the symphony and the string quartet.;x

EVENTHIST179043;Under the pretext that they were secretly cooperating with the heretic Hussites and Vaudois and using old religious prejudices against Jews, Duke Albrecht V of Austria ordered a large wave of persecution of Jews in Austria. Besides religious fanaticism, an important reason for Albrecht to do this was that he hoped to gain money for his campaign against the Bohemian Hussites. On May 23rd 1420, all Jews living in the Ducal cities of Austria were captured and their estate confiscated. The children were forcefully baptized. Among the adult Jews, the poor were banished from the country, while the rich were kept hostage and tortured in order find out were they hid the massive treasures that they were accused of having. In order to avoid torture, loss of their property, forced conversion and the continuous humiliation, most of the Jews from Vienna committed suicide in their synagogue. Only about 300 Jews remained in Vienna, and even these were not tolerated. Using the standard fake reproach against Jews, the desecration of housels, Albrecht condemned 210 Jews to be burned at the stake on March 21st 1421. Within only a year, a large, prosperous Jewish community that had been the backbone of Austria's economy and a major creditor of the Habsburgs throughout the 14th century had been almost completely exterminated.;x

EVENTNAME179045;Death of Emperor Sigmund;x
EVENTHIST179045;Emperor Sigmund, father in law of Duke Albrecht V of Austria, died on December 9th 1437. Sigmund had always wanted Albrecht to succeed him in the Empire and the Kingdoms of Bohemia and Hungary. Although in neither of the three realms this choice was universally recognized as legally binding and there were demands for a free election of the successor, he managed to succeed to all three crowns. This was the first union of Austria, Bohemia and Hungary and the beginning of Habsburg ambitions to dominate Southeast Europe. Albrecht's rule in the Empire however remained merely nominal  in fact he was never even crowned  and in Bohemia was opposed by a faction of Hussites supporting Casimir of Poland, which resulted in a prolonged civil war and his authority in Bohemia becoming completely ineffective.;x

EVENTNAME179047;The Diet of Buda;x
EVENTHIST179047;The Privy Council of the Emperor met and discussed the modalities of the coronation as King of Hungary. Some council members advocated using the opportunity the Habsburgs had at that time, due to their military control of the country, to subjugate the defiant Hungarians once and for all and introduce absolutistic rule in Hungary iure belli, by the law of war. The Emperor himself however decided to opt for a reconciliation with the Estates of Hungary that would secure the power of his dynasty in that Kingdom without abolishing its constitution which would almost certainly eventually provoke another large-scale uprising. Thus, at a Diet convoked in Buda he agreed to confirm Hungary's constitution with three amendments: the succession was made hereditary in the male line of the Habsburgs, the ius resistendi, the right of the Hungarian subjects to rebel against a monarch who violated the constitution, was abolished, and the promise of the Emperor to 'observe the country's laws and privileges' was modified by the clause 'as the King and the assembled Estates shall agree on the interpretation and application thereof'.

EVENTHIST179053;In 1740s the problem of Maria Theresia's succession to the Austrian throne and to the Habsburg inheritance caused a big instability in the European balance of powers which led to the War of Austrian succession. The peace that followed the conflict, provoked by the foreign opposition to the Pragmatic Sanction stated by the former Emperor Charles VI and ended with the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, resulted in a well defined rivalry between major European powers forming essentially two main political formations: the alliance of the socalled 'Bourbon family pact' (France, Spain, Naples and the latest Parma, all with members of the same House of Bourbons) with Prussia and the alliance between Austria, Russia and England. Disappointed by England's interested approaches to the emerging power of Prussia wich led to the Convention of Westminster, a treaty with which both countries would avoid any foreign military presence or access in the German territories, Austria strengthened her political ties with Saxony, Russia and Sweden and started new diplomatic handlings with France, traditionally an arch-enemy of the Habsburgs since the old dispute over the Burgundian inheritance but for sure the most powerful antagonist to the rising British colonial empire. And an alliance with France would also mean the support of Spain and the Bourbon Italian monarchies. That diplomatic move would lead to a huge world conflict fought in the years between 1756 and 1763: the socalled 'Seven Years War'.;x

On 20 march 1786 Joseph II decided to change the flag hoisted over all the Habsburgs dominions within the Holy Roman Empire with a more appropriate flag for Austria. However the use of red and white colours dates back to 1191 when, according to legend, duke Leopold got his white tunic entirely bloodstained by the end of a fierce battle fought at Ptolemais (Acre) except the part of the tunic protected by the wide belt which he found out still white, when taking his belt off. Losing his standard during the fray, Leopold supposedly raised his tunic as a rallying point, and that was when the design was subsequently made official.

EVENTHIST179080;For years Europe has been preparing for the death of childless Carlos II of Spain. He was related to several royal families in Europe, but after the death of the designated heir, Joseph Ferdinand Wittelbach of Bavaria, at the age of six, the royal houses of Austria and France had a similar claim, although according to the Spanish laws of succession the right of the French Dauphin preceded that of the Habsburg. But both nations were too powerful, and the addition of the Spanish empire would make any of them unstoppable, and so candidates not destined to their thrones, Philip of Anjou and Charles Habsburg, were discussed as heirs to Carlos, and several partition agreements were negotiated. That is precisely what everybody wanted to prevent in Spain. Despite the bigger influence from the Austracist party led by the mother of Carlos, there was an undisputable fact: France had 300,000 soldiers next to Spain and the Spanish Netherlands, and so represented the only opportunity, albeit small, to keep the empire together. A will was redacted and the agonizing Carlos signed it. It bequeathed the Kingdom to Philip Anjou, but it contained two crucial clauses, the condition that the crowns of France and Spain should never be held by the same person, and the condition that if any partition took place, then the crown of Spain should go to Charles Habsburg. Austria, of course, rejected it, starting the war in Italy, but the rest of Europe seemed to agree, as the equilibrium was not broken. But, could Louis XIV resist the temptation?\n \n Historically the Austrian Empire was quite successful despite losing the Spanish throne. The Spanish Netherlands became the Austrian Netherlands, Milan, the Kingdom of Naples, Sicily and Sardina were conquered. But historically only Milan and the Austrian Netherlands would stay in Austrian hands - the southern Italian possesions were either lost in the next war or traded away. Should we try only to achieve what was historically achieved - or should we try to be more successful than history?;x

EVENTNAME179081;Charles proclaimed King of Spain in Vienna;x
EVENTHIST179081;The formation of the Grand Alliance and the start of the war made it possible for Charles Habsburg to push his bid for the Spanish crown. Although initially the Grand Alliance did not seek to replace Felipe Bourbon as King of Spain, by 1703 England and the United Provinces (Netherlands) had decided that their commercial interests would be better protected by Habsburg rule. The issue was also important to win another ally, as Portugal was hesitant to enter a war unless on the side of the future King of Spain, her future neighbour. The Austrians, on their part, were convinced that the invasion of Spain could only be achieved with the concurrence of English and Portuguese troops. Once the support of their allies was secured, Charles was proclaimed King of Spain by the imperial court in Vienna in September 1703. This proclamation was important also for the supporters that Charles had in Spain, that could raise in arms in the hope of being on the winning side.;x

EVENTHIST179082;The war of Spanish succession seemed about to be won by the Grand Alliance in 1709, with France completely defeated in all fronts. Only the war in Spain seemed favorable to the Bourbons, but Louis XIV was ready to abandon his grandson in exchange for peace. But the allies were frustrated by their inability to impose the Archduke on the Spaniards, and surprised by their stern resistance, and went too far in their conditions demanding that Louis should remove his own grandson from the throne of Spain by force. This was a humiliation too big to endure, and Louis understood that he was negotiating from a position of weakness and decided to break the negotiations and renew the fight. Time would prove him right, as dissensions were already dividing the allies as the French threat receded. The Dutch and the Austrians were already at odds over the Spanish Netherlands, and the Austrians were seeing as not doing their part, occupied with the Hungarian revolt. The turning point was the unexpected death of Emperor Joseph I, at 33 years of age in April 1711. While Charles left Spain and went to Vienna to be elected emperor, the allies were not ready to reconstruct the empire of Charles V, and England immediately started peace negotiations with France without informing the Dutch or Austria.;x

EVENTNAME179083;The Peace of Utrecht;x
EVENTHIST179083;The Spanish war of succession was also slow to end. Since Spain and Austria had not settled the issue and it was impossible to reach an agreement between all participants, it was decided that separate peace treaties between the parties would end the war. To Austria, the English decission was little less than treason, but Austrian participation in the war had been less than stellar, consumed as she was by her war against the Ottoman empire and the rebellions in Hungary. During the 1713 season, Austria tried to continue the campaign of the Rhine, but failed to achieve any significant result. The Spanish Netherlands had already been guaranteed for Austria by the treaty between France and the United Provinces, and the French were most than willing to sign a separate peace and surrender all the Spanish Italian possessions in their hands. Already in March 1713, Elizabeth Christine Brunswick, regent of Spain on behalf of Charles II of Habsburg, had left Barcelona, abandoning the Spanish Austracists and leaving Stahrenberg to reach an agreement with Felipe V. Finally Charles signed the peace with France at Radstatt (March 6, 1714) and Baden (September 7, 1714). Charles had won the Spanish Netherlands, Milan, Naples, Sardinia (later exchanged for Sicily to Savoy) and Mantua (whose Duke Ferdinando Carlo was declared deposed because of his siding with France in the war), and restored the right bank of the Rhine to the empire, but he had lost the throne of Spain. An agreement with Spain was impossible, and will lead to the Spanish invasion of Sardinia and Sicily in 1717-1718, and to the formation of the Quadruple Alliance that would impose the treaty of the Hague to Spain on February 17, 1720, sealing the peace between Austria and Spain. At the Peace of Utrecht, Felipe, as King of Spain, renounced his right to the crown of France, and Charles renounced the crown of Spain. During the war of Polish succession, Felipe will finally be able to recover Naples and Sicily from Austria.;x

Although there were supporters for both monarchs in all regions of Spain, the disenchantment with the Habsburg rule and the admiration for the French centralized model was higher in the former Kingdom of Castile, while in Catalonia, besides the opposite sentiment, there was a profound hatred of the French for the loss of the Roselló and the bombardment of Barcelona by the French fleet a few years before.;x

Maximilian decided to support Charles, who in 1516 was already Archduke of Burgundy, King of Spain, Sicily and Naples, in his investiture as King of the Romans and future Holy Roman Emperor. But this diplomatic move would have been very expensive. Most of the German princes were already supporting the French candidate, King François Ier. Maximilian seemed to successfully convoy the favour of the imperial electors towards the Habsburg cause, by means of granting investitures and making promises of large sums of money with the help of bankers such as the Fuggers and the Welsers. The Pope, who couldn't accept the presence of an Emperor with territorial claims in Italy as it was under the rule of Emperor Frederick II, would have supported a German prince like Friedrich III of Saxony, with no particular interest laying beyond the Alps.

EVENTNAME179102;Coronation of Ladislaus Postumus in Hungary;x
EVENTHIST179102;In 1439 Albrecht of Habsburg, King of Hungary, fell ill, probably of cholera, while campaigning against the Ottomans. Within one month he died, leaving two minor daughters and his pregnant wife Elizabeth. For the case of the unborn child being male, Albrecht declared that his son would be his successor in all his fiefs just before his death. Based on thiswill, Elizabeth attempted to get the Parliament to appoint her Queen Regent for her unborn baby. Still feeling menaced by the Ottomans, a majority of the Diet consisting mostly of the middle and lower nobility however did not want to trust the country's fortune upon a woman and an unborn child and, led by the Transylvanian noble Janos Hunyadi, desired an adult King with a decent powerbase instead. It was Hunyadi who proposed the most obvious choice, Wladyslaw III, King of the other big Christian Kingdom in East Europe, Poland. Initially with the consent of Elizabeth, deputies of the Diet approached the nineteen-year-old Wladyslaw in Krakow and offered him the Hungarian crown. Meanwhile, Elizabeth gave birth to a son, the male heir Albrecht and she had hoped for, and called him Ladislaus. Since then, she was determined to secure the throne for her child and thus withdrew her approval of the offer to the Polish King. Acknowledging Albrecht's will, the Hungarian Diet has followed her wish and terminated the negotiations with Wladyslaw. Ladislaus Postumus, as he is called since he was born after his father's death, will be crowned King of Hungary in Stuhlweißenburg. Now it's upon Habsburg to defend Europe against the Ottoman threat.;x

EVENTHIST179104;Elizabeth of Luxemburg, the mother of Ladislaus Postumus, who had tried to secure the Hungarian throne for her son against Wladyslaw III of Poland, died on December 13th 1443. With Emperor Friedrich V lacking the energy and ability to continue the efforts for the crown of St. Stephen, the Pope encouraging a settlement that would allow for a Hungarian crusade against the Ottomans and fortune in battle against the supporters of Ladislaus, the succession conflict in Hungarian was practically ended by this.

After his death in 1462 however the remaining Romanists, unwilling to raise the Rozmbergs to a higher rank than the numerous other Bohemian dynasties and fearing a reemergence of their Hussite opponents, accepted a permanent personal union with Austria.;x

EVENTHIST179109;Having been offered the throne by some malcontent nobles, in 1459 Friedrich III was crowned King of Hungary with the crown of St. Stephen that had been in his possession since 1440. When Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary, had managed to crush the rebellious nobles and secure his diplomatic positions by reaching agreements with Jiri Podiebrad of Bohemia and the mercenary Jan Vitovec who had seized the former Cilli estates and he was about to threaten Austria, Friedrich quickly accepted a treaty in which we abandonned his claim on Hungary, but kept the title of King of Hungary, retained several border districts including the towns of Guns and Eisenstadt, was ceded the city of Sopron, received a ransom of 60000 ducats for the crown of St. Stephen and was appointed heir of Matthias in case of a childless death.;x

EVENTNAME179110;Vienna captured by Matthias Corvinus;x
EVENTHIST179110;Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary, was the nemesis of Emperor Friedrich V. They both claimed the Hungarian and Bohemian throne, they mistrusted each other, they both were eager to dominate southeastern Europe - thus saw each other as their greatest obstacle - and they were contrary characters, Friedrich patient, contemplative, fatalistic and sometimes phlegmatic, Matthias determined, ambitious and aggressive. Thus the peace concluded between Poland, Bohemia and Hungary in 1477 did not include Friedrich. The rivalry between the two, before sparked by Friedrich suspecting Matthias of secretly allowing the Ottomans to invade Austria through Hungary and supporting Wladislas Jagiello as King of Bohemia against the claims of Matthias, deteriorated into a personal feud. On the battlefield, Matthias Corvinus got the upper hand, swiftly defeated Friedrich even after he had gathered an Imperial army and invaded his hereditary lands. Within 5 years Matthias army reduced Frederick's strongholds one by one. The Emperor was deeply humiliated and his defeat evident in 1485 when Hungarian armies captured Vienna and he had to flee to Linz. In the last years of his life he was deeply depressive due to this shame. Vienna was only recaptured by his son Maximilian.;x

EVENTNAME179111;Inheritance of Hungary;x
EVENTHIST179111;Matthias Corvinus of Hungary died in 1490, before having secured the succession to the throne of his illegitimate son Janos. The Hungarian nobles, fed up with the strong authority and high taxes of Corvinus, quickly deprived Janos of his claim and looked for a foreign candidate that would be an easily influenced, weak puppet monarch. Seeing how he had been forced to give concessions to the estates and cities of Burgundy, they think they found such a monarch in Maximilian of Austria and have elected him King of Hungary.;x

EVENTHIST179112;After Mathias Corvinus of Hungary's sudden death, a bitter conflict over his succession has arisen. Following his explicit wish, his illegitimate son Janos has been crowned King, however there is considerable resistance among the magnates who are fed up with strong royal authority and high taxes. They have decided to revolt against the new King in order to protect their interest. Meanwhile, Friedrich III still bears the title King of Hungary and he and his son Maximilian are regarded by some Hungarians as legitimate successor to the throne. Taking advantage of the conflict within it, it might be easy to press the claim and conquer Hungary now.;x

EVENTHIST179113;Having inherited Tyrol from the childless Sigismund, Maximilian instantly fell in love with the country and the city of Innsbruck. He called it 'a peasant's garb that keeps me warm'. The mountains, the abundance of game and the beautiful nature always attracted him to Tyrol where he used to hunt or go climbing in the Alps. Innsbruck became the center of his Empire and his new administrative institutions. It was also turned into a center of arts, with the painter Albrecht Dürer, the moulders Stefan Godl, Peter Fischer and Peter Löffler and the architect and sculptor Nikolaus Türing working there for the emperor. Trade between Italy and Germany was directed through Innsbruck, which became also the economic center of Austria and Southern Germany. Exploiting the vast iron resources of Tyrol, cannons and other weapons were produced in the new gun foundries in Mühlau and Büchsenhausen. The arsenal in Sill near Innsbruck became the one of the biggest in Europe.;x

EVENTHIST179119;Upon the death of Vinzenz II, his Duchy passed to a French cousin Karl I - Herzog von Nevers. But Kaiser Ferdinand II who wed Eleanora Gonzaga (Vinzenz's sister) wanted Mantua for himself. He supported Herzog von Guastalla's claim to Mantua and Herzog von Savoyern's claim to Montferrat. With help from Spain, Savoyern occupied Montferrat while the Kaiser's army sacked Mantua (1629) but French intervention ended Savoyern's dream with the Peace of Susa (Apr 1630). Gustavus II Adolphus of Sweden's entrance into the Thirty Years War (1618-48) forced Ferdinand II to sign the Peace of Regensburg (Oct 1630) allowing his troops to fight elsewhere. Ludwig XIII's refusal prolonged the Mantuan campaign til Cherasco (1631) which gave our allies some of the territories they sought.;x

Unfavourable terms for France in the Peace of Regensburg (Oct 1630) prolonged the war, but developments in Germany helped restore peace at Cherasco (6 April 1631). Gonzagas's testimony was revised whereby Mayenne's father, Herzog von Nevers received Mantua. Guastalla gained lands Luzzara and Reggiolo whilst Savoy got parts of Montferrat.

EVENTNAME179144;The Treaty of Pessarowitz;x
EVENTHIST179144;Having been defeated decisively by a coalition of Austria, Russia, Poland and Venice and lost control over large chunks of the Balkan, the Ottoman Empire was forced to sign a humiliating peace treaty in 1699 in the Serbian city of Karlowitz. All rights to Hungary except the Banat of Temesvar, Croatia and Slavonia were ceded to Austria, Podolia to Poland, Dalmatia and the Peloponnesus to Venice. Russia got Azov in a separate treaty signed in 1700. Except for Greece, none of these losses was ever recovered permanently. The disintegration of the Ottoman Empire had begun. However the power in the Balkans shifted even more in the favour of Austria in the following years when the struggle continued. Historically Austrias great leader Prince Eugene of Savoy won a battle at Peterwardein and with the treaty of Pessarowitz a large part of the Ottoman Balkans became Austrian. Too large a part to hold on to it, for historically most of it was lost again to the Ottomans in another war. Will we be prudent and lay claim only to what Austria historically was able to take and keep - or will we allow Prince Eugene to recklessly drive the Ottomans as far south as he can and risk to lose those areas later?;x

EVENTHIST179202;Duke Johann Wilhelm of Jülich, Cleves and Berg died on March 25th 1609, in a state of complete insanity and without a child or brother. While in the United Duchies a woman could not succeed to the throne herself, succession through a female relative was possible. Hence the husbands of Johann Wilhelm's sisters claimed the inheritance. Duke Albrecht Friedrich of Prussia, married to the oldest sister Marie-Eleonore, had no male heir himself and ceded his claim to the husband of his daughter Anna, Elector Johann Sigismund of Brandenburg. This claim was questioned by the husband of the second sister Anna, Philipp Ludwig of Palatinate-Neuburg, who wanted the inheritance for his son Wolfgang Wilhelm. The Count of Nevers-Rethel, originally a sidebranch of the Cleves ducal dynasty, and the Elector of Saxony considered themselves legitimate heirs by virtue of several treaties, and the Emperor, desiring to expand the Habsburgs' supply base near the rebellious Netherlands, declared both female succession and the treaties invalid and was about to confiscate the United Duchies as a lapsed fief.

EVENTNAME179700;Imperial Diet at Worms;x
EVENTHIST179700;In the end of the 15th century the Holy Roman Empire of German Nation was far from being an effective state. While strong national Kingdoms had formed in France, England, Spain and almost all other European nations, it had remained a medieval anachronism, a body composed of independent princes, cities, bishoprics and republics unable to act as one. The need for a reform was obvious, and acknowledged by a strong movement for imperial reform that emerged in the late 1480s. However, such a reform was hindered by conflicting ideas on what state should be the outcome of the reform. One group, consisting of the Emperor and his allies among the imperial cities and the weaker princes of the realm, supported reforms that would enable the Emperor to exploit Germany's considerable resources more effectively than in the past. What they wanted was a stronger authority of the Emperor and an effective national kingdom. This was opposed by those who would lose ground by such a reform, the powerful princes, led by the German Archchancellor, Archbishop-Elector Berthold von Henneberg of Mainz. The faction of the princes wanted a more clearly federal structure that would give their autonomy a legal base and increase their rights to participate in ruling the Empire. The Emperor eventually had to seek a compromise that was strongly in favour of the princes in order to get the urgently needed reforms done. Thus several reforms, including the Perpetual Peace which outlawed feuding in the whole Empire forever, the establishment of the Imperial Chamber Court, a tribunal financed and factually controlled by the princes that was to arbitrate conflict between members of the Empire, the creation of Imperial Circles, regional districts that had the tasks to enforce Imperial Chamber Court decisions, to control minting and to assemble and maintain contingents for the Imperial Army , and the introduction of the Common Penny, a direct, universal property and poll tax that was supposed to finance the defence of the Emperor and the Chamber Court, were passed by an Imperial Diet at Worms in 1495. Our excellent diplomatic position within the Empire, especially the certain support of a great majority within the council of electors, would allow us to push more extensive reforms that could ensure a more effective administration and could turn Germany into a powerful national kingdom. This would surely meet resistance within the Empire and among the neighbouring countries that would feel threatened by such a state.;x

EVENTHIST179701;Against resistance from inside and outside, we have managed to get the reforms needed to turn Germany from a powerless feudalistic entity held together loosely by the Imperial crown into a modern national Kingdom by another Imperial Diet at Augsburg. Most of Germany has been reorganized into Imperial circles that are firmly under the authority of the Imperial Chamber Court and other new institutions and have to supply the Emperor with taxes and troops. Only the territories of the Electors and the Habsburg Archdukes are still excluded from these reforms due to the regal powers they have been granted by the Golden Bull and the Privilegum Maius.

So did Siam and a Shan prince named Mekut'i. Laos won the first round, and Phothisarat placed his son, prince Setthathirat, on the Chiangmai throne. However, the Laotian King died only thirteen months later, and Setthathirat had to hurry to Luang Prabang to claim his father's throne before somebody else did. That gave Siam and the Shans a second chance. All three Kingdoms were fighting over Chiangmai when a revitalized Burma appeared on the scene.;x

King Ramathibodi II (ruled 1491-1529) granted the Portuguese permission to reside and trade within the Kingdom, in return for arms and ammunition.

EVENTNAME120008;Restoration of Thai Independence;x
EVENTHIST120008;Together with his younger brother, Ekatotsarot, Naresuen began to gather armed followers. He had gained an insight into Burmese armed strength and strategies during his formative years. He trained his troops in the art of guerilla warfare and their hit-and-run tactics earned them the nicknames Wild Tigers and Peeping Cats. Naresuen's opportunity to restore Siamese independence came following the death of Bayinnaung, in 1581. Revolts in the Shan states and at Ava were tying young King Nandabayin down at home when Naresuen declared Ayutthaya's freedom, in 1584. During the following nine years, the Burmese made several attempts to resubjugate Siam, but Naresuen had taken thorough defensive measures and repulsed all invasions. On one of these occasions, he killed the Burmese crown prince in single combat, both of them mounted on elephants.;x

He reconsolidated the Siamese Kingdom, then turned the tables on Burma with repeated attacks that contributed to the disintegration of the Burmese empire. The Khmers, who had been whittling away at Siam's eastern boundary during Ayutthaya's period of weakness, were also subdued. Under Naresuen 'the Great,' Ayutthaya prospered and became the thriving metropolis described by 17th century European visitors.;x

EVENTNAME120010;Ekatotsarot;x
EVENTHIST120010;The reign of Naresuen's brother, Ekatotsarot, between 1605 and 1610, coincided with the arrival of the Dutch in Siam. Ekatotsarot was not interested in pursuing Naresuen's militaristic policies. Instead, he sought to develop Ayutthaya's economy. To these ends, he decreed several measures to increase state revenue, among them the introduction of taxes on commerce. This gave him a reputation as a 'covetous man' among Europeans.;x

These mercenaries played an important role in Thai history, when in 1628 they helped the future King Prasat Thong establish himself as regent to a boy-king, and subsequently to depose the rightful leader. Unfortunately, the shogun in Edo (now called Tokyo) refused to recognize him as a Thai monarch, prompting Prasat Thong to take revenge on the Japanese settlement in Ayutthaya. Several Japanese were killed and the rest fled to Cambodia.;x

The importance of Ayutthaya as a trade center increased markedly during this period. Because rare commodities were under state control, they could be procured only from royal warehouses in the capital.;x

EVENTHIST120013;The tranquil days proved to be the calm before the storm. Boromakot's son Ekatat ascended to the throne in 1758, after a bitter succession struggle with his brother, and surrounded himself with a female company to ensure his pleasure. Meanwehile, a village headman united the Third Burmese Empire and assumed the royal title Alaungpaya. His invading Burmese armies were repelled in 1760 after Alaungpaya was wounded by his own cannon. But in 1767, a second Burmese invasion, led by Alaungpaya's son Hsinbyushin, succeeded in capturing Ayutthaya after a siege of fourteen months. In their hurry to withdraw from the conquered capital, the Burmese killed, looted and set fire to the whole city, thereby expunging four centuries of Thai civilization. Showing complete disregard for their common religion, the Buddhist Burmese plundered Ayutthaya's rich temples, melting down all the available gold from Buddha's images. Members of the royal family, along with 90,000 captives and the accumulated booty, were removed to Burma.;x

EVENTNAME120014;Taksin: a Thai Hero;x
EVENTHIST120014;Despite their overwhelming victory, the Burmese didn't retain control of Siam for long. Attacks on Burma's northern borders compelled the Burmese to withdraw most of their forces, and Thai tenacity in rebounding from setback combined to shorten the period of Burmese domination. Giving meaning to an ancient proverb that 'Ayutthaya never lacks good men', a young general named Phya Tak Sin gathered a small band of followers during the final Burmese siege of the Thai capital. He recognized the hoplessness of the Siamese situation under the effete King and his decadent entourage. So instead of waiting for the holocaust to envelop the city, he and his comrades broke through the Burmese encirclement and escaped to Chanthaburi, on the southeast coast of the Gulf of Thailand. There, Phya Tak Sin assembled an army and navy. Seven months after the fall of Ayutthaya, the general and his forces sailed back to the capital and expelled the Burmese occupiers.;x

EVENTHIST120015;The reign of King Boromakot (1733-1758) began with a particularly violent struggle for power, but Baromakot's twenty-five-year term was an unusually peaceful one and became known as Ayutthaya's Golden Age. Poets and artists abounded at hius court, enabling literature and the arts to flourish as never before. During this period, Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) invited a delegation of Siamese monks to purify the Sinhalese Sangha (monkhood), reversing the religious roles of the previous two countries.;x

#;x
EVENTNAME120016;Move to Bangkok;x
EVENTHIST120016;Taksin, as Phya Tak Sin is popularly known, had barely spent a night at Ayutthaya when he decided to transfer the capital. He revealed to his troops that the old Kings had appeared to him in a dream and told him to move. In fact, strategic considerations were probably more important than supernatural ones in Taksin's decision. A site nearer to the sea would facilitate foriegn trade, ensure the procurement of arms, and make defense and withdrawal easier. During the seventeenth century, a small fishing village downstream had become an important trade and defense outpost for Ayutthaya. Known as Bangkok, 'village of wild olive groves,' it contained fortifications built by the French. The settlement straddled both sides of the Chao Phrya River, at a place where a short-cut canal had widened into the main stream. on the west bank, at Thonburi, Taksin officially established his new capital and was proclaimed King.;x

EVENTNAME120018;Capture of the Emerald Buddha;x
EVENTHIST120018;It was from the victorious Laotian campaign that Thailand obtained the famed Emerald Buddha. Chao Phya Chakri carried the Buddha from Vientiane to Thonburi in 1779. Carved of solid jadeite, the image was allegedly discovered at Chiang Rai, in 1436, inside a pagoda struck asunder by lightning. The Emerald Buddha is regarded by Thais as the most sacred of all Buddha images, and is believed to guarantee the independence and prosperity of the nation.;x

EVENTNAME120019;Chakri Day;x
EVENTHIST120019;Convinced he was the future Buddha, King Taksin attempted to force the Buddhist monkhood and his subjects to accept his religious pretensions. This led to a rebellion and Taksin was deposed on the grounds of insanity. Following his deposition in 1782, Chao Phya Chakri, born as Thong Duang, was chosen as the new King. He came to the throne on the 6th of April 1782, becoming the founder and first ruler of the present Chakri Dynasty.;x

EVENTHIST120020;With his advisor Constance Phaulkon, The King of Siam, Phra Naraï, hoped that the vicinity of the French would hold in respect the Dutchmen who had already the quasi-monopoly of the traffic in the Far East. Consolidated in his hopes by the Nimègue peace of 1678, relatively openminded man, he treated well the French monks and the tradesmen of the 'Compagnie Française des Indes Orientales' present in his Kingdom. As of the end of 1680, he sent an embassy in Europe which carried present and letters to the Pope and Louis XIV. But it sank towards the island of Madagascar with the ship which transported it. In the beginning of 1684, Phra Naraï then sent a new mission in France which reached the court of the Sun King.;x

Arrived in October, Chaumont vainly tried to convert Phra Naraï to Catholicism and refused to sign the political treaty that Siam awaited. Two months later, Chaumont left the country for France, accompanied by a Siamese mission, and leaving Forbin as High Admiral and chief of the Siamese armies. In March 1687, a French embassy, with Simon de la Loubère and Céberet de Boullay as leaders, left on the vessels named 'le Gaillard' et 'l'Oiseau'. 630 infantry men, under the command of Desfarges, embarked on four other ships.

Phaulkon was assassinated in June and Phra Naraï died mysteriously. Pitracha, the instigator of this revolution, became King, whereas French did not move.

Some of the plagues, like Smallpox had been identified by their horrible symptoms, while others remained as silent killers. The effect was devastating, and between 50 and 80 percent of the original native population was killed by several waves of diseases that swept the continent in the next 200 years. These plagues certainly played an important role in the easy conquest of the continent by Europeans, and in the aculturalization of the natives.

EVENTHIST410002;Ruling as much from the saddle as from his throne, Ahmad Shah moved the Bahmanid capital from Gulbarga to Bidar, closer to the southeastern frontier where Ahmad was campaigning against the Hindu chiefs. This move was designed primarily for defense, built 2,500 feet above sea level, but was also an administrative move, since the area around Gulbarga was proving resistant to Bahmanid administration.;x

The various provincial governors were virtually independent but maintained the fiction of a unified empire to prevent foreign encroachments. This status quo was destroyed in 1486, when the governor of Warangal died and Qiwam-ul-Mulk, then governor of Rajamundari annexed the entire Telingana region. While the Prime Minister's son, Malik Ahmad, was off combating the rebellious governor, provincial governor, Yusuf Adil abetted rebels in uprisings in Dabul, Kolhapur and Goa which largely undermined the authority of Malik Hasan. As a result, the prime minister's friends turned against him, taking his life by chopping off his head. His death provoked a series of battles between the Decanni and Foreigner parties, ending in many Decannis being put to the sword or fleeing into the countryside. All of these events suggested to the provincial governors that the end was near and thus they began to assert their autonomy in their respective jurisdictions.;x

Although he was to rule successfully and efficently for the next 4 years of the Sultan's minority, Hasan also took the opportunity to strike blows to the Foreigners. In particular, Hasan was out to destroy the then leader of the rival faction, Yusuf Adil Khan, govenor of Bijapur. Turning the Sultan against the Foreigner faction, orders were sent out to punish the foreigners for their insolence. The gates of the city were closed and for the next 20 days bloody conflict ensued that ended with over 8,000 dead.

Prussia intervened in July 1778 in what she saw as a dangerous Austrian expansion. It was a short conflict which started with a Prussian invasion of Bohemia but was terminated in May 1779s when Empress Maria Theresa forced her son Joseph II to capitulate.

In this law exact prices and taxation for all known kinds of beer, and most importantly, the allowed contents of Bavarian beer are regulated. The Duke allowed to put nothing but water, malt and hops into beer, intending to make sure that there would be no more additional spices and, especially, no 'good' grain that could be used for bread instead in the beverage. Yeast, although an obviously necessary ingredient, was not mentioned because it was not known then that it took part in the fermentation process (the substance was discovered in the 19th century by Louis Pasteur). The beer law soon raised the quality standard of beer significantly and it became exemplary for the whole of Germany. Many German princes adapted a similar regulation in the next centuries.

EVENTNAME125011;Aventinus, the father of Bavarian historiography;x
EVENTHIST125011;Johannes Turmair, calling himself Aventinus, born in Abensberg in 1477 was the father of Bavarian historiography. A humanist with universal education who studied in Ingolstadt, Krakow, Vienna and Paris, he was called to the Bavarian court as mentor of the princes Ernst and Ludwig in 1509. In 1517 he was given the noble office of a ducal historian. In 1521 he had completed the Annales ducum baiorum, a complete account of Bavarian history in which he applied an entirely new style based on humanist ideas: he did not only compile sources like medieval historians, but introduced a critical analysis of sources, questioned famous myths and legends and tried to work out greater contexts. Even more important than the completion of his innovative historic work in Latin was its translation into German that he started in 1522 because he wanted his history of Bavaria to be comprehensible for the people, not just for some scholars (thereby following the humanist concept of popular education). However, the Annales could not be made accessible to a broader public by printing them for a long time due to Aventine's critical, anticlerical point of view and the suspicion of being protestant. The venetian inquisition put his teachings on the index in 1554 and Aventinus himself was arrested for some months in 1527, after which he emigrated to the safe free city of Regensburg where he wrote the town history 'Von dem herkomen der statt Regenspurg' (about the origins of the town of Regensburg), completed the germanisation of his Bavarian chronicle and died in 1533.

EVENTHIST125017;In the protestant imperial city of Donauwörth adjacent to Bavaria there were only a few catholic families left in 1600 who celebrated their masses in the benedictine monastery Zum Heiligen Kreuz. Encouraged by the Bishop of Augsburg the monks used to make the Procession of St. Marc a big demonstration of Catholicism and marched through the town with banners and music. The protestant citizens felt provoked by this behaviour and attacked and dissolved the procession in 1607. Even after the Reichshofrat in Vienna had condemned the action and demanded tolerance for catholics, Donauwörth remained stubborn. As a consequence, emperor Rudolf outlawed the town and asked Maximilian of Bavaria to execute the empire's will. For Maximilian, this was a long-awaited opportunity to annex the wealthy town and to promote Catholicism. He went to Donauwörth with 5000 men and forced it to submit on December 17th 1607. A bavarian administration was installed and the recatholisation of the town initiated. In 1609 the emperor formally accepted the annexation of Donauwörth, and within a few years there were nearly no more protestants left in the town. The seizure of Donauwörth was one of the main reasons for the foundation of the Evangelic Union (and hence the Thirty Years War).;x

In the battle of the White Mountain Bohemia was reconquered, and the protestant nobles who had dared to depose Ferdinand of Austria as Bohemian King were punished severely, their land was given to Catholics and a consequent persecution of Protestants began. To penalize Friedrich V of the Palatinate and to reward Maximilian of Bavaria, Ferdinand deprived Friedrich of his electorate and of the Upper Palatinate and granted both to Bavaria, which was an obvious violation of imperial law, but since no German prince was really in a position to defy Ferdinand and Maximilian, it was done and Maximilian had achieved a recognition proportionate to his power.;x

Their goal was not to incorporate the ideas of the Enlightenment, but to consolidate Bavaria after its devastating defeat in the War of Austrian Succession. Nevertheless, Kreittmayr managed to establish some enlightened concepts, such as an inner logic of the laws, the desire to apply them without discriminating between social classes and the use of the German language instead of latin. After passing the Codex iuris Bavarici criminalis, the criminal law, in 1751 and the Codex iuris Bavarici iudicarii, the reorganisation of the jurisdiction, in 1753, the most important part of the new legislation, the Codex Maximilianeus Bavarici civilis which took care of the civil law, was enacted on January 2nd 1756.

EVENTHIST125024;Maximilian Josef Garnerin Count of Montgelas, a noble from Savoy, dominated Bavarian politics as Minister of Foreign Affairs, of Finances and of Domestic Affairs during the Napoleonic era and made it a much stronger, modern state. He was an unscrupulous, pragmatic politician and a supporter of Enlightenment. Under his influence, Bavaria betrayed the empire and allied with Napoléon, acquired territories from the Church (Würzburg and Salzburg) and from the defeated Habsburgs (Tirol and parts of Swabia) and eventually became a Kingdom in 1806. In order to strengthen the royal authority and to assimilate the new possessions, Montgelas introduced several reforms of the administration's organisation, competences and personal that have strongly affected Bavaria throughout his whole further history. Thus, he is considered the creator of modern Bavaria, although he always remained a stranger to the country and did not really understand its inhabitants or any nationalist sentiments that would have kept Bavaria away from an alliance with Napoléon.;x

EVENTHIST125025;By the Treaty of Lunéville of 1801 the empire formally ceded everything left of the Rhine to Napoleonic France. With the princes who thereby lost territory demanding a compensation and the empire disintegrating, it was evident that the empire would need to be drastically reformed. Negotiations began in 1802, and victorious France soon tried to influence them, in order to strengthen the medium powers like Bavaria, Württemberg, Baden and Hessen to be counterweights against Austria and Prussia. On February 25th an agreement was reached, the two most important decisions were the Mediatisation of all free cities except for Bremen, Hamburg, Lübeck, Frankfurt, Augsburg and Nürnberg and of most small independent principalities and the Secularisation of almost all church possessions in the empire. The big countries in Southern Germany that France wanted to ally with, Bavaria, Württemberg and Baden, massively increased their territories. Bavaria received the bishoprics of Würzburg, Bamberg and Augsburg, several abbeys and twelve former imperial cities.;x

EVENTHIST125026;Maximilian Josef and his minister Montgelas, who both had an enlightened, anti-clerical attitude and believed in the necessity of drastic reforms from above, desired to make Bavaria an internally strong, homogenous and progressive state. After short, difficult discussions with the still powerful Bavarian estates they decided to just ignore the estates, and to gradually reduce their privileges, thus extending the Elector's power and central bureaucracy. Also, Montgelas reformed the education system, improved measurements and began the systematic dispossession of the clerus and the secularisation of administration and laws. These steps were not very well received by the rather conservative populace and especially the church, and resistance against them emerged.;x

EVENTNAME125027;The Kingdom of Bavaria;x
EVENTHIST125027;Montgelas, being a secret supporter of the revolution's ideas and an astute politician, seeked Napoleonic France's friendship with the goal to make Bavaria a first-rate-power at the expense of the small neighbouring principalities and especially Austria. He pursued this policy with determination and consumate skill, and achieved great successes by the Deputation of the Empire in 1803 and even more by the Peace of Pressburg signed between Napoléon and Austria. In this humiliating treaty Austria accepted the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire, ceded large territories to France and Bavaria - almost all of Tyrol, the principality of Eichstädt, the margraviate of Burgau, the lordship of Vorarlberg, the countships of Hohenems and Konigsegg-Rothenfels, the lordships of Argen and Tetnang, and the city of Lindau with its territory were to be added to Bavaria - and allowed the promotion of several German allies of Napoléon to new ranks. The last was the most important term for Bavaria, since it finally gained the possibility of royal honours that so many Bavarian electors had failed to obtain before. The price which the new King Maximilian had reluctantly to pay for this triumph was the marriage of his daughter Augusta with Eugene Beauharnais and the accession to the Rhine Confederacy.;x

The revolutionary constitution of May 1st 1808 can be considered his, greatest political achievement, introducing equality before the law, universal liability to taxation, abolition of serfdom, liberty of conscience, and some individual constitutional safeguards in all of Bavaria. In this code, Montgelas also, expanded Bavarian laws and administration to all new territories, including also Tyrol that had always enjoyed some autonomy, under Austrian rule.

EVENTNAME125030;The Grand Alliance;x
EVENTHIST125030;For years Europe has been preparing for the death of childless Carlos II of Spain. He was related to several royal families in Europe, but after the death of the designated heir, Joseph Ferdinand Wittelbach of Bavaria, at the age of six, the royal houses of Austria and France had a similar claim. But both were too powerful, and the addition of the Spanish empire would make any of them unstoppable, and so candidates not destined to their thrones, Philip of Anjou and Charles Habsburg, were discussed as heirs to Carlos, and several partition agreements were negotiated. That is precisely what everybody wanted to prevent in Spain. A will was redacted and the agonizing Carlos signed it. It left the Kingdom to Philip Anjou, but it contained two crucial clauses, the condition that the crowns of France and Spain should never be held by the same person and that the Spanish possessions could not be divided. Austria, of course, rejected it, but the rest of Europe seemed to agree, as the equilibrium was not broken. But Louis misjudged the uneasiness that the rest of Europe displayed for the French expansionism, and made several mistakes after the Spanish succession. He closed the Spanish-American commerce to the English and the Dutch, he recognized James III Stuart as King of England, and French troops occupied the fortresses in Spanish Netherlands. In February, the French States had ratified the right of Philip of Anjou to the crown of France, violating the will of Carlos II. The maritime powers had the motive and the excuse, and Austria discovered that now she had allies for the war of Spanish succession. The only allies of France were the Wittelsbach: the electors of Bavaria, Cologne and Trier, and the Duke of Savoy. Maximilian II of Bavaria had been named governor of the Spanish Netherlands. The Bavarian participation in the war lasted until the battle of Blenheim in 1704, when she was knocked out of the war by a crushing defeat.;x

So, upon the death of Karl of Habsburg, Karl Albert of Wittelsbach should have been elected Emperor and legitimatedly proclaimed Archduke of Austria and King of Bohemia.

With financial help from the King of Denmark, he went on to set up an observatory on the island of Hveen in Copenhagen Sund. The observatory, called Uraniborg, was equipped with exceptionally large and accurate instruments. At Uraniborg Tycho made twenty years' worth of astronomical observations. After quarrelling with the King of Denmark, Tycho closed down his observatory and sought a place for himself and his instruments at various courts.

EVENTNAME129000;The first defenestration of Prague;x
EVENTHIST129000;Religious dissent in Bohemia, caused by the low moral state of the clergy and the great schism, had grown slowly in the 14th century. It found a leading figure in Jan Hus, a priest and professor of theology at the university of Prague. Influenced by the teachings of John Wyclif, he developed several reformatory demands, including the administration of the communion in both kinds to all church members, a much stricter adhesion to the bible and the Commandments, a radical reformation of the clergy and the abolition of Papal infallibility. These views were attacked as heretic by the University of Prague in 1403, however since he enjoyed the protection of the King he could continue to spread them and even became rector of the university. In 1410, when his influence had grown significantly and he had gathered already a large amount of followers, the Archbishop of Prague excommunicated him, which did not stop him from teaching his ideas and increasing what had soon become a popular movement, though. In 1414 he was summoned to the Council of Constance to justify his views, having been guaranteed safe-conduct by Emperor Sigismund. Ignoring this safe-conduct, the Council condemned him as a heretic and had him burned at the stake. Thereby he became a martyr for the Bohemians and his views became even more popular.;x

His brother, Emperor Sigismund, immediately claimed the throne and was acknowledged as rightful heir by the crown lands and by the remaining catholics in Bohemia, mostly in the crown lands Moravia, Silesia and Lusatia where there still was a catholic majority, however the Hussites who at that time already dominated most of Bohemia proper refused to accept him, fearing suppression of their faith and despising him for his betrayal of Jan Hus that led to his execution at the stake in 1415. Armed resistance against royal authority and violence against Romanists, especially Germans, began almost immediately. Queen Sophia, widow of Vaclav, first acted as regent in Bohemia and tried to maintain at least a bit of central authority in Prague and to secure the throne for her brother-in-law, however she was opposed by the Hussites in Prague and had few effective control over Bohemia. On November 13th, she had to conclude a truce with thecitizens of Prague, having failed to suppress them with hired mercenaries, basically acknowledging that the Hussite movement had become impossible to control, let alone suppress it. For almost two decades large parts of Bohemia would be in Hussite hands.;x

It is evident that the radicals among them need to be persecuted harshly, but there are also, especially among the nobility, lots of moderates, the so-called Utraquists. If we decide to suppress them as well, we would cleanse Bohemia completely from heresy and strengthen the authority of the catholic King, on the other hand, this might make many Hussites leave the country which would weaken the country's military and economic strength substantially. Therefore some of the King's advisors advocate giving certain concessions to the Romanists.;x

Having faced this for some time, Sigismund had chosen his longtime ally and friend Albrecht of Austria, who had proven to be a capable soldier during the Hussite Wars, as his successor in all three Kingdoms and married him to his sole daughter Elizabeth. The last years of his reign were almost exclusively dedicated to ensuring the succession. He eventually got Bohemia to accept Albrecht, however when Albrecht rose to the Bohemian throne after Sigismund's death, a part of the Utraquist nobility and the remaining Taborites stood up in revolt against him, dissatisfied with Sigismund's reign, afraid of the Compactata being ignored and leery of German influence.

EVENTHIST129004;In 1439 Albrecht of Habsburg, King of Hungary, fell ill, probably of cholera, while campaigning against the Ottomans. Within one month he died, leaving two minor daughters and his pregnant wife Elizabeth. For the case of the unborn child being male, Albrecht declared that his son would be his successor in all his fiefs just before his death. Upon his death, the Bohemian nobility formed two conflicting parties. The 'national' one, led by George of Podiebrad and consistingmainly of Utraquist Hussites,insisted on Bohemia's right to elect its King and a strict adherence to the Compactates thatguaranteed religious freedom to the moderate Hussite. Remembering the Jagiellons' support for the Hussite rebels and preferring a Slavic monarch to a German one, they wanted to offer the Bohemian throne to the Polish prince Casimir. Opposedto them was the 'Romanist' or 'Austrian' party under Oldrich of Rozmberk that acknowledged the hereditary rights of Albrecht's unborn child and advocated a return to the Roman church. The two parties finally came to an agreement calledthe 'Letter of Peace'. In this treaty both parties recognized the validity of the compacts, confirmed the appointment of Jan of Rokycan, a moderate Utraquist, as Bishop of Prague against the will of the Pope, and agreed on a compromise regarding the succession of Albrecht. The Nationalists abandoned the candidature of Casimir, but pressed their demand for an adult King -which was in the interest of most Romanists who did not want to be ruled by a baby as well. Thus the throne was offered to Duke Albrecht of Bavaria-Munich.;x

On February 22nd 1440, Queen Elizabeth gave birth to a son who received the name of Ladislaus and eventually rose to the thrones of Bohemia and Hungary.

Meanwhile Bohemia still lacked a regular government, the struggle between Nationalists and Romanists broke out again and threatened to turn into civil war. In order to save the country from falling into anarchy, the estates of Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia and Lusatia were summoned for a general meeting in 1446. This diet attempted to establish an effective administration of the Kingdom for as long as its King was a child. It was decreed that the members of the estates were to be divided into three bodies, the 'curiae', representing the nobles, the knights and the towns - who were granted such a big deal of influence for the first time - that deliberated separately and only met for a final decision in which each of the three had one vote.

He assembled a considerable army in Kutna Hora, marched to Prague and seized the town almost without resistance. Having put himself in control of most of the country and enjoying popular support, he assumed the regency over the Kingdom. While both the Diet and the young King's guardian Friedrich III sanctioned his title in 1451, the Romanists and the few remaining fanatic Taborites violently opposed him.;x

Although there was a number of foreign candidates, it was obvious that the only possible choice was the most powerful and most popular man in Bohemia: George of Podiebrad. On February 27th 1458 the estates unanimously elected him, with even his Romanist enemies, voting for Podiebrad. The election was enthusiastically welcomed by the populace. Podiebrad soon began to restore order, to consolidate his authority and to revive the economy. Thus the first years of his reign seemed quite prosperous and Bohemia, likely to return to the power within the Empire it had enjoyed during the reign of Charles IV. The Romanists however, continued to oppose him and secretly conspired against Podiebrad with the Pope.;x

EVENTHIST129013;The more moderate wing of the Hussites of Bohemia had been granted limited religious freedom in 1436 by the Compactates and since then practiced its faith openly in Bohemia, tolerated by the Catholic church. When Pius II rose to the holy see, he was determined to end this situation. He got George of Podiebrad who was a Hussite himself to promise converting to catholicism and suppressing all heresy in Bohemia just before his election in 1458. Podiebrad however, while indeed planning to return to the Roman Church himself, had no intention to persecute his former coreligionists and insisted on the Compactates. As a reaction, on March 31st 1462 Pius declared that the Compactates had been valid only for the generation that lived back then and were now invalid and demanded Bohemia's full return to catholicism. At an assembly of the estates in Prague, George refused and said he would to his death remain true to the communion of both kinds, and that he was ready to risk his life and his crown in defense of his faith.;x

EVENTHIST129014;After George's refusal of the church's demands to suppress the Hussite faith in 1462 the Romanist party in Bohemia became even more embittered against the King whom they regarded both as a heretic and as a political enemy who was about to curtail the nobility's privileges. At a meeting in Zelena Hora on November 28th 1465 most of them formed a confederacy championed by Zdenek of Sternberg against him and began open revolt. The lands of the crown, Silesia, Moravia and Lusatia, that were almost entirely catholic opposed George most strongly. He completely lost control of these lands to the Catholics after the formation of the confederacy. While the Royalists obtained some successes in Bohemia and quickly seized all castles held by the rebels there, they failed in Silesia, Moravia and Lusatia.

After Friedrich II of Brandenburg's refusal to champion the campaign, Pius turned to Matthias Corvinus of Hungary. Betraying his former ally Podiebrad, Matthias accepted and invaded Moravia. The supporters of Podiebrad successfully prevented him from entering Hungary, but the lands of the Bohemian crown all fell to the King of Hungary.

Vladislav indeed succeeded him and initiated a half century of Jagiellon rule in Bohemia which proved to be backwards, intolerant in religious matters, devastating for Bohemia's economy and eventually resulted in the disaster of 1526.

EVENTNAME129025;The Letter of Peace;x
EVENTHIST129025;In 1439 Albrecht of Habsburg, King of Hungary, fell ill, probably of cholera, while campaigning against the Ottomans. Within one month he died, leaving two minor daughters and his pregnant wife Elizabeth. For the case of the unborn child being male, Albrecht declared that his son would be his successor in all his fiefs just before his death. Upon his death, the Bohemian nobility formed two conflicting parties. The 'national' one, led by George of Podiebrad and consistingmainly of Utraquist Hussites,insisted on Bohemia's right to elect its King and a strict adherence to the Compactates thatguaranteed religious freedom to the moderate Hussite. Remembering the Jagiellons' support for the Hussite rebels and preferring a Slavic monarch to a German one, they wanted to offer the Bohemian throne to the Polish prince Casimir. Opposedto them was the 'Romanist' or 'Austrian' party under Ulrich of Rozmberk that acknowledged the hereditary rights of Albrecht's unborn child and advocated a return to the Roman church. The two parties finally came to an agreement calledthe 'Letter of Peace'. In this treaty both parties recognized the validity of the compacts, confirmed the appointment of Jan of Rokycan, a moderate Utraquist, as Bishop of Prague against the will of the Pope, and agreed on a compromise regarding the succession of Albrecht. The Nationalists abandoned the candidature of Casimir, but pressed their demand for an adult King -which was in the interest of most Romanists who did not want to be ruled by a baby as well. Thus the throne was offered to Albrecht of Wittelsbach who eagerly accepted, having lost his hereditary possession of Bavaria-Munich.;x

EVENTHIST129026;Even after the death of Jiri Podiebrad and the election of Vladislav Jagiello, warfare between Bohemia and Matthias Corvinus of Hungary who maintained his claim to the Bohemian throne continued. Despite Polish support for Bohemia, no side eventually managed to gain the upper hand: while Matthias failed in all his attempts to invade Bohemia proper and was threatened by Hungarian rebels and Friedrich III, the lands of the Bohemian crown, Silesia, Moravia and Lusatia, were almost completely occupied by him and could, despite several determined attacks, never be recovered. Realizing this, and desiring to secure their positions, both parties agreed on a peace in Olmütz which came into effect in 1478. By the treaty, Corvinus was to retain the lands of the Bohemian crown until his death when Bohemia could buy them back for 400.000 Florins and was allowed to style himself King of Bohemia in these lands, but gave up his claim on the rest of Bohemia.;x

EVENTNAME129028;Reactionary policies;x
EVENTHIST129028;When getting elected King as a 15-year-old in 1471, Vladislav II had several promises to the Bohemian emissaries, including the absolute maintenance of the Compactata and supporting the Utraquist Archbishop of Prague Jan Rokycan. Therefore his election had been regarded as a victory of the Nationalists and Hussites who trusted in him to protect their religious freedom and national autonomy. Their hopes were soon disappointed: while indeed remaining officially faithful to the Compactata, he secretly promoted catholicism. His government officials were only part of the section of the Hussites closest to Rome and always willing to accept compromises with the Church while all Hussite extremists, especially the recently emerged Bohemian Brethren, were persecuted harshly. Among the Hussites, these policies caused massive dissent and unrest. In Prague, several riots took place and the city hall was stormed by radical Hussites. In order to protect their interest they considered endangered by the King, Hussite nobles began to organize themselves in a league again, openly acting against the King.;x

EVENTHIST129029;After a decade of unrest and decay of central authority, a meeting of all Bohemian estates at Kutna Hora in 1485 managed to restore peace and stability. Catholics and Hussites agreed to tolerate each other's faith, promised to refrain from violence and formally confirmed the Compactata. While the imminent threat of a civil war had been prevented, the decision - in which King Vladislav had not participated - meant a further reduction of royal authority.;x

EVENTNAME129030;Establishment of serfdom;x
EVENTHIST129030;A decree issued by Vladislav II in 1487 under the pressure of the high nobility established serfdom in Bohemia. This dealt a devastating blow to the military and economic strength of the country, and its free peasantry had been the backbone of both its prosperous economy and especially the superior armies of the Hussite leaders and Jiri Podiebrad. The King became dependent completely on support from the nobility through feudal levy, loosing the greatest advantage he had enjoyed over his neighbours.;x

EVENTNAME129032;Regulations of King Vladislav;x
EVENTHIST129032;During his reign, the incompetent and weak King Vladislav allowed the nobility to gradually recover the privileges they had lost during the Hussite wars and under Jiri Podiebrad and more, negating the social and political development of the last century. The King could only obtain funds with the consent of the high nobility, and the rights granted to the townsmen before were entirely abolished. Those changes were definitely codified in a decree called the 'Regulations of King Vladislav' issued in 1500. While it confirmed and increased the rights and influence of the nobles and the knights, it ignored those of the burghers. The towns were no longer represented in diets and virtually helpless against encroachments from the nobility. Great discord among the towns was the logical consequence.;x

As their head they chose Prince Bartolomej of Münsterberg, grandson and legitimate successor of Jiri Podiebrad. They recruited an army and put themselves in charge of the surroundings of their city areas, resisting the nobility and royal authority.;x

EVENTNAME129034;Diet of St. Wenceslas;x
EVENTHIST129034;After several years of severe instability and unrest due to the towns' resistance against the abolition of their rights and constant feuding between rival parties among the nobility, the estates, including the towns, convened on the anniversary of Wenceslas, national saint of Bohemia, September 28th 1517. At that meeting, soon known as the 'Diet of St. Wenceslas', they finally managed to achieve a settlement regarding the issues that had been dividing Bohemia. In exchange for renouncing several old privileges, the towns had their most important rights, municipal autonomy and a place in the diet, confirmed again by the nobility. The three estates agreed to 'live together in friendly intercourse, as men belonging to the same country and race'. The compromise achieved at the diet was of outstanding significance for Bohemia's further constitutional history. Besides, the diet also confirmed the regency of the supreme burgrave Zdenek Leo of Rozmital and limited the influence of the minor King Ludvik and his guardians to a minimum.;x

EVENTNAME129035;Arrival of King Ludvik;x
EVENTHIST129035;When his father Vladislav II died, Ludvik II was only 10 years old and received Maximilian of Austria and Sigismund of Poland as guardians. Bohemia was left to the control of its great nobles, with the supreme burgrave Zdenek Leo of Rozmital having put himself effectively in charge of the country. When in 1522 Ludvik visited Bohemia for the first time, he immediately dismissed all Bohemian state officials, including Rozmital, intending to increase his authority in the country. He appointed Karel of Münsterberg as royal regent during his absence and Jan of Wartenberg as supreme burgrave.;x

EVENTHIST129036;The new officials appointed by King Ludvik in 1522, Karel of Münsterberg and Jan of Wartenberg, were supporters of the advanced Hussites who also seemed to show some sympathy for the teachings of Luther. There were even rumours of them planning to seize power, convert the country officially to Lutheranism and make Karel, who was a grandson of Jiri Podiebrad and his successor to the Duchy of Münsterberg, national King. Although these were unconfirmed and probably created by their enemies, their sympathy for heresy was enough for Ludvik, who at that time was hoping for support from the Pope against the Ottomans, to dismiss them and restore Zdenek Leo of Rozmital in his offices as regent and supreme burgrave.;x

EVENTHIST129037;Shortly after being restored to his offices, Zdenek Leo of Rozmital renewed his family's old feud with the Rozmberks, trying to take advantage of his new powers. The feud between the country's two most powerful dynasties made the already unstable situation turn suddenly into civil war. Most of the nobles and cities of Bohemia took sides, often hoping to settle their private conflicts in the process. Meanwhile, Hungary which was also ruled by King Ludvik was being invaded by the Ottomans and he sent a desperate plea for help to his Bohemian subjects. While the Rozmberks and their supporters granted the help, intending to gain the King's support, the members of the Rozmital faction purposefully delayed sending their forces.;x

Ladislaus' closest relative, Emperor Frederick III, insists on the dynastic principle and claims to be rightful heir. While such a union with Austria is indeed rather popular among those who have already supported Albrecht of Habsburg and before the Luxemburg Kings, the idea is opposed by the powerful former regent Oldrich z Rozmberka who now sees his own chance on the throne.;x

EVENTNAME3873;The Bogumil Heresy;x
EVENTHIST3873;The Bogumils were a Christian sect that believed in Dualism. Their teachings had their origin in teachings of early Paulician churches in Asia Minor and in Manicheanism. While Manicheanists believed in two Gods, one evil and one good (violating the Christian view of monotheism), Bogumils believed in one God with two sides, one evil and one good. Satan was the older brother of Jesus and thus as much God as Jesus is. God's evil side (Satanael) was ruling the material world while God's good side was ruling the spiritual world. Thus they believed that all churches were the work of Satanel, so they rejected them. They also rejected the Old Testament, priests' ownership of material things and church sacraments. Because of this they were usually supported by the Bans and Kings of Bosnia. With the Ottoman conquest of Bosnia, most of the Bogumils converted to Islam.;x

In 1424, a small Ottoman army raided Bosnia as a warning, but this didn't change Tvrtko's mind much. In 1425, Tvrtko II started negotiations with Emperor Sigismund to join the league against Ottomans. He agreed to Sigismund's demand to name Count Hermann of Cilli, one of most powerful Hungarian nobles, as his heir. The alliance with Hungary was delayed, however, because of Hungarian failures against Hussites in Bohemia. After punishing Serbia for dealing with Hungarians, Ottomans sent another raiding expedition into Bosnia in 1426. Determined to ally with Hungary, Tvrtko II named Hermann of Cilli heir to the Bosnian throne if Tvrtko dies without a heir or his heir dies without one.

EVENTHIST130008;Kingdom of Bosnia was a chaotic realms where dukes constantly battle each other for territories. The most famous rivalry of that age was between Pavlovic and Kosaca families. After a quiet period, the rivalry revived when Duke Radoslav Pavlovic attacked and defeated the Republic of Ragusa because they tried to turn Cavtat, a town they bought from him, into a fortress. Duke Sandalj Hranic Kosaca immediately intervened on Ragusan side and attacked his archrival. King Tvrtko II was mostly helpless to solve the dispute. Since Duke Sandalj had the support of the Ottomans, Duke Radoslav asked Despot Djuradj of Serbia to broker peace. At almost the same time, King Tvrtko II went to war with Zlatonosovic family in eastern Bosnia. Since they were friends of Duke Sandalj and Serbian Despot, King Tvrtko II decided to throw his lot with Duke Radoslav. A real civil war started in Bosnia. As Kings faction began to loose the war, treacherous Duke Radoslav switched sides and joined the Serbian Despot's camp in 1433. This coalition of Serbian Despot and Bosnian Dukes put forth their own candidate for Tvrtko's replacement: Radivoj. The hostilities temporarily ceased when Emperor Sigismund announced his support for King Tvrtko II and Despot Djuradj withdrew from the conflict. Hungarian army arrived as promised in 1434 and changed the tide of the battle. Coalition of rebellious Dukes was defeated and forts held by Ottomans liberated. Duke Sandalj was crushed by Duke Djuradj Vojsalic, who joined forces with King Tvrtko II when Hugarian army arrived, and died from illness in March 1435. King Tvrtko traveled to Hungarty to swear vassalage to Emperor Sigismund. Upon his return to Bosnia, he started a campaign together with Duke Radoslav Pavlovic to destroy Stepan Vukcic, the new Duke Kosaca. King Tvtrko II was also aided by Croatian Prinecs Ivan and Stepan Frankopan who acted on the orders of Emperor Sigismund. Ottomans intervened on the behalf of Stepan Vukcic and reconquered one of the forts in Bosnia holding it against Hungarian troops until the end of the conflict. In 1436, Ivan Frankopan is denied the succession of the estates that belonged to his late father-in-law and switches sides to join Duke Stepan Vukcic. Hungarian army defeated and probably killed Ivan Frankopan. King Tvrtko II realized that he will not be able to expel the Turks from Bosnia and crush Stepan Vukcic, so he renewed his oath to Ottoman Sultan and reconciled with his enemy. Together with Stepan Vukcic and the Ottoman forces, the King turned on Duke Radoslav and utterly defeated him in 1438. It is said that around 16 monasteries and churches were burned during this civil war, and this is only a part of the devastation that was caused.;x

Stepan Vukcic had claims on Zeta as husband of Jelena, daughter of late Balsa III, the last ruler of independent Zeta. He attacked Zeta while Serbia was being conquered by his Ottoman allies, gaining support of rebellious local Crnojevic family. The last Serbian stronghold in Zeta fell to Stepan Vukcic in 1441, just after the mining town of Novo Brdo fell to Ottomans. Stepan was stopped by Venetian towns in lower Zeta. Agitated by Serbian Despot Djuradj, most Montenegrins joined with Venetian defenders. Only citizens of Bar supported the Bosnian Duke. Stepan was temporarily force to halt his attack on Zeta in 1442 because of rebellion of his closes cousin, Ivan Vukovic, but resumed his operations later in the year. His army was immediately defeated near Bar but Venetians refused to negotiate peace treaty while he still held the town. In December 1442, however, Stepan Vukcic was more successful and made progress all the way to Scutari in the east of Zeta. Duke Stepan was joined by Ottoman troops from Albania in 1443 and also by Montenegrin tribes of Patrovici and Zacani, but he lost the town of Bar in June that year. In need of naval support, Stepan Vukcic sought help from King Alfons V of Aragon of from Republic of Genoa, archrivals of Venice. He failed to procure aid, however, and lost more towns to Venice in the process. In 1444, Stevan Crnojevic, leader of the rebellious Crnojevic family, betrayed Stepan Vukcic and joned the Venetians.

This gave no military support to Tomas, however, only repaired his reputation with the nobels and alienated him from the people of Bosnia.;x

EVENTNAME130017;Peace with Duke Stepan Vukcic;x
EVENTHIST130017;Duke Stepan Vukcic was facing defeats both against Venice and against King Tomas. King Tomas might have crushed Duke Stepan at the moment, but faced with the prospect of Aragonese inheritance and the idea that Alfons V might want to connect Hungary to Naples through Bonsia and Dalmatia, he sought peace with his most powerful Duke. It was made in May 1446 and crowned with Duke Stepan's marriage to Tomas' daughter Katarina.;x

EVENTNAME130018;Betrayal of Duke Stepan Vukcic;x
EVENTHIST130018;Ottoman Empire attacked Bosnia in March 1448. Having no hope of victory against the more powerful foe, Duke Stepan Vukcic betrayed King Tomas and joined forces with Despot of Serbia to defeat him near Srebrenica in September. To crown this victory, Stepan Vukcic declared himself Herceg of Saint Sava. Herceg is a title of Hungarian origin which he saw as higher than Duke, but he also adopted it to connect himself with the Orthodox cult of Saint Sava which was very popular among the lower class population. His lands are even today called Hercegovina after this title. King Tomas attempted to outmaneuver Herceg Stepan by asking the Pope to excommunicate him, even at the cost of giving all Stepan's lands to the church, but Rome was well aware that Stepan Vukcic was the greater supporter of Catholicism in Bosnia.;x

In 1450, Pope Nicolaus V declared that anyone who fights in Tomas' army in defense and against his enemies will be absolved of all sins. As the enemies of King Tomas, he defined not only muslims but also schismatics and heretics (Orthodox and Bogumil Christians). King Tomas, however, made a mistake and tried to use his new soldiers against his internal enemies, forcing many would-be conscripts to flee into lands of Herceg Stepan Vukcic.;x

EVENTHIST130020;In December 1451, King Tomas signed a pact with Republic of Ragusa in Bobovac. In exchange for financial aid, King Tomas agreed to cede small parts of Herceg's lands to the Republic when he is defeated. The timing for an invasion was great as Herceg Stepan was greatly weakened by a conflict with his son Vladislav. However, it was delayed first by Ottoman arbiter sent by the Sultan, then by Venetian attack on Ragusa. King Tomas beat back the Venetian invaders and rescued Ragusa, but didn't take any actions against Herceg, fearful of Ottoman or Serbian invasion. General tension and loosing conflict with his own son forced Herceg Stepan to surrender in July 1453, dividing his lands between his sons, Princes Vladislav and Vlatko. In April 1454, Herceg Stepan also signed a white peace with Republic of Ragusa.;x

EVENTNAME3775;The Succession in Brabant;x
EVENTHIST3775;The Duchy of Brabant had been under Burgundian influence for a while in the decades leading up to 1430 with side branches of the Burgundian dynasty occupying the title of Duke and on the 1st of August, 1430 it formally passed to the control of Philip the Good of Burgundy further strengthening the Burgundian hold on the Netherlands and continuing Philip's moves towards their unification.\n \n An alternative, however, would have been to offer the duchy to Philip's illegitimate son, Anthony, the Grand Bastard of Burgundy. This would ensure the duchy's independence through an illegitimate line of the Valois-Bourgogne dynasty, yet the Burgundian alliance would also safeguard the duchy against French aggression. Though only a boy at the time, Anthony would grow up to become a strong and respected warrior, as well as a powerful influence over and ally of his younger half-brother, Charles the Bold.;x

EVENTHIST28003;The monopoly on positions of authority by those born in Brabant, many of whom abused their positions for personal profit, has become a source of resentment in the remainder of the low countries. Demands for power to be devolved to the cities were presented by the burghers of Amsterdam, Haarlem and Delft. Most of the remaining cities outside Brabant and some of the rural nobility soon signed up to this League of Holland. We have two courses of action to choose between. Firstly, we could replace some of our officials with wavering individuals from within the League, thus dividing the League, removing one of their key grievances and cleansing our bureaucracy of graft.

EVENTHIST182000;Duke Jan IV of Brabant was a weak, incompetent ruler. His main interest was being left alone, and for the sake of maintaining peace and not alienating anybody, he made intolerable concessions to Jan of Bavaria and was a mere puppet of his Burgundian cousin. Being leery of Burgundian influence, lamenting the loss of Brabant's former power and upset about Jan's favouritism, the estates of Brabant approached Jan's younger, a lot more gifted brother Filips and, after Jan had refused to even listen to their complaints, made Filips ruwaert (regent). For two years, Jan entirely lost control of his possessions.;x

In an angry reaction, she declared her marriage invalid, fled to England and there fell in love with Humphrey of Gloucester, brother of the King, whom, after obtaining a dispens from the Antipope, she married and declared her coregent. With an English army, the couple on October 26th crossed the channel, landed in Calais and invaded Hainault. They managed to take control of most of the county and even threatened Brabant. Only with the support of his Burgundian cousin - and because her husband left her to be with his mistress - Jan IV of Brabant managed to beat her back, and the superior troops of Philipp captured Jacqueline in 1425.;x

While his brother Filips succeeded him in Brabant, Burgundy took full control of Hainault, Holland and Zeeland.

EVENTHIST3518;The Elector Friedrich Wilhelm (1640-1688), known as the Great Elector, had been one of the major winners of the Thirty Years War, increasing the size of Brandenburg's realm by nearly a third. His major achievement was to the administrative unity and the setting up of a small professional army of 24,000 men. He also managed to get his country free of Polish lordship over Prussia, and to welcome French 20,000 French Protestant refugees. On 28th June 1675, his army fought a tactical stalemate with the Swedes at the battle of Fehrbellin. The Swedes were unable to go on the offensive from poor preparations, and thus lost the war. That Sweden was unable to carry the sword of Gustavus Adolphus had a striking resonance all over Europe and Prussia occupied Swedish Pomerania until 1679.;x

First in Brandenburg, then in Lauenburg and finally 1423 in electoral Saxony the branches got extinct, and the remaining members of the family lacked unity and determination to secure the territories. Instead, the Hohenzollern and Wettins were given the old Askanian lands and took their former rank. The last step in this process was the extinction of the electoral branch in Saxony-Wittenberg with the heirless death of Albrecht III. This caused a tough contest between the Hohenzoller Elector Friedrich of Brandenburg and the Wettin Margrave Friedrich IV of Meissen for Albrecht's possessions. Emperor Sigismund has decided in our favour and granted the Electorate and Saxony-Wittenberg to us. This gives us a position of hegemony in Eastern Germany and in the electoral college.;x

Pope Pius II, determined to fight Hussitism, condemned Podiebrad's heretic attitude more and more vocally and encouraged an uprising of the catholic nobility in 1465. In order to back the rebels and depose Podiebrad, Pius' successor Paul II excommunicated the Bohemian King on December 23rd 1466, released all his subjects from their oaths of allegiance and searched for a reliably catholic prince who would drive him away and take the Bohemian throne.

EVENTHIST132016;During the weak rule of the Wittelsbachs and Luxemburgs, several cities, especially the twin cities of Berlin and Cölln, in Brandenburg began to grow and prosper, obtained a huge deal of autonomy and joined the Hanseatic League. After the arrival of the Hohenzollern, the towns were keen on having their privileges confirmed or even extended. They refused any interference in their internal politics, assumed judicative powers within their city walls and even refused the Elector entrance. Obviously, this autononomy was a great hindrance to the consolidation of electoral authority. Therefore Friedrich II gladly took the opportunity when the community of Berlin called for his aid in a conflict with the town council of Berlin-Cölln. Friedrich marched to the city with 6000 men, quickly entered the city and forced the council into submission. The Elector obtained the right to confirm nominations to the council, renounced the town's jurisdictive privileges, forced it to cancel all agreements with other cities, including the Hanseatic League, and began the construction of a strong fortress that would allow him to control the city. In the following years, similar measures were applied in most other cities.;x

Still the electoral residence and administrative center remained Tangermünde, situated west of the Elbe. Elector Friedrich II was the first ruler to realise the town's potential and had chosen it as his capital already upon ascending the throne. After suppressing its desire for autonomy and firmly establishing his authority, the Elector in 1451 ordered to move most administrative institutions and his residence to Berlin-Cölln. Berlin-Cölln, after the 1640 fully merged and called Berlin, thereafter was the capital of Brandenburg, the Kingdom of Prussia and the German Empire and today again is the capital and biggest city of Germany.;x

EVENTHIST3603;Anne of Brittany, the daughter of Duke François II of Brittany, was heiress to his duchy. Shortly before her father's death (1488), a French army under Louis de La Trémoille successfully invaded Brittany and secured the duke's promise that Anne would marry only with the consent of the French crown. Upon becoming duchess, the young Anne's hand and her duchy were eagerly sought. To prevent France from swallowing up the duchy, a coalition including Archduke Maximilian of Austria, King Henry VII of England, and King Ferdinand II of Aragón sent forces to Anne's aid. Nevertheless, Anne's situation was perilous and she appealed (1489) directly to Maximilian for protection. In 1490, Maximilian married Anne by proxy but failed to assist her with armed strength. Besieged at Rennes in 1491, Anne was forced by the French to annul her marriage and was quickly married to Charles VIII. It was agreed that if Charles died before Anne without issue, she was to marry his successor. Accordingly, in 1499, she married Louis XII, who had previously obtained a divorce from his first wife. The marriage (1514) of Claude, Anne's daughter by Louis XII, to François of Angoulême (later François Ier of France) led to the eventual incorporation (1532) by France of Brittany, which had previously remained theoretically separate.;x

In a subsequent solemn Act of unity, the Estates granted the Duke's request and thus ensured that the sovereign rights of Anne would be maintained.

Forgiven a first time by the Regent of France, Anne de Beaujeu, he continued to resist her regime. In January 1487, he was again forced to flee with several great lords of France, the count of Dunois, Albret, the Duke of Bourbon, and the Duke of Lorraine, taking refuge in Nantes in the court of his friend Duke François II.

Added to this, was the obvious strategic threat posed by a Breton coast under French rule. Nevertheless, King Henry VII of England was reluctant to go to war with France and instead preferred a diplomatic settlement.

De Rieux unhappily favoured the proposal of a marriage between her and Alain d'Albret, who, being a powerful lord of Gascony and father to the King of Navarre, would undoubtedly have been able to give her very efficient support. However, Anne made public her distaste for the union and in so doing had alienated de Rieux and Alain d'Albret. Thus, the Duchess favoured Count Dunois and her Chancellor, Philip de Montauban. De Rieux resonded with accusations that Dunois and de Montauban favoured the interests of the French, and refused Anne admittance into Nantes unless she would enter privately. To complicate matters, Anne had received overtures from several other realms in Europe. The King of England, Henry VII, had proposed the 11 year old Duke of Buckingham as a suitor for Anne. Meanwhile, King Ferdinand of Spain had proposed his son, Don Juan, the 11 year old 'infanta of Spain'. In the end, both Spain and England agreed to withdraw their suitors in favour of Maximilian of Austria, the favourite of Anne's deceased father.;x

Thus, on December 6, 1491 Charles VIII married Anne of Brittany at Langeais.

Aiding the English would certainly help secure a sovereign future for Brittany. However, France yearned for French unity and a French King, and an English King would certainly contradict these desires. At Amiens, Bedford had proposed a marriage alliance and so Philip offered his sister, Anne to Bedford, and sister Margaret to Arthur of Brittany, Earl of Richmond.

EVENTHIST3597;Mary of Valois was the only daughter of Charles le Téméraire (Charles the Bold) and so heiress of all the rich Burgundian domains from the Saone River up to the Low Countries. When her father died in 1477 at the age of 43, Mary was only nineteen and Louis XI of France seized the opportunity provided with his rival's death to take possession of the duchy of Burgundy and also of Franche-Comté, Picardie and Artois. He justified his military intervention with the fact that these lands had always been fiefs to the French crown and that with Charles' death, the last member of the French Valois dynasty they had 'de facto', according to the salic law, reverted to France. But the choice of which prince should marry the duchess would be of particular importance for the future political and economical stability of Western Europe, so he urged Mary to accept his son, the Dauphin Charles, as husband, in order to secure the inheritance of the Low Countries for his descendants too, even by force of arms if necessary. Mary, however, distrusted Louis and declined any French support and offer of marriage but, in order to be recognized as legitimate ruler over the Low Countries and to get financial and military help of Flemish cities against the French aggression, she made so great concessions as to reduce the Burgundian states effectively to a sort of federation of provinces. Satisfied that the country was sufficiently weakened and disorganized, Louis XI ordered his army into Artois and Hainault, but the imminence of danger seemed to revive in the Burgundian provinces a spirit of loyalty towards the Valois heiress and arrangements were made for the marriage of Mary with Maximilian of Habsburg, Archduke of Austria and son of the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick III. The alliance with the Empire was intended to save the inheritance of the young princess from the French hands. However it would result in thereafter making Low Countries direct dominions of the House of Habsburg. The marriage between Mary and Maximilian was hastily celebrated at Ghent on 18 August 1477.;x

The Duchy of Burgundy was one of the largest medieval states in Western Europe, covering most of the Low Countries (today's Belgium and Holland), Luxembourg and Franche-Comté.

EVENTHIST137001;Sigismund of Tyrol ruled the Vorlande, the Habsburg possessions north of the Alps, in Alsace and Breisgau, very ineffectively. Most of the local nobility operated as robber barons, there was virtually no tax collection and the Swiss neighbours in the south occasionally sent pillaging troops in and tried to expand into these territories. One such border war with Helvetia in 1468 was concluded by Sigismund promising to pay 10000 Guldens. Since he was always in financial trouble, he soon searched for someone to grant him a credit. After the Emperor's and the French King's refusal, the only likely creditor was Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy. When on March 21st 1469 the two princes met in Arras, they negotiated an even more far-reaching agreement: Sigismund saw Burgundy as a potentially useful ally against the Helvetian threat, and in order to tie him closely to Tyrol, he offered him to mortgage the Vorlande for an amount of 50000 Guldens. To rebuy the provinces, Tyrol would have had to pay back not only this sum, but also all expenses Burgundy would make for the establishment of an administration, which seemed practically impossible for the struggling Count. Hence by the treaty of St. Omer signed in May Sigismund sold the Vorlande to Burgundy in exchange for the money he badly needed and Burgundian support against his Helvetian enemies. Only due to Charles' premature death in battle the vorlande were returned to Tyrol.;x

Nor could the disciplined city militias of the low countries be relied upon as the city governments were often in oposition to the Dukes of Burgundy.

The Treaty arose primarily as a means with which to secure the Low Countries from Louis's claims, and thus preserve the stability and status of Duke Philippe's lowland inheritance. The Treaty formally rendered to Louis provinces in his realm that he had claimed at the outset of the war, and also recognized and reaffirmed Flandern as fief of France. In order to solidify a lasting peace, the Treaty pledged Mary's daughter, Margaret, to Louis's son and heir, Charles.

France was at odds with the Pope, Burgundy delayed their help, Milan was trying to seize Genoa, and Florence cynically advised the Pope to let the Turks and the Venetians wear each other out. But the Venetians and the Hungarians signed their support in 1463. Thousands of destitute men from all of Europe came to the Pope's call and he led them to Ancona in the summer of 1464, where he became very ill.

In order to be set free he made a treaty with the people of Flanders in which it was stated that he was recognized as regent of the Low Countries except for Flanders, which was to be governed by his son Philip under guardianship of a council. Moreover, a congress of all the provinces was to be summoned annually, to provide for the general welfare. The treaty was signed on 16 May 1488 under Maximilian's promise to dismiss all foreign troops within a few days.

Maximilian obtained uncontrolled guardianship of his son, absolute dominion over Flanders and the other provinces. The rebelling burghers were severely punished for remembering that they had been freemen.

But he swore to maintain only the privileges granted before 1477, thus proclaiming null and void all those which might have been acquired since the death of his grandfather Charles the Rush.

EVENTHIST137030;During the early years of his reign, King Louis XI had done much to antagonize the great magnates of France in his attempts to centralize the monarchy. A steady stream of dissenters flowed to a group of nobles who would form a League against Louis. Charles, Count of Charolais and son of Philippe, Duke of Burgundy, had captured several of the Somme territories along with several towns and estates ceded to Jean, Count of Etampes and Nevers, by the Duke of Burgundy. Royal troops led by Louis met the Burgundian army at Montlhery. The resulting battle left Burgundians masters of the field. Louis had escaped to Paris where he would soon be under seige. The Burgundian and Breton troops, united, forced Louis to agree to the rebels' demands. Thus, Burgundy regained the Somme towns and Charles Count of Charolais received the territories ceded to Jean Count of Etampes and Nevers. Louis XI would not be compensated for the Somme towns, and, by the terms of the Treaty, Louis was not entitled to repurchase the territory until after Charles' death.;x

No one was more alarmed than Ludovico Sforza, who had seized Milan from his nephew Gian Galeazzo and had subsequently seen his claim legitimized by Maximilian King of the Romans. Now, French imperliastic designs had directly challenged Philippe's father, Maximilan. Duke Philippe's interest in the matter sparked from claims to his ancestral domains in France, which had for some time now been ignored. Years before, Maximilian had refused to sign the Treaty of Arras.

In 1512 when the French troops were routed from Italy by the Swiss mercenaries in their retaking of Milan, Mercurino managed to stipulate an agreement with Louis XII, King of France, with which the county of Burgundy was to be considered as Burgundian imperial fief and 'neutralized territory' during war times.

She refused Louis XI' offer to marry the Dauphin and cancelled the promise of marriage previously made to Maximilian of Habsburg, as both solutions would mean the end of independence from France or the Empire. However arrangements for a marriage were to be hastened and for sure other suitors wouldn't miss the opportunity to get the Burgundian throne.

EVENTNAME137082;Feast of the Pheasant;x
EVENTHIST137082;On February 17, 1454, a most remarkable feast took place at Duke Phillip the Goods primary residence at Lille. Philip, the third and in some ways most successful of the four Valois dukes of Burgundy, was well known for arranging magnificent and spectacular events, but this one was destined to top them all. Rather conveniently, Philip had a vow written out which he passed to the herald to read out, after which he repeated his vow to take up the cross, as long as the King of France or his regent went as well, or to go alone as long as his own lands were secure and peaceful. He then went on to swear to seek out the Ottoman leader and defeat him in single combat. In what appears to have been a carefully organised rush of enthusiasm, his son Charles, Count of Charolais, immediately made similar oaths, as did the Duke of Cleves. Alas the crusade to free Constantinople never happened. Philip announced sweeping reforms to his finances, explicitly stated as being to raise money for the crusade, and seriously cut back on domestic expenses and pensions. He completely reformed his revenue raising mechanisms, and made them far more efficient.;x

EVENTHIST137301;Founded in 1425 by Pope Martin V, the K.U.Leuven bears the honour of being the oldest Catholic university in the world still in existence and the oldest university in the Low Countries. In its early days this University was modeled on the universities of Paris, Cologne and Vienna. In a short time it grew into one of the largest and most renowned universities in Europe. Its academic fame attracted scientists who have made valuable contributions to European culture. Let us enumerate a few renowned names: In the 16th century the humanist, Desiderius Erasmus, lectured here. He founded the Collegium Trilingue in 1517 for the study of Hebrew, Latin and Greek - the first of its kind. The tutor of the young emperor Charles V, Adriaan Cardinal Florensz of Utrecht, was a professor here before being elected in 1522 as the last non-Italian Pope before Pope John Paul II.

The Charter of Rights obtained from Mary restored to the Flemish burghs all the local and communal rights which had been abolished by the arbitrary decrees of Mary's predecessors in their efforts to create a centralized state in the Low Countries.

EVENTHIST23022;The political decline of the empire and the constant sieges laid against its cities drove not only simple folk but even many aristocrats into the arms of the usurers, forcing them to borrow money at high and rising interest rates to support themselves, and to use their property and mobile assets as a security and relinquish them if they were unable to meet the contractual repayments. A growing number of Byzantine aristocrats and men of wealth transferred their movable assets to Latin colonies such as Negroponte, Korone/Methone, and Crete. Eventually they even deposited them in Italian banks or invested in the public debt of Venice, Genoa, and Caffa. While state finances shrank drastically during the last century of the empire, while the last Byzantine emperors had increasing difficulties making basic payments and were deprived, not least, of the ability to distribute largesse goods with a generosity appropriate to their self-conception.;x

After the Mekong's waters crest--when its downstream channels can handle the volume of water--the flow reverses, and water flows out of the engorged lake. However, sometimes this is delayed or flooding is much worse. As the level of the Tonle Sap retreats, it deposits a new layer of sediment.

The condition for the peace was the concertation of a marriage between his son Enrique and the daughter of the King of Navarre, Blanca. However two years later, a large faction of nobles raised against the excesses of Alvaro de Luna, and the infante Enrique and the King of Navarre returned to lead them in rebellion. The King initially supported his Constable, but was overpowered and had to oust him again in 1439. The wedding of Enrique and Blanca calmed the situation, but now Juan II could add to the list of people hostile to him his own son, vicious, weaker and more indolent than himself.

His uncle Fernando had been elected King of Aragon at the Caspe arrangement, and his son Alfonso became King of Aragon at his death. However his brothers, the infantes Juan and Enrique wanted to maintain their power in Castile, where all their family castles, villages and lands were located. The weakness of young Juan II invited the rebellious nobles to strive for his control. Two parties were formed, one leaded by the infante Juan, designated heir of Aragon, and married to the heiress of Navarre, and the other one by the infante Enrique, who was more desperate for power. In 1420 Enrique, tired of the predominant influence of his brother, assaulted the royal residence and seized the King. Princess Catalina, sister of the King, accepted to marry him.

He imprisoned Enrique and deprived runaway Davalos of his title. By then Alvaro de Luna was his main advisor, and the King appointed him as Constable. Since Luna had no family states, and owed the King all his power, Juan could rely on his loyalty. Immediately the infantes Juan and Enrique and their supporters joined forces against the rising star of Constable Luna. By 1425 they were able to obtain the release of Enrique and the ousting of Alvaro de Luna, who managed however to come back, more powerful than ever, willing to reduce the power of the infantes and their supporters. That year, the infante Juan became King of Navarre, increasing his already vast resources, and Enrique asked for the help of his older brother Alfonso, King of Aragon.

Finally, after the Constable was involved in the killing of a minister that opposed him, the King gave his consent and de Luna was captured, tried, found guilty of treason, and beheaded. The King was only 48 years old, but not in very good condition, and the remorse for the killing of his only friend, that had accompanied him for his entire life, affected his health. He fell ill and was dead in a year. Alvaro de Luna was declared innocent in 1658.

They excused their opposition under their support for young Alfonso, Enrique's half-brother and previous heir, which had been displaced by the birth of Juana. Although a male heir was preferred, Juana was legally the heiress, unless her birth could be proven illegal. Given the antecedents of Enrique IV the impotent, and the known adulterous behavior of the Queen, it was not very difficult for the rebels to claim that Juana was not Enrique's daughter, but born from the adultery of the Queen with Beltrán de la Cueva. From then on, Juana would be despitefully known as la Beltraneja. Pacheco, Carrillo, and many others raised in open rebellion, asking for the recognition of Alfonso as heir. Instead of going to war against them, the weak, peace-seeking Enrique offered to accept their demands on the condition that Alfonso would marry his daughter Juana.

Isabel, very saddened, saw that she had no chance to push her claim as Queen of Castile, and offered Enrique a pact. She will renounce to her claim in exchange for being named heir to the Kingdom. In other words, she offered to wait until Enrique's death. Enrique, who was a weak King, accepted. In September 1468, in the pact of Guisando, Enrique discarded his daughter as heir and named Isabel the Princess of Asturias, ending the civil war. The acceptance of Isabel as heir to the Kingdom was, to the eyes of many, a recognition of the illegitimacy of Juana.

EVENTNAME7124;Second Phase of the War of Granada;x
EVENTHIST7124;The war of Granada started as a frontier war with a Muslim attack on Zahara in December 1481, that was responded by the Marquis of Cadiz in February 1482 with the conquest of Alhama, deep inside Muslim terrritory. The Kings gave orders of holding Alhama at all cost, as the first step in the conquest of the Nasrid emirate. Alhama held thanks to the help of the Duke of Medina-Sidonia, personal enemy of the Marquis of Cadiz, a clear demonstration that the war was going to unite the Kingdoms. At the beginning of the war, the Christians were not prepared for the offensive, and suffered several setbacks, but Granada was in a civil war, divided in two factions fighting each other and against the Christians, and after the battle of Lucena, the leader of one faction, Boabdil, was captured. Fernando decided to realease him on terms to keep the Muslims divided. Fernando reorganized the army, introducing artillery in great amounts, as a new weapon to conquer the Muslim strongholds in days instead of months. Through an extraordinary effort during the campaigns of 1484-86 the first phase of the war was concluded with the conquest of the Western part of the emirate of Granada, capturing Boabdil a second time. The pact made with him for his release included his renounciation to the parts of the emirate in the hands of his rival and uncle, Emir Muhammad XIII al-Zagal, and the surrender of Granada once it became under his control in exchange for a title and land states. The second phase of the war of Granada was then directed against the parts controlled by al-Zagal, the coast and the Eastern part of the emirate. After the fall of Baza and Almeria in 1489, Al-Zagal, defeated, abdicated, and Boabdil became in control of Granada. According to the treaty the war was over. But Boabdil refused to comply, forcing a third phase, the siege of Granada, that was stablished in 1491. The artillery was not used to preserve the city, and Granada will finally surrender in January 1492. 780 years of Muslim presence in the peninsula had come to an end.;x

EVENTHIST142004;In 1469 Alfonso V of Portugal was presented with the opportunity of becoming the King of Castile when he and his brother-in-law Enrique IV of Castile agreed on his marriage to Isabel, Princess of Asturias (heir title). But the deal failed when Isabel married Fernando of Aragon. When Enrique died and Isabel proclaimed herself Queen, in 1475, he saw his chance disappearing and decided to play hard. In a month he was married to his niece, Juana, and had claimed the crown of Castile for himself, invading the country. The plan was good because Juana had also the support of France and a great part of the Castilian nobility who rebelled in her support. Despite the simultaneous invasion from France and Portugal, and the rebellion of the nobles in the West of Castile, the war did not go well. The French were stopped by the Basques, while Fernando, with troops mostly from Castile and Asturias, inflicted a crushing defeat to the Portuguese in Toro in 1476. Alfonso traveled to France to try to get a stronger involvement from Louis XI, but the French had lost interest. By then Fernando had recovered control of all the Northwest. The war at sea, that extended as far as the coast of Guinea, claimed by Castile, was also favorable to Isabel. Alfonso's marriage to his niece was not recognized by the Pope, and a last invasion at the South ended also in defeat at la Albuera in February, 1479. With the nobility subdued and the Portuguese defeated, Castile had now the upper hand, but Isabel was half Portuguese herself, and Portuguese was her first language. She desired a perpetual peace with Portugal, with long lasting friendship and perhaps a dynastic union in the future, like the one with Aragon, and she was prepared to be generous with the defeated to obtain it. The treaty of Alcacovas, was concluded in September 4, 1479. It had four parts, all of them historically important. In the first part, Isabel and Fernando were recognized as rightful Kings of Castile and Leon, and Alfonso was recognized as rightful King of Portugal. In the second part, Juana renounced to her claim to the crown of Castile and was forced to expend the rest of her life in a convent in Portugal. In the third part, the future marriage between the infant Alfonso, son of Joao and the infant Isabel, daughter of the Catholic Kings was arranged. And in the fourth part, Castile accepted the claim of Portugal over Guinea, and the Atlantic coast of Africa, Madeira, Azores and Cape Verde, and any future discoveries South of the Canary Islands toward Guinea. Portugal accepted the claim of Castile over the Canary Islands. The treaty of Alcacovas is very important because it created a long lasting peace between Portugal and Spain, and set the basis for future diplomatic resolution of conflicts, like the discovery of the New World and the treaty of Tordesillas. Some believe it was crucial to the discovery of the New World by Spain, as Africa was reserved for Portugal, leaving only the unknown West for Spain.;x

She was to become Queen, but not in Castile, as her marriage to Alfonso V of Portugal had already been arranged by Enrique without her consent. Her rival Juana, doubtful daughter of Enrique, was going to marry Alfonso's son and heir, and they would become King and Queen of Portugal and Castile at the deaths of Alfonso and Enrique, bypassing her dynastic rights recognized at Guisando. After Guisando, Isabel became a prisoner of Villena, waiting to be sent to Lisbon. But young Isabel was not the puppet that Villena expected. In the absence of Villena and with the excuse of arranging for the first anniversary funerals for his brother Alfonso, she managed to escape vigilance, and helped by the warrior Bishop Carrillo and his soldiers, made it to Valladolid, where she was safe from Villena. But it was a temporary solution. There was only one way to escape Villena's trap, and it was getting married with some prince that would support with armies her right to the crown of Castile. That reduced her long list of candidates to two, Charles the Duke of Guyenne, brother of Louis XI of France, and Fernando the King of Sicily and Prince of Aragon. Fernando was her age, spoke her language, and had already fathered two illegitimate children at 17, which labelled him as an expert, not a small thing after the problems originated by the impotence of Enrique. Fernando was also the next candidate to the throne of Castile after herself, so his choice eliminated another possible source of problems. It is probable that she could already envision a reunification of the Kingdoms of Hispania, as all the rest of her actions in her life pursued that goal. This decision was not exempt of problems, as Enrique would denounce the pacts of Guisando, reinstating his daughter Juana as heir, and the country would not be happy to see a renewal of the nobility wars.;x

EVENTNAME142011;Let's Consummate the Union;x
EVENTHIST142011;When Isabel met Fernando at Valladolid it was love at first sight. Fernando had faced many dangers to come to her rescue, crossing in disguise parts of Castile that were hostile to them. The wedding had to proceed quickly to prevent Enrique from interfering, but there remained a problem. Isabel and Fernando were both Trastamara, and being second cousins required a papal dispensation to legally marry. But Juan II of Aragon had not succeeded in obtaining it. Pope Paul II was in good terms with Enrique, and had already granted a papal dispensation for Isabel and Alfonso V of Portugal, also related, and refused to give a second dispensation for the same person. But nothing could stand in the way of love, and a papal dispensation was quickly forged and dated five years before, during the papacy of Pius II. A real dispensation will not be obtained until 1471 with Sixtus IV, and by then the couple already had a daughter. After the wedding night, the sheets were shown to the people to demonstrate that the virgin was no more, in the accepted custom of the time. This demonstration of the consummation of the marriage partially contributed to calm the fears that the unauthorised wedding would precipitate Castile back into the nobility strife that characterized the reign of Enrique IV the impotent. When Enrique denounced the pacts of Guisando, naming his doubtful daughter Juana the heir, Isabel made public a manifest of allegiance to the pacts and to Enrique for as long as he was alive. Enrique, as indecisive as always, did not take any measure, delaying the civil war until his dead. Meanwhile most of the nobility took sides with Juana, even those that had previously challenged her legitimacy to weaken Enrique, as now they opposed the strong monarchy represented by Isabel and Fernando.;x

EVENTNAME142012;Isabel and Fernando Kings of Castile;x
EVENTHIST142012;When Enrique dies, Isabel proclaims herself Queen of Castile the next day, basing her right in the pacts of Guisando. Fernando, back in Aragon, is upset, as having himself a right to the throne, he does not want to be a mere consort. A month later they reach an agreement, they will be both Queen and King of Castile, with the same powers but with Isabel taking precedence and keeping the right to the crown in exclusivity. But Isabel proclamation triggers the delayed civil war, as the nobles rally in support of Juana. Isabel has not been idle those five years, and she has the support of the Basques and Asturians, many cities, the powerful Mendoza family and other supporters of a strong monarchy. The conflict becomes international because France and Portugal support Juana, now married to Alfonso V of Portugal, and Aragon supports Isabel and Fernando. While the Basques keep the French at bay, Fernando takes command of Isabel armies and decisively defeats the Portuguese at Toro in 1476 and then proceeds to suppress the rebel nobles. But Isabel, whose first language was Portuguese from her mother, is very generous with the defeated Alfonso of Portugal in the treaty of Alcacovas in 1479. She has in mind the union of all the Kingdoms in Spain and wants to keep good relations. She also forgives the nobles. Only one person will not find any forgiveness from her. Juana, daughter of an adulterous Queen married to an impotent King, is called -la Beltraneja- for being the alleged daughter of Don Beltran de la Cueva. Given that her marriage to her uncle Alfonso has been declared null by the Pope, Isabel will request and obtain from Alfonso her confinement in a convent. Since her remains are lost, we will never know for sure through DNA testing if she was the daughter of Enrique or not.;x

Europe was fascinated by the Iberian experiment, where more than the marriage of the Kings, it appeared that the countries were marrying in equal terms. The new Kings soon showed the power of a strong monarchy, administering justice everywhere, subjugating the rebellious nobles, reorganizing the military orders, and introducing church reforms. The problems of instability, anarchy and banditry that have plagued Castile and Aragon were solved. The city rights were restored and the high nobility put under control and balanced by the increase in numbers of the lower nobility.;x

EVENTNAME142014;Regnum Hispaniorum;x
EVENTHIST142014;For centuries the Christians in the Iberian Peninsula have dreamed of restoring the Visigothic Kingdom that was destroyed by the Muslim invasion. Many Kings have tried to achieve this union of Christians by force of arms, and have carried the title of Hispaniorum Imperator. Between them Sancho III of Navarre and Alfonso VII of Castile nearly achieved unity. But it was not by force that unity could be imposed, as a strong sense of freedom had been developed by the Iberians in their long struggle against Islam, manifested in an equally long struggle against their Christian neighbors. But the peaceful union under Isabel and Fernando will finally achieve what force could not. Under the fierce independence there was a common layer that Fernando and Isabel will identify and use to unite the new country. It was religion and the concept of blood purity. Now, with the country at peace it was a question of prioritizing the international policies of the new powerful entity. First Granada, Castile's biggest dream, as a crusade was useful to unite the peasants and nobles of the country under the same banner. It was a tremendous task, as the Moorish resistance had concentrated in Granada's roughest terrain and 400 years of defensive works had made it a bastion that will require ten years of continuous assaults. It was soon clear to Europeans that a new political entity had been born, and both Iberians and foreigners started referring to it not as Castile and Aragon, but as Spain.;x

In July a major battle was avoided by the King's sister Maria, married to Alfonso of Aragon, who planted her camp between both sides.

EVENTHIST142019;Alvaro de Luna was expending all his energies fending off rivals, but he wanted to gain glory in battle with the moors. Since the war against Aragon was cancelled, Juan II and de Luna turned to Granada. It was a good time to finish the Muslim presence in the peninsula, as there was a civil war in Granada. Muhammad IX had ordered the beheading of young Muhammad VIII in prison, and his party, the Banu Bannigas, chose Yusuf Ibn al Maw (Benalmao) as their new candidate and turned to Juan II for help. The Christian army, with their Muslim allies, reached Granada and started devastating the surroundings. The forces of Muhammad IX presented battle and suffered a crushing defeat. But the Christians did not follow up in the offensive against the Muslims and allowed Yusuf IV to become the new Emir as a vassal. Perhaps Alvaro de Luna feared the rumors that some nobles were raising against him, or the earthquake that took place scared the Christians. His enemies claimed that he was bought by Muslim gold. Whatever the cause, Juan II received some villages from Yusuf, and retreated. Three months later Yusuf was beheaded and Muhammad IX was back in power. Over the next two decades the Muslims will recover the loses, taking advantage of the civil war in Castile.;x6737

EVENTHIST142020;Although the war was initially favorable to Alvaro de Luna, the capture of Medina by the King of Navarre in 1441 left the King vulnerable, and Alvaro had to escape to save his life. Juan II became a prisoner of the King of Navarre until everybody became tired of him running the show. Even Prince Enrique with his favourite Juan Pacheco took the side of his father and helped him escape in 1444. The King, Prince Enrique and Alvaro de Luna joined forces against the most powerful nobles of Castile leaded by the King of Navarre and the infante Enrique. The battle took place at Olmedo on May 19, 1445 and it was a clear victory for Alvaro de Luna and the King. More importantly, the old infante Enrique died from his wounds a few days later finally bringing peace to Castile. As he was the Great Master of the powerful Order of St. James, the King invested Alvaro de Luna with this title, the most prestigious in Spain. But his rival and rising star Juan Pacheco, favourite of Prince Enrique, was made Marquis of Villena. Confident by his triumph the old Constable started making mistakes. He tried to make his post and honors hereditary to his son, and he arranged the wedding of Juan II, now a widower, with the young Princess Isabel of Portugal against his wishes. Isabel hated the old Constable because the power he had over the King, and Juan, always weak, could not resist his young wife wishes.;x6737

#;x
EVENTNAME142021;The County of Barcelona;x
EVENTHIST142021;The first years of Enrique IV under the rule of Juan Pacheco, Marquis of Villena, were happy ones. The economy was booming. The King of Navarre, that so much destabilized Castile in the past, was immersed in a civil war against his own son Carlos, and now it was the turn of Castile to destabilize Navarre and Aragon, by supporting him. But when Juan of Navarre asked for peace, Enrique agreed to sign it at the treaty of Alfaro-Corella in May 1457. A successful campaign was initiated against the moors of Granada, but it had to be suspended after two years because it was too expensive. The raising of taxes due to the war, and nobility unrest against Pacheco, undermined his position, and the King started to shift his support to Beltrán de la Cueva. The death of the heir of Navarre in 1461, together with the formation of a powerful league of nobles, was heralding troubles in the future, but in 1462 everything seemed in favor of Enrique. An heiress was born from his second marriage, and named Juana. Gibraltar was recovered from the moors. His former wife Blanca, new heiress to the throne of Navarre bequeathed her rights on him once she knew her father was sending her to her death at the hands of Gaston de Foix, and the Beaumonts of Navarre supported him. To add to his gaining of influence in the peninsula, the rebels in Barcelona offered him the County of Barcelona. Enrique decided to accept their offer to improve his chances of gaining Navarre, and quickly dispatched troops to both places.;x
ACTIONNAME142021A;Accept their offer;x
ACTIONNAME142021B;Reject their offer;x
#;x
EVENTNAME142022;Fooled by all;x
EVENTHIST142022;Enrique understood that his right to Navarre as a divorcee of Blanca was a weak one. But there were two candidates to the throne, and one of them was his vassal. Only two grandchildren of Carlos III of Navarre remained alive, Leonor and Jean V of Armagnac. Leonor, with a better right, was married to Gaston de Foix. Thus these two powerful houses of Gascony competed to gain the crown of Navarre, Foix supported by Aragon, as Juan had named Leonor and Gaston his heirs to Navarre, and Armagnac supported by Castile, as Jean of Armagnac was a vassal to Enrique IV. Both were also supported by a powerful party in Navarre, Foix/Aragon by the Gramonts and Armagnac/Castile by the Beaumonts. Militarily, Castile had the upper hand, as Aragon was immersed in a terrible civil war in Catalonia, and the rebels had sided with Castile. Enrique, ill-advised by his pro-Aragonian advisors, the Archbishop Carrillo, and his former favourite Juan Pacheco, decided to accept the proposition of an arbitrage by Louis XI of France. He trusted Louis because of the 100-year-long alliance between France and Castile, and hoped that he would rule that Catalonia had to be returned to Juan, but Navarre would be for his vassal. But Louis was not as impartial as Enrique believed, and had a secret agreement with Juan of Aragon to support him and Foix in exchange for the Roselló, and ruled in April, 1463 that both Navarre and Catalonia should be returned to Juan. Enrique understood that he had been fooled by all, but had to renounce to Barcelona and Navarre in agreement with the ruling. But his fall with Carrillo and Pacheco will have more immediate consequences.;x

A new Hermandad General (cities militia) was formed, and defeated the Alphonsine party at Olmedo on August 20, 1467. However the King started to make concessions to the rebels again, alienating the Mendoza, and pushing the Kingdom again into chaos. When the King authorised the creation of a Hermandad in Galicia, the peasants, artisans and the low nobility used it as an excuse to rise in rebellion against the oppressive high nobility, destroying their castles. The revolt of the Irmandiños escaped royal control and took two years to be subdued by the nobility.;x

EVENTHIST142024;During the ruling of Juan II and his son Enrique IV, the civil war in Granada provoked that many Muslim knights took refuge in Castile. The Castilian Kings, in need of a personal guard due to their troubles with the nobility, decided to create and maintain a morisco royal guard. The Muslims were completely loyal to the King during their service, due to their nature of outsiders. They also introduced an orientalizing fashion in the court, as the Kings sometimes dressed in Muslim style, and their weapons also became fashionable. 300 of them accompanied Enrique IV at his interview with Louis XI of France at Bayonne in 1463. They are just one of the many signs of the inter-relationship between Muslims and Christians during the Reconquista. The morisco guard was disbanded in 1466.;x

EVENTNAME142025;Treaty of Alcacovas Rejected;x
EVENTHIST142025;In 1469 Alfonso V of Portugal was presented with the opportunity of becoming the King of Castile when he and his brother-in-law Enrique IV of Castile agreed on his marriage to Isabel, Princess of Asturias (heir title). But the deal failed when Isabel married Fernando of Aragon. When Enrique died and Isabel proclaimed herself Queen, in 1475, he saw his chance disappearing and decided to play hard. In a month he was married to his niece, Juana, and had claimed the crown of Castile for himself, invading the country. The plan was good because Juana had also the support of France and a great part of the Castilian nobility who rebelled in her support. Despite the simultaneous invasion from France and Portugal, and the rebellion of the nobles in the West of Castile, the war did not go well. The French were stopped by the Basques, while Fernando, with troops mostly from Castile and Asturias, inflicted a crushing defeat to the Portuguese in Toro in 1476. Alfonso traveled to France to try to get a stronger involvement from Louis XI, but the French had lost interest. By then Fernando had recovered control of all the Northwest. The war at sea, that extended as far as the coast of Guinea, claimed by Castile, was also favorable to Isabel. Alfonso's marriage to his niece was not recognized by the Pope, and a last invasion at the South ended also in defeat at la Albuera in February, 1479. With the nobility subdued and the Portuguese defeated, Castile had now the upper hand, but Isabel was half Portuguese herself, and Portuguese was her first language. She desired a perpetual peace with Portugal, with long lasting friendship and perhaps a dynastic union in the future, like the one with Aragon, and she was prepared to be generous with the defeated to obtain it. The treaty of Alcacovas, was concluded in September 4, 1479. It had four parts, all of them historically important. In the first part, Isabel and Fernando were recognized as rightful Kings of Castile and Leon, and Alfonso was recognized as rightful King of Portugal. In the second part, Juana renounced to her claim to the crown of Castile and was forced to expend the rest of her life in a convent in Portugal. In the third part, the future marriage between the infant Alfonso, son of Joao and the infant Isabel, daughter of the Catholic Kings was arranged. And in the fourth part, Castile accepted the claim of Portugal over Guinea, and the Atlantic coast of Africa, Madeira, Azores and Cape Verde, and any future discoveries South of the Canary Islands toward Guinea. Portugal accepted the claim of Castile over the Canary Islands. Alfonso has chosen to reject our generous offer, and has decided to maintain his claim to the crown of Castile. He also reclaims the Canary Islands, despite the Pope's sentence in our favour.;x

EVENTNAME142026;Conquest of the Canary Islands;x
EVENTHIST142026;The conquest of the Canary Islands was initiated by a Norman noble, Jean de Bethencourt in 1403. He acknowledged the ownership of the islands by the King of Castile in exchange for their lordship. Lanzarote, Fuerteventura, and Hierro were quickly conquered, and the authority of Bethencourt acknowledged in Gomera, but the three bigger islands were too much for his means. The rights of lordship were sold by his nephew Manciot Bethencourt to the Count of Niebla in 1418, and ended in the hands of the Peraza family in 1445. The hostility of the Guanche natives prevented any attempt of conquest of the other islands wether by Castilians or Portuguese. In 1447 an attempt of conquest by Guillén de Peraza at La Palma, ended in disaster, with Guillén being killed by a stone stroke. During all this time, Castilian and Portuguese slavers, as well as the Pedraza, were capturing children and young Guanches that were sold for a great profit in the Peninsula. This situation continued until 1478.;x

EVENTHIST10000;The Ming Emperor Ming Cheng Zu siezed the throne from his nephew by starting a rebellion from his fiefdom in Bei Ping. His armies entered the imperial capital in Jian Wen year 4, month 6 (July, AD 1402). As the place of origin of his prosperity, Bei Ping was given the title Bei Jing (meaning northern capital) and Cheng Zu ordered the construction of Bei Jing in Yong Le year 4, leap month 7 (Aug-Sep, AD 1406). Cheng Zu was more comfortable in Bei Jing, where many of his loyal generals, soldiers and their families came from. Also moving the capital to the north strengthens the ability to defend and attack the Mongols from northern China, which had been a major concern.\n \n The construction of Bei Jing took 200 000 artisans, craftsmans, blacksmiths, carpenters, etc and 1 million civilian labourers. Materials such as bricks, gold, stones and timber were extracted, manufactured in and transported from all over the Empire. The Bei Jing city was rectangular in shape, 7 km east-west by 5.7 km north-south, surrounded by a moat and walls 12 m high and close to 20 m thick. In the centre of the City, occupying one-sixth its area, is the square shaped, similarly walled, Royal City - forbidden to civilians. The Royal City in Bei Jing was similar to the Royal City in the imperial capital. Inside the Royal City are lakes, small islands, hills, pavillions, terraces and a 720000 square metres rectangular walled compound called the Purple Forbidden City. The Purple Forbidden City consisted of around 1000 buildings including over 9000 rooms, antechamers and halls. The front part is where the Emperor handed down imperial decrees, receive audience of officials to administer the Empire, interview the best imperial examinees, receive foreign ambassadors, conduct cermonies, hold banquets, and study books. The rear of the Purple Forbidden City is where the Emperor, his family and servants reside.\n \n After 14 years of intermittent effort, the Royal City was basically completed. In Yong Le year 18, month 11, day 4 (8th December AD 1420), Cheng Zu decreed the capital be moved to Bei Jing, the original capital was to be called Nan Jing (southern capital).;x

Unfortunately, a thorough overhaul of the military is quite an undertaking. It will take quite a bit of money and effort, and even then the armed forces may not appreciate the changes, leading to instability and desertions. Shall we implement the reforms?;x

EVENTNAME10008;The arrival of the Jesuits;x
EVENTHIST10008;In 1581, the first Jesuit missionaries arrived in China, bringing gifts to the Emperor and exhibiting various mechanical inventions from Europe. They also exhibited great knowledge by creating a huge map of the world and in proposing sound ideas for calendar reform. But they also brought with them strange religious and philosophical ideas, which started to disrupt the traditional order of China. Should these missionaries be allowed to stay?;x

EVENTNAME10009;Famine;x
EVENTHIST10009;A famine of epic proportions has stricken our nation! A prolonged drought has caused harvests in the last few years to be exceedingly poor, leaving the people with very little, or nothing to eat. Deaths due to starvation or disease are rampant in the countryside, and reports of cannibalism and peasants grinding stones to make flour are commonplace. Many have resorted to banditry in order to feed themselves. The people cry out for the government to relieve their suffering, but to help so many will be costly indeed.

The armies of the barbarous Manchu move at will throughout the north and threaten Beijing. The people have completely lost faith in the current dynasty to rule. The ancients believed that when a dynasty was no longer fit to rule, the Mandate of Heaven was withdrawn from them and given to another.

EVENTNAME10044;Treasure Fleet policy debate;x
EVENTHIST3703;From 1405-1424, the Ming Emperor, Ming Cheng Zu, sent out a massive treasure fleet, under the command of the famed eunuch admiral Zheng He, for a total of 6 voyages to the Western Ocean (Indian Ocean). Construction started in AD 1403 with an order to produce over 500 ships. Timber and other materials, as well as carpenters, sailmakers, and shipwrights and labourers were transported from all over the Empire to Port Liu Jia. At its height 20,000 to 30,000 people worked and lived at the yards in Port Liu Jia.\n \n The ships were built for their grandeur. The largest of these enormous treasure ships were thought to be 400 feet long and 166 feet wide (compare Columbus's St. Maria of 85 ft and Cook's the Resolution of 111 ft). Once completed the fleet consisted of 317 ships with a crew of over 27,000 men, including soldiers, doctors, astronomers, and translators. The ships were beautifully painted and carved, fitted with bronze cannons, and contained grand cabins, and elaborate antechambers that were festooned with balconies and railings. Expensive treasures were loaded on the ships as gifts to impress foreign governments. The ships also utilised the latest technology, such as improved navigation equipment, watertight bulwark compartments, and the balanced rudder.\n \n The ships were built primarily to pursue Cheng Zu's missing nephew from whom Cheng Zu siezed the throne, and to strengthen China's influence over its neighbours. The fleet explored Indonesia, India, Arabia, Persia and East Africa, making diplomatic contact and sometimes intervening in the affairs of foreign countries. Large numbers of embassadors with gifts and tributes were brought to China.\n \n However, a dramatic turn around in policy occurred after Ren Zong succeeded the throne. Ren Zong was a conservative and influenced by Confucian beliefs. He thought that the enormous cost of supply and maintainence of the ships, crew, labourers and treasures created a heavy burden on the ordinary people. He ordered the suspension of treasure fleet voyages.;x

EVENTNAME10045;Recommissioning of Zheng He;x
EVENTHIST10045;Although Xuan Zong was an Emperor under strong Confucian influence and concentrated on domestic affairs, he tried to keep military generals content whilst pursuing his conservative policies. One such attempt was the recomissioning of Treasure Fleet voyages headed by Zheng He in AD 1430. He felt that the amount of incoming tribute was declining and ordered a new voyage to gain back the Empire's influence on foreign countries. Moreover, he felt that it would not cost a lot to the Empire as this voyage only made use of ships that were otherwise left idle to decay in the ports.;x
ACTIONNAME10045A;Once again for the glory of China;x
ACTIONNAME10045B;Zheng He's time has passed;x

EVENTNAME10046;Fate of the Treasure Fleet;x
EVENTHIST10046;After the death of Xuan Zong, the Three Yang became counsels to the Imperial administration. Zheng He has also died and these Confucian bureaucrats questioned the costly maintenance of the massive Treasure Fleet, especially when there were more pressing concerns on the land borders and internal affair.

EVENTNAME147001;Le Loi's Lam Son resistance in Vietnam;x
EVENTHIST147001;The region of An Nam covers northern Vietnam, had been part of China until 939 BC when warlords in An Nam defeated invading warlords from China and established separate rule. However, tributes were payed to China which also granted titles. An Nam expanded aggressively and invaded the Song dynasty to its north, Champa to its south, Laos and affiliated tribes to its west. After the Ming dynasty was founded in China An Nam continued to recognise Chinese overlordship. Through 400 years of independence, the people in An Nam developed a sense of national identity.\n \n In the late 1300s, the ruling Tran dynasty was overthrown and a powerful former minister tried to set up the Ho dynasty by making his son King in 1402 BC. However, a Tran prince had fled to China. Rather than recognising the usurpers China tried to restore the Tran dynasty, but this failed when the prince was murdered. China responded by invading the country in 1406 and made it into a new province, Jiao Zhi.\n \n This led to discontent amongst the local upper class who expected their privileges to be restored along with the Tran dynasty. The Ming administrative and military officials were domineering and insensitive to distinct local cultural practices. They applied the Chinese system of taxation, education, examination, and formal rites on the people abruptly. Rebellion soon spread rapidly. Zhang Fu, now Duke of Ying, was again sent to pacify An Nam twice. By Yong Le year 12 (AD 1414), almost all resistance forces within Jiao Zhi and hiding in neighbouring countries were eliminated. To pacify the people, Zhang Fu actively built up defences, forcefully organised many bandits into agricultural production, and employed surrendered Vietnamese leaders as officials.\n Zhang Fu was later replaced by Li Bin and a eunuch, Ma Qi. He began massively searching and extracting riches and treasures within the area, causing great discontent and immediate rebellion of many surrendered Vietnamese leaders, including the famous Le Loi who began the Lam Son resistance in 1418. Li Bin was forced to pursue Vietnamese leaders from all directions. In Yong Le year 18 (AD 1420), Chen Zhi was sent to assist Li Bin.;x

In Yong Le year 18 (AD 1420), Chen Zhi was sent to assist Li Bin. By autumn of the next year, the rebels were defeated, but Le Loi was not captured. In Yong Le year 20 (AD 1422), Li Bin died, Chen Zhi replaced him as commander. Chen Zhi and another general Fang Zheng did not get along. They met several defeats and neither succeeded in getting Le Loi under control. By Xuan De year 1, month 4 (May, AD 1426), Ming Emperor Xuan Zong ordered Wang Tong to replace both generals.;x

EVENTNAME147003;Truce with Le Loi;x
EVENTHIST147003;By Xuan De year 1, month 4 (May, AD 1426), Ming Emperor, Ming Xuan Zong ordered Wang Tong as commander in Jiao Zhi. Wong Tong, however, inherited his position from his father and was in fact a person with little courage. After a major defeat, he did not dare to fight Le Loi and retreated into the cities. In the winter of the same year, the Emperor sent yet another general, Liu Sheng, to lead 70 000 men to reinforce Li Tong. It took until the 9th month of the next year for Liu Sheng to enter Jiao Zhi, who was quickly ambushed and killed. By this time, Li Tong was shaken greatly, and decided, without imperial authority, to accept a truce offered by Le Loi. Under the truce, Le Loi claimed to have found a descendant of the Tran royal family and sought to reinstall him in return for Ming retreat from Jiao Zhi. Without imperial authority, Li Tong and Ma Qi then led about 80 000 officials, soldiers and their families back to China.\n \n Xuan Zong, had expressed the desire to retreat from Jiao Zhi since he first inherited the throne. He was supported by cabinet advisors Yang Shi Qi and Yang Ron, but was opposed by other bureaucrats. After the defeat of Liu Sheng, in Xuan De year 2, month 11 (November AD 1427) Xuan Zong ordered the retreat from Jiao Zhi and restoration of the Tran dynasty. However, before this order reached its destination, Wang Tong had already fully withdrew from Jiao Zhi. Xuan Zong therefore approved the truce.\n \n Very soon after this, in AD 1428, Le Loi poisoned the new nominal Tran King and declared himself King, founding the Le Dynasty and changing the name of the country to Dai Viet. Le Loi sent ambassadors to the Ming Emperor, seeking the title of King to be granted to himself, He claimed that there were no descendants of the Tran family and that the Vietnamese people wanted him to lead the country. This led to a diplomatic deadlock for some years. It was not until the summer of Xuan De year 6 (AD 1431) that Xuan Zong finally recognised Le Loi's authority over An Nam's national affairs.\n \n Anyway, if China wants to go to war, never make peace without vassalizing. Otherwise, attempt to incorporate Vietnamese as a normal part of the Empire will become impossible...;x

EVENTNAME147022;The Eastern Investigation Agency (Eastern Agency);x
EVENTHIST147022;The founding Emperor of the Ming dynasty, Tai Zu (Zhu Yuan Zhang), started out from the poorest and lowest backgrounds. He was orphaned at a young age, and his elder brothers and sisters either died or abandoned him soon after. Because of his background, he always felt insecure about his authority as Emperor. He was particularly suspicious of those officials or generals who made vital contributions in establishing the Ming dynasty and reunifying the whole country, and killed many of them soon afterwards. He also ordered that officials are to kneel down when petitioning to the Emperor and could be caned in court if they said anything he felt improper. To protect the Emperor's authority, Tai Zu assigned all of his 26 sons, except the eldest and another who died early, to major cities across the Empire as Lords of various fiefdoms.\n \n However, after Tai Zu's death, his fourth son, Zhu Di, Lord of Yan, started a rebellion and defeated the new Emperor, who was Zhu Di's nephew (Tai Zu's grandson). Zhu Di then became Emperor, title Cheng Zu (year title Yong Le). Cheng Zu recognised that assigning princes to fiefdoms could be a threat to imperial authority. He preferred the use of eunuchs to extend imperial authority even though under a family teaching laid down by Tai Zu, eunuchs are only supposed to run affairs inside the palace and forbidden to interfere in the running of the country's affairs. Eunuchs helped Cheng Zu during his rebellion by sending him secret intelligence from within the imperial palace.\n \n In Yong Le year 18, month 8 (September, AD 1420), Cheng Zu established the Eastern Investigation Agency (Eastern Agency), headed by eunuchs directly responsible to the Emperor, to eliminate remnants of loyalists to his nephew and monitor the situation of the civilians. It had the power to supervise, investigate and arrest officials and civilians without judicial permission.;x

EVENTHIST147023;Cheng Zu did not favour his eldest son, Zhu Gao Chi, who was quiet, obese and had trouble moving around. However, Zhu Gao Chi had a benevolent personality, and attracted the support of many Confucian officials. In contrast, Cheng Zu's second son, Zhu Gao Xu, took part in many battles when his father started the rebellion to sieze the throne. He was known to be ambitious, brave and fierce and had the loyalty of those generals and officials who contributed to secure Cheng Zu's throne. However, as time passed, Cheng Zu found that Zhu Gao Chi's eldest son, Zhu Zhan Ji, was brave and intelligent. This caused Cheng Zu to confirm the tradition of making eldest son, Zhu Gao Chi, the heir.\n \n Despite this many still petitioned Cheng Zu to make Zhu Gao Xu move to an assigned fiefdom so as to end any remaining factioning amongst officials in the imperial capital. Cheng Zu declined and punished those officials who interfered with the issue of succession. Finally, in Yong Le year 13 (AD 1415), Cheng Zu ordered Zhu Gao Xu to go to his newly assigned fiefdom in Shan Dong province. However, some of Zhu Gao Xu's loyalists remained in the capital.\n \n After Cheng Zu died, Zhu Gao Chi succeeded as Ren Zong, but died less than 1 year later. His son, Zhu Zhan Ji succeeded as Xuan Zong, as Cheng Zu had earlier wished. By this time, Zhu Gao Xu, Lord of Han, decided to rebel against his nephew to seize the throne, just like Cheng Zu had done before.;x

EVENTHIST147031;In Zheng Tong year 1 (AD 1436), the Emperor granted permission to write off Lu Chuan's large amounts of overdue tribute to the Ming Emperor. The Emperor had been persuaded by Lu Chuan's chief administrator, Si Ren Fa, that he was unable to pay because his land had been invaded by Mu Bang and few people were left on his land to be taxed. However, soon after making this excuse, Si Ren Fa launched attacks across large areas in Sout West Yun Nan, and siezed the land of other tribes which were loyal to Ming. By Zheng Tong year 3, month 7 (August, AD 1438), Si Ren Fa declared himself King. Mu Cheng (Duke of Qian) and general Fang Zheng were ordered to crush the rebellion. However, the two generals were at odds about the strategy which led to disaster by the next year. Fang Zheng led an army by himself and pursued deep into enemy territory but was killed in an ambush. Shocked by this news, Mu Cheng died suddenly in the army. His brother Mu Ang replaced him as commander but by Zheng Tong year 6, month 1, day 17 (8th february, AD 1441), Wang Zhen, the powerful eunuch in Ming government, decided to send 150,000 men, led by general Jiang Gui and commanded by military secretary Wang Ji, to eliminate the rebellion.;x

EVENTNAME147032;Another Rebellion in Lu Chuan;x
EVENTHIST147032;Wang Zhen, the powerful eunuch in Ming government, decided to send 150,000 men, led by general Jiang Gui and commanded by military secretary Wang Ji, to eliminate the Lu Chuan rebellion started by Si Ren Fa. Rebel forces were defeated and Ming army entered Lu Chuan. However, Si Ren Fa escaped to Myanmar. Ming government decreed that whichever tribe hands over Si Ren Fa to China would be rewarded with the land of Lu Chuan. Myanmar was hesitant about handing over Si Ren Fa, as they did not trust China about rewarding the land to them and feared revenge by Si Ren Fa's son, who fled to Meng Yang. After Ming troops returned home, Si Ren Fa's son, Si Ji Fa, returned to Lu Chuan and continued the rebellion.;x

EVENTHIST147035;Myanmar finally handed over the rebel leader Si Ren Fa (Si Ji Fa's father) to Ming authorities, but the Ming government did not give any reward to Myanmar because of the delay.

EVENTHIST147036;For the third time, the Emperor ordered Wang Ji to Yun Nan to capture Si Ji Fa. Wang Ji defeated Si Ji Fa, but was still unable to capture him. The army went past Meng Yang and reached Meng Na (near modern day Katha on the border of Kachin and Sagaing in northern Burma), to the astonishment and shock of many local tribes, who did not know of any Han Chinese who had ever crossed the Irrawaddy river since the time of antiquity. Wang Ji ordered the army to return home. The rebels supported Si Ren Fa's young son Si Lu as leader and continued to occupy the Meng Yang area. Wang Ji knew that the rebels could not be eliminated, and thus made an agreement with Si Lu, allowing them to reside in Meng Yang, but erected a stone tablet at Irrawaddy River, with the words 'thou shall not cross until the seas dry up and the rocks crumble'. The Ming Emperor then granted Myanmar authority to govern the Meng Yang area and to capture Si Ji Fa.;x

EVENTNAME147038;Classes in the Internal Palace;x
EVENTHIST147038;The founding Emperor of the Ming Dynasty, Ming Tai Zu, laid down a family teaching that eunuchs are only supposed to be servants running affairs inside the palace and forbidden to interfere in the running of the country's affairs. He also laid down the teaching that eunuchs are forbidden to be literate so as to curtail them from gaining power over the Emperor. But the later Emperor, Cheng Zu, breached this and began to use eunuchs as ambassadors to foreign countries, supervise armies outside the capital, and investigate civilian matters. Ming Xuan Zong continued this policy to delegate power to the eunuchs and in AD 1429 he established classes in the internal palace to teach eunuchs to be literate. Having eunuchs being literate is supposed to help the Emperor deal with national affairs in his palace more smoothly.;x

EVENTNAME147039;Three Yang Counselling Imperial Administration;x
EVENTHIST147039;The Three Yang refers to Yang Pu, Yang Shi Qi, and Yang Rong. The three of them served in the cabinet during the administration of 4 Emperors, Cheng Zu, Ren Zong, Xuan Zong and Ying Zong, participating in the administration of the most important classified imperial matters. Yang Shi Qi made proposals which contributed to reduced taxes, reduced labour service, pacification of outlaws, strengthening supervision of officials, and nomination of capable officials. Yang Rong was flexible, vigilant, astute, decisive and observant. He was also learned in geography, and contributed to various successful military policies.\n \n When Ying Zong ascended the throne in 1435, he was only aged 9. Grand Dowager Empress Zhang, grandmother of Ying Zong and widow of Ren Zong, supervised the administration, and placed faith on the advice of the Three Yang to make decisions. During the times of their Counsel, the imperial administration constantly trained its armies, strictly defended the borders, effectively supervised the officials and restrained the use of criminal punishments. The assistance of Three Yang for a long period contributed to peace and stability of early Ming.;x

EVENTNAME147040;End of Three Yang Counselling;x
EVENTHIST147040;Ming Emperor, Ying Zong, favoured the eunuch Wang Zhen, who had been by his side ever since boyhood when he was still the Grand Prince. Wang Zhen used this favouritism to interfere in imperial politics and punished officials at will, contrary to a familly teaching laid down by Tai Zu, the founding Emperor of the Ming dynasty, that eunuchs were not to interfere with imperial politics. Grand Dowager Empress Zhang thus threatened Wang Zhen with a knife at his neck and ordered him to be executed. But Ying Zong saved Wang Zhen.\n \n In late 1442, the Grand Dowage Empress Zhang died. Of the Three Yang Counsels, Yang Rong died in 1440. In 1442, an ordinary village elder alleged that Yang Shi Qi's eldest son had evaded imperial taxes and unlawfully occupied estate lands. Yang Shi Qi did not attempt to suppress or attack the allegation maker but instead admitted his son's offences and sought leniency from Ying Zong. Ying Zong, now aged 16, favoured Wang Zhen and was uneasy with the prestige of the Three Yang Counsels. He refused leniency for Yang Shi Qi's son. In the same year Yang Shi Qi himself, now aged 79 died in shame. Of the 3 counsels to the Emperor, only Yang Pu remained, without support, until 1446 when he died at age 74.;x

EVENTNAME147041;Ye Zong Liu's Rebellion;x
EVENTHIST147041;The Ming Empire's expensive foreign campaigns required the supply of large amounts of gold, silver and other metals. At the same time, as the Three Yang counsels declined in power and Wang Zhen rose to power in the central government, an atmosphere of corruption began to spread amongst the ruling class. In order to afford bribes, which is now endorsed by Wang Zhen, officials and rich people greatly increased their demand for personal wealth. This led to increased upper class domination and exploitation of the population, such as demanding higher rent from peasant farmers. Another unfortunate group were the mining workers, who because of their chance of being in contact with valuable metals were strictly and harshly treated and worked in poor conditions. A mining worker Ye Zong Liu was alleged to have stolen some silver. He killed a local official and began leading other miners in a rebellion. The rebels fought along the area of northern Fu Jian, southern Jie Jiang and eastern Jiang Xi. This developed into a substantial rebellion numbered into the tens of thousands. The government failed to successfully eliminate or pacify them. Although Ye Zong Liu was later killed by a fellow rebel leader, the rebellion did not die down until the earlier years of Jing Tai period (AD 1450s).;x

EVENTNAME147042;Deng Mao Qi's Rebellion;x
EVENTHIST147042;In a similar situation to Ye Zong Liu is another rebel leader Deng Mao Qi. He started a rebellion in central Fujian province on Zheng Tong year 13, month 8, day 2 (30th August, AD 1448). Rebel forces attacked and captured several cities in central Fu Jian province, and the forces grew rapidly. However, Deng Mao Qi was killed by government forces on Zheng Tong year 14, month 2, day 6 (28th February, AD 1449).;x

EVENTNAME147046;Second Copy of the Great Yong Le Encyclopedia;x
EVENTHIST147046;The Great Yong Le Encyclopedia was commissioned by Ming Emperor Cheng Zu (year title Yong Le). More than 3000 people compiled the Encyclopedia from 7000 to 8000 historical and contemporary books. It took 4 years and was completed in Yong Le year 5 (AD 1407). The Encyclopedia consisted of 370 million words, 22937 volumes, including 60 volumes of table of contents, classified into 11095 books. It was compiled from 7000 to 8000 historical and contemporary books. The Encyclopedia was hailed as the best, most developed, detailed and thorough Encyclopedia in traditional China. Its subjects include astromony, geography, political sytem, personal relationships, philosophy, notable objects, legends, climate, medicine, science, history and arts. A suggestion at the time to print copies and widely distribute the Encyclopedia was dismissed as the cost was too great. The Encycledia was kept in one of the towers in the Imperial Palace.\n \n Amongst all Ming Emperors, Emperor Shi Zong (year title Jia Jing) loved reading most, and often had the Encyclopedia placed at the desk. In Jia Jing year 36 (AD 1557), part of the Imperial Palace caught fire. Shi Zong made several imperial decrees within one single night, directing the saving of the Encyclopedia. Luckily the Encyclopedia was transported away and saved in time. Shaken by this experience, in Jia Jing year 41 (AD 1562), Shi Zong ordered an exact copy to be made through very strict copying procedures. The copy was kept at a different place in the Imperial Palace.\n \n The Encyclopedia met its fate at the end of the 1800s during late Qing dynasty when much of it was either burnt or stolen during Western invasions into Bei Jing. Only a few hundred volumes of the original Encyclopedia is left today.;x

EVENTHIST147049;The Four Treasury's Complete Collection assembled together the great accomplishments of traditional Chinese works. In Qian Long year 38 (1773 AD), Emperor Qian Long commissioned the Office of the Four Treasury's Complete Collection responsible for its compilation, which involved 360 officials and 3800 other personnel. The Collection collected 36000 books of 3461 types, 79309 volumes and approximately 840 million words. Its coverage is 3.5 times that of the Great Yong Le Encyclopedia. The Collection was divided into 4 parts: Classicals, Historicals, Personalities, and Works. Classicals contained Confucian classics on poetry, books, rituals and philosophy. Historicals included subjects like history, biography, geography, politics and bureaucratic system. Personalities included the different schools of philosophical, military, medical, agricultural and religious thought, as well as astromony, the calendar, arts, objects and legendary tales. Works collected literary works throughout the past 2000 years including poetry, verses and music. The main criticism of the Collection is that wordings of original books were changed if they have any connotion of conflict, offensiveness, disobedience, or obstructiveness against the Manchu Qing imperial administration.\n \n From Qian Long year 46-49 (AD 1781-1784), 4 copies of the Collection were completed and stored inside towers of imperial palaces in different parts of northern China. From Qian Long year 47-52 (AD 1782-1787), 3 other copies were made and stored in different parts of southern China.\n \n Three copies of the Collection were destroyed during Western invasions into Bei Jing and the Tai Ping rebellion during late 1800s.

EVENTNAME147063;We have conquered Taiwan;x
EVENTHIST147063;The Emperor Kiangxi commented when his admiral Shi Lang received the surrender of Taiwan in 1683 that ''Taiwan is no bigger than a ball of mud. We gain nothing by possessing it, and it would be no loss if we did not acquire it.'' He wished to remove the Chinese settlers and abandon Taiwan because of the deep-seated traditional idea that China was bounded by the seas. But Shi Lang argued forcefully for Taiwan's inclusion in the Qing empire: The island could not be left to its own devices because it would be used by pirates or foreign powers, who were ''drooling'' over it. It was, moreover, a bounteous place: ''Fish and salt spout forth from the sea, the mountains are filled with dense forests of tall trees and thick bamboo, there are sulfur, rattan, sugarcane, deerskins, and all that is needed for daily living. Nothing is lacking... This is truly a bountifully fertile piece of land and a strategic territory.'' Thanks to Shi Lang's arguments, the Emperor decided to make Taiwan a prefecture attached to Fujian Province. For all that Taiwan was neglected by the Qing the settlers and natives were discontented. There were more than a hundred rebellions during the Qing Dynasty. The frequency of rebellions, riots, and civil strife in Qing Dynasty Taiwan is evoked by the common saying ''every three years an uprising, every five years a rebellion''.;x

EVENTHIST200001;In the Feud of Soest that lasted from 1444 to 1449 the westphalian town of Soest, which was then among the biggest and richest cities of Germany, backed by Cologne's old enemy, the Duke of Kleve, managed to maintain its liberty against the claims of Archbishop Dietrich of Cologne. Like many other territorial princes of his time, the archbishop tried to consolidate his rule and to extend it according to the principles of roman law against the resistance of the Westphalian cities. A great part of former episcopal authority had been granted to the westphalian towns by incompetent archbishops, or outright assumed by the town councils. Thereby, so argumented the council of Soest, it became part of the town's liberty charter. The archbishop's desire to recover his old rights therefore seemed to be an attack on Soest's very existance. The town opposed these policies by accepting the Duke of Kleve and Mark as its new overlord on June 5th 1444. Kleve had been struggling for hegemony in the region with the colonian archbishops for a long time, and they took this chance to win a useful ally. The Duke confirmed Soest's privileges and granted new ones to them. This sparked a feud between the Archbishop and the Duke, which soon turned into major war with Burgundy, Münster, Osnabrück, Paderborn, Lippstadt, Hohenstein, Hoya and Lippe supporting Kleve and Bavaria, Saxony, Nassau and Brandenburg on Cologne's side. At the peak of the conflict, both factions fielded over 100000 soldiers. The possessions of Kleve and Cologne were severely devastated and depopulated. The turning point was when a bohemian mercenary army recruited by the Archbishop failed to take Soest and Lippstadt in 1447. Johann of Kleve, the son of the Duke who led the klevian army, then managed to convince the Bohemians to stop fighting. The feud ended with the decision of Pope Nicolas in favour of Kleve in 1449 that both sides had agreed to accept at a congress in Maastricht.;x

When the conflict started, his father appointed him commander of the clevian troops and sent him to Soest with 2400 foot and 800 mounted soldiers. On the way, Johann occupied the city of Xanten and still arrived in Soest much faster than the archbishop of Cologne had expected. There he took Soest's oath of allegiance and started to prepare the defense of the Westphalian towns. In the feud, he used fire arms very efficiently, as the first military leader. Vauban and Clausewitz consider the Feud of Soest as the birth of artillery as an effective weapon. After the victories against Cologne's bohemian mercenaries at Soest and Lippstadt that were achieved with a great amount of artillery he was called the Lion of Lippstadt and Soest.;x

In cooperation with the humanists Johann Weyer and Konrad Heresbach (and probably as well Erasmus) he worked out a church constitution in which he ordered tolerance for all Christian confessions and even prohibited arguments between catholics and protestants. Neither catholics nor protestants outside the United Duchies approved this, and Kleve was not able to maintain this policy for a long time since it was isolated.;x

In the United Duchies, he oversaw several projects, but the most notable one was the reconstruction of the city of Jülich from scratch after it had burned down in 1547, making it exemplary for renaissance architecture.

He was thus unable to rule his Duchies and he just pined away for the last two decades of his life. When his exceptionally talented son Karl Friedrich who was educated at the court in Vienna died prematurely of smallpox on February 9th 1575 and the younger son Johann Wilhelm showed corporal weakness and mental retardedness, the country was in a desolate situation. The United Duchies were effectively ruled by the estates from 1566 to 1592.;x

EVENTHIST200015;While Duke Wilhelm V was still alive in 1589, nobody really cared for him. The estates ruled the United Duchies arbitrarily and without much interest in the country's fate. The only person who seemed capable of saving Kleve was Wilhelm's son Johann Wilhelm, born in 1562. However, the young man never seemed to be able to live up to the expectation, and things got even worse when he started to show signs of insanity in 1589: he was paranoid, very irascible and completely unpredictable in his behaviour.;x

However, she had unscrupulous enemies in the nobility controlling the Duchies and especially in the Duke's sister, Sybille, who envied her for her beauty and suspected her of protestantism. Sybille sent a letter to the emperor in which she accused Jakoba of heresy, fornication and depravity, and got her arrested on May 8th 1595.

Mercator studied in Leuven, Belgium, under Gemma Frisius, and in 1552 he became a mapmaker and lecturer at the University of Duisburg, in the dominion of the Duke of Kleve, where he gladly moved since as a calvinist he had to fear religious persecution in the Netherlands. His map of Europe (published in 1554) was the best of its kind for many decades. He produced a map of the British Isles in 1564 and in the same year was made court cosmographer of Duke Wilhelm of Kleve.;x

EVENTHIST200020;Mary of Valois was the only daughter of Charles le Téméraire (Charles the Bold) and so heiress of all the rich Burgundian domains from the Saone River up to the Low Countries. After her father prematurely died, Mary was only nineteen and Louis XI of France seized the opportunity to take possession of the duchy of Burgundy and also of Franche-Comté, Picardie and Artois. He justified his military intervention with the fact that these lands had always been fiefs to the French crown and that with Charles' death, the last member of the French Valois dynasty they had 'de facto', according to the salic law, reverted to France. But the choice of which prince should marry the duchess would be of particular importance for the future political and economical stability of Western Europe, so he urged Mary to accept his son, the Dauphin Charles, as husband, in order to secure the inheritance of the Low Countries for his descendants too, even by force of arms if necessary. Mary, however, distrusted Louis and declined any French support and offer of marriage but, in order to be recognized as legitimate ruler over the Low Countries and to get financial and military help of Flemish cities against the French aggression, she made so great concessions as to reduce the Burgundian states effectively to a sort of federation of provinces. Satisfied that the country was sufficiently weakened and disorganized, Louis XI ordered his army into Artois and Hainault, but the imminence of danger seemed to revive in the Burgundian provinces a spirit of loyalty towards the Valois heiress and arrangements were made for the marriage of Mary with Johann von Kleve-Mark, son of Duke Johann I der Kriegerische who would provide substantial diplomatic and military resources to withstand any French aggression.;x

EVENTNAME200021;Münster Anabaptist Revolt;x
EVENTHIST200021;Anabaptism is considered to be an extreme form of radical Protestantism. The Zwickau Prophets and Thomas Müntzer were the very first Anabaptists of all time, though some scholars believe that similar doctrines can be found on John Wycliffe and Jan Hus. Anabaptists were distinguishable because of their belief that child baptism was a sin. Consequently they only baptized adults, believing that being a Christian had to be a mature thorough decision. Rejecting salvation only by faith such as Luther claimed (Romans 1.17), Anabaptists also believed a model life in Christ imitation was necessary to enter the Kingdom of Heaven. The first Anabaptist movements, such as that of Müntzer, were characterized by millenarist violence. Millenarism theologists claimed to have come to Earth to reform all customs and to prepare it for the imminent arrival of the Mesiah. Münster was by 1530's was a multi-confessional city, and as such, many Anabaptists from all over Rhineland flocked to it. Among their leaders were Jan van Leyden, Bernard Knipperdolling, Bernard Rothmann and Jan Matthys. After installing communism and polygamy, Jan van Leyden was crowned King of Münster and invited Dutch and German Anabaptists to join the city. Unfortunately the Bishop had already started the siege which lasted more than a year. Many foreigners were arrested in the proximity ad savagely tortured by catholic and protestant troops. After a large starve and desperation, two soldiers finally opened the city doors and let the Bishop's troops start the horrible massacre.;x

With the exception of the electors and the Habsburg Archdukes, the terriorial princes will be subject to these institutions and will therefore relish much less autonomy. Accepting these reforms would basically end our possibilities to act independently from the Empire.;x

EVENTNAME150000;Major tax raising;x
EVENTHIST150000;Since the middle of the fourteenth century, Corsica had been divided into three political entities. In the South, Dilà dei Monti (Beyond the Mountains) was the Terra di'Signori, the Land of the Lords held by feudal dynasties. The five most important were all issued from the same ancestor: Arrigu di Cinarca. The di Leca, the della Rocca, the d'Istria, the d'Ornanu and the di Bozzi kept fighting each other all the time, and alliances and truces between them were broken as easily as they were made. Having their support was essential for a foreign power trying to control this part of the island so they often found themselves supported in their petty strives by Pisa, Genoa or Aragon. Two of the Cinarchesi only managed to unite the whole Dilà under their rule. The first one had been Sinucellu Ghjudice di Cinarca (1219-1307) before dying in a Genoese cell. The second one was Vincentellu d'Istria appointed as a Viceroy by Alfons V of Aragon in 1416. In the North, Diquà dei Monti (Beneath the Mountains) was the Terra di U Cumunu, the Land of the Communes held by villagers' communities led by magistrates and making their own laws though they most often paid taxes to some higher authority. The original organization was kind of democratic but the powerful local families soon took the habit to manipulate the electoral system to keep the important positions between themselves. Some of them had been, or later would be, ennoblished by Genoa and frequent marriages occured between the d'Omessa, the della Casabianca, the di Matra, the di Casta and many others, and the Cinarchese or the Capicorsi lords. They were also merchant families who asked for peace and order before anything else and were ready to submit to whomever was insuring those, be they Pisan or Genoese Republics, or Aragonese Viceroy. In the Capicorsu, the Corsican Cape being the northernmost tip of the island, Genoese noble families had settled during the tweltfh and thirteenth centuries. Although they might be considered as Corsican more than a century later, the da Mare and the de Gentile still had strong ties with their branches which had remained in Genoa. They always provided the best support for the Genoese in their wars on the island. Only on a few occasions, when they deemed themselves tricked or robbed by the Republic, would they attempt to rebel or join ongoing revolts.\nBetween 1419 and 1421, Vincentellu d'Istria and his allies came to control the whole of Corsica except for the Genoese cities of Calvi and Bonifacio. The Republic of Genoa was weakened at the time and would soon come under Milanese domination, but still they wouldn't forget their claims. There are troops to pay for, fortresses to build and reinforce, and neutral lords to bribe to our cause...;x

At the same time, Russia was pushing for her own candidate, the Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, son-in-law of the Czarina Catherine I. After much bribing, negotiation and behind the scene diplomacy, Maurice was summoned to either leave or suffer war. It started in 1727, with Russia firmly committed and sending 8,000 troops to conquer the Duchy within 8 days.

Queen Helena did not take well that Jean had a son, Jacques, from her mistress Marietta Patras, to the point of biting her nose off. When Charlotte was fourteen, Helena married her daughter to Joao of Coimbra, grandson of Joao I of Portugal. But Joao proved to be too strong minded and opposed the Queen pro-orthodox policies, so a year later she had him poisoned by her foster-brother the Chamberlain Thomas. Charlotte called from help from her half-brother Jacques, who had the Queen's foster-brother Thomas murdered. King Jean, who loved his 15 year old son very much, and had previously made him archbishop of Nicosia, responded to the Queen's wrath by sending him to Rhodes, were he was well received for opposing the orthodox Queen.;x

He was forbidden from entering the palace, and was impeded from attending the coronation, that as archbishop of Nicosia he should have officiated. Jacques, as the favourite of his father, had expected to inherit the Kingdom, indeed a possibility had Jean lived longer. But now he had few supporters if any. He had a bad press in the west and the Pope, the Hospitallers and Savoy were strong supporters of his half-sister. The Genoese were, as always, his enemies.

The negotiations took time because the Venetians insisted that the bride had to be no mere royal consort, but full Queen and heir to the Kingdom. The married by proxy took place at the Hall of the Signoria of the ducal palace on July 1468. But due to the outstanding situation of Cyprus to control the trade route with levant, a new candidate appeared. Ferrante I of Naples is offering his daughter Leonora as a bride to us. This is upsetting the Venetians very much. Their envoy Domenico Gradenigo has threatened with supporting Charlotte if we join their enemy of Naples.

A few months later, Andrea Cornaro and Marco Bembo, uncle and cousin of Caterina, took him on a hunting party during which he fell violently ill dying a week later. Caterina was now the Queen until the birth of the child, and the Venetians took control of the Regency Council. The Greek population had endured the pesky Lusignans, and did not care who between the Latins was the master, but the nobility was apalled, and soon started conspiring with the Catalans in the court.;x

He had the support of the Catalan party in the court, and he obtained a letter from the anti-Venetian Pope Sixtus VI denouncing Andrea Cornaro and Marco Bembo as murderers of Jacques, addressed to one of the conspirators, the archbishop of Nicosia, Luis Perez Fabregues. With Napolitan reinforcements the coup took place. The Catalans killed the uncle and cousin of Queen Caterina and her personal surgeon in front of her eyes and kept her prisoner. The plan was to marry Charla, illegitimate daughter of Jacques, to Alonso, illegitimate son of Ferrante that had been adopted by Charlotte. But the Venetians were not going to sit still, and they sent a military expedition to rescue Caterina. The conspirators jumped into the Napolitan galleys and left the island. If the conspirators had had more support, perhaps they would have stayed, but that would mean a war with Venice for sure. But it would be a better idea to marry Alonso to Caterina;x

EVENTHIST154017;The tragedy was not finished for young Caterina Cornaro. At 20 years of age she had seen too many people die, but now it was her son, the King Jacques III Lusignan who died while she was preparing his first birthday party. With him, the Lusignan dinasty became extinct. It also meant the last of the Frankish Kingdoms in Levant and the end of a dream built over blood. By virtue of having named her -Daughter of St. Mark-, Venice became the heir of the Kingdom of Cyprus, but only under condition for her to not re-marry or have any children. Her destiny had also been sealed. Her life would be spared, but her freedom had disappeared. She would always be watched and controlled. Perhaps due to her tragedy, Caterina won the love of her Greek subjects, that for the first time supported a Latin ruler.;x

EVENTHIST154018;The Venetians were always worried that Cyprus could be lost when they were so close to get it, and only their relationship with Egypt stopped them. With time they were starting to get more and more nervous. They even removed, Marietta Patra, mother of Jacques II together with the three illegitamate children of her son, Eugene, Jean and Charla as prisoners to Padua in 1476, where Charla, who had signed a marriage contract with Alonso of Naples, died soon after. But Caterina was still young, and there were always talks of diplomats attempting to get to her with marriage offers. Ferrante was entertaining the idea of marrying her to Alonso, a plan she could have favored. Nothing could actually happen, since she was not allowed out of sight, and she could not sign a paper without permission. But the growing Ottoman menace and Ferrante's plans moved Venice to accelerate the take over.;x

He is willing to marry Caterina if we support him. He would implicate us in Italian policies.

Finally we have been able to find a heir to the Byzantine empire, Boniface III Palaeologus, margrave of Montferrat.

Faced with the lack of land, the Le dynasty looked towards the south where their long time enemies, the Kingdom of Champa, owned fertile deltas. In 1470, after more than 1000 years of conflicts, the Dai Viet began preparations for a final war against the Champa Kingdom.

EVENTNAME157001;Foundation of the Le Dynasty;x
EVENTHIST157001;The Ming administered the country as if it were a province of China and ruled it harshly for the next twenty years. The forced labor of its people was used to exploit Vietnam's mines and forests solely for China's enrichment. Taxes were levied on all products including salt a dietary staple. Under the Ming, Vietnamese cultural traditions, including the chewing of betel nut, were forbidden, men were required to wear their hair long and women to dress in the Chinese style. Vietnamese Buddhism was replaced at court by Ming-sponsored neo-Confucianism, but Ming attempts to supplant popular Vietnamese religious traditions with an officially sponsored form of Buddhism were less successful. Le Loi, one of Vietnam's most celebrated heroes, is credited with rescuing the country from Ming domination in 1428. Born of a wealthy landowning family, he served as a senior scholar-official until the advent of the Ming, whom he refused to serve. The oppressed people found a new leader in the person of Le Loi, a man renowned for his courage and generosity. Under the title Prince of Pacification, he organized a resistance movement from his village and waged a guerrilla war against the enemy. By employing a strategy of surprise attacks targeting his adversary's weakest points, Le Loi managed to further weaken the enemy and at the same time to avoid combat with the superior Chinese forces. His enforcement of strict military discipline ensured that no pillaging was carried out by his troops in the regions under his control, making him a very popular hero. After a decade of gathering a resistance movement around him, Le Loi and his forces finally defeated the Chinese army in 1428. Rather than putting to death the captured Chinese soldiers and administrators, he magnanimously provided ships and supplies to send them back to China. Le Loi then ascended the Vietnamese throne, taking the reign name Le Thai To and establishing the Le dynasty (1428-1788). He renamed the country Dai Viet and immediately began the task of its reconstruction after the devastation caused by war. He reduced his army from 250,000 to 10,000 men and adopted a rotation system that enabled soldiers to return to the countryside to work and help boost food production. The legal system was reorganized and the penal system revised. A new College of National Sons (Quoc Tu Giam) was founded to educate future administrators, with admission based entirely on merit and not on the prior prerequisite of social or family status.;x

Under the new code, parental consent was not required for marriage, and daughters were granted equal inheritance rights with sons.

EVENTHIST157006;The Tay Son Rebellion (1771-1802), ended the Le and Trinh dynasties, and was led by three brothers from the village of Tay Son in Binh Dinh Province. The brothers were of the Ho clan (to which Ho Quy Ly had belonged), and adopted the name Nguyen. The eldest brother, Nguyen Nhac, began an attack on the ruling Nguyen family by capturing Quang Nam and Binh Dinh provinces in 1772. The chief principle and main slogan of the Tay Son was 'seize the property of the rich and distribute it to the poor.' In each village the Tay Son controlled, oppressive landlords and scholar-officials were punished and their property redistributed. The Tay Son also abolished taxes, burned the tax and land registers, freed prisoners from local jails, and distributed the food from storehouses to the hungry. As the rebellion gathered momentum, it gained the support of army deserters, merchants, scholars, local officials, and bonzes. By 1786 the Tay Son had overcome the Trinh dynasty and united the country;x

EVENTNAME157007;A New Emperor;x
EVENTHIST157007;In 1788 the reigning Le emperor fled north to seek Chinese assistance in defeating the Tay Son. Eager to comply, a Chinese army of the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) invaded Vietnam, seized Thang Long, and invested the Le ruler as King of Annam. To save the nation, the second eldest Tay Son brother, Nguyen Hue, proclaimed himself Emperor Quang Trung in Phu Xuan and overran the Chinese troops in a whirlwind campaign. Marching north with 100,000 men and 100 elephants, Quang Trung attacked Thang Long at night and routed the Chinese army of 200,000, which retreated in disarray. Immediately following his victory, the Tay Son leader sought to reestablish friendly relations with China, requesting recognition of his rule and sending the usual tributary mission. Quang Trung stimulated Vietnam's war-ravaged economy by encouraging trade and crafts, ordering the recultivation of fallow lands, reducing or abolishing taxes on local products, and resettling landless peasants on communal lands in their own villages. Quang Trung also established a new capital at Phu Xuan (near modern Hue), a more central location from which to administer the country. He reorganized the government along military lines, giving key posts to generals, with the result that military officials for the first time outranked civilian officials. Vietnamese was substituted for Chinese as the official national language, and candidates for the bureaucracy were required to submit prose and verse compositions in chu nom rather than in classical Chinese.;x

EVENTNAME157008;A Power Vacuum;x
EVENTHIST157008;Unfortunately, Quang Trung's promising reign was cut short by his premature death not long after, in 1792. Without leaving a successor strong enough to assume leadership of the country, the usual factionalism ensued. By this time, Nguyen Anh and his supporters had won back much of the south from Nguyen Lu, the youngest and least capable of the Tay Son brothers....;x

EVENTNAME157009;Ousting of the Macs;x
EVENTHIST157009;By the late sixteenth century the Trinh family had ousted the Mac family and had begun to rule the northern half of the country also in the name of the Le dynasty. In an effort to restore law and order to the territory controlled by the Macs, Lord Trinh left the southern court under the temporary control of Nguyen Kim's nephew, Nguyen Hoang, and set out for the north. After pacifying the north and re-establishing Le authority in Hanoi, Lord Trinh returned to find Nguyen Hoang well entrenched in the southerhn court as lord and master of all, and liking where he was. The Trinh, who, like the Nyuyen, took the title 'chua', spent most of the seventeenth century attempting to depose the Nguyen.;x

EVENTNAME157013;Gia Long and the Chinese model;x
EVENTHIST157013;In his drive for control and order, Gia Long adopted the Chinese bureaucratic model to a greater degree than any previous Vietnamese ruler. The new capital at Hue, two kilometers northeast of Phu Xuan, was patterned after the Chinese model in Beijing, complete with a Forbidden City, an Imperial City, and a Capital City. Vietnamese bureaucrats were required to wear Chinese-style gowns and even adopt Chinese-style houses and sedan chairs. Vietnamese women, in turn, were compelled to wear Chinese-style trousers. Gia Long instituted a law code, which followed very closely the Chinese Qing dynasty (1644-1911) model. Under the Gia Long code, severe punishment was meted out for any form of resistance to the absolute power of the government. Buddhism, Taoism, and indigenous religions were forbidden under the Confucianist administration. Traditional Vietnamese laws and customs, such as the provisions of the Hong Duc law code protecting the rights and status of women, were swept away by the new code. Taxes that had been reduced or abolished under the Tay Son were levied again under the restored Nguyen dynasty. These included taxes on mining, forestry, fisheries, crafts, and on various domestic products, such as salt, honey, and incense. Another heavy burden on the peasantry was the increased use of corvee labor to build not only roads, bridges, ports, and irrigation works but also palaces, fortresses, shipyards, and arsenals. All but the privileged classes were required to work on such projects at least sixty days a year, with no pay but a rice ration. The great Mandarin Road, used by couriers and scholar-officials as a link between Gia Dinh, Hue, and Thang Long, was started during this period in order to strengthen the control of the central government. Military service was another burden on the peasantry. In some areas one out of every three men was required to serve in the Vietnamese Imperial Army. Land reforms instituted under the Tay Son were soon lost under the restored Nguyen dynasty, and the proportion of communal lands dwindled to less than 20 percent of the total. Although chu nom was retained as the national script by Gia Long, his son and successor Minh Mang, who gained the throne upon his father's death in 1820, ordered a return to the use of Chinese ideographs.;x

EVENTNAME3917;The Lodi Dynasty;x
EVENTHIST3917;In 1451, reigning Sayyid sultan, Ala ud-Din Alam Shah freely abdicated his throne in favor of Bahlul Lodi. Bahlul was an Afghan noble and used the support of the other Afghans to help him ensure a rather smooth transition of power. The downside for Bahlul was that the Afghan theory of Kingship, viewed the King as merely one member of the collective ruling body of the nation. In return for their support, Bahlul was expected to appoint his supporters to important posts, necessarily entailing a curbing of his powers.;x

EVENTHIST161001;On the death of Sikandar Lodi, the nobles of Delhi saw a chance to increase their power by fostering a rivalry between Princes Ibrahim and Jalal. At the suggestion of the nobles presiding at court, Delhi was divided into two Kingdoms, that of Ibrahim in Delhi and Jalal in the east, with his capital at Jaunpur. Only a few days after Jalal had departed for Jaunpur, a group of previously absent nobles arrived at the court. They denounced the partition and quickly convinced Ibrahim to revoke the agreement. In response to the demise of his practically non-existent independence, Jalal declared war on his brother.;x

Daulat, like other nobles, feared treachery on the part of the Sultan and instead sent his son as an emissary. The cold reception of his son caused Daulat Khan to fear reprisal from the angry Sultan. He invited Babur, a Timurid prince of Kabul, to help him in out in his struggles against the Sultan.

During the reign of his father, Bahlul, the supporting base of Afghan nobles, who had helped Bahlul to take the throne, had been alienated. Under the Afghani theory of Kingship, the Sultan was no more that a slightly elevated member of the nobles in a collectively ran government. Bahlul had altered the dynamic by attempting to wean the nobles out of governmental affairs. The natural reaction of the nobles had been to refuse to assist him in times of war and an ever present danger of open rebellion. Sikandar Lodi, while a religious fanatic, was quite concerned with building up the infrastructure of his empire. Opposing the nobles would have made such reforms impossible.;x

EVENTHIST161005;The policies of Sikandar Lodi created a situation whereby the nobles were held great power. The Sultan, whenever he wanted to enact any change in policy had to first court the opinion of influential aristocrats, as they held powerful sway over the Kingdom. During the reign of Ibrahim Lodi, the Sultan's power had been so undermined that the powerful factions often acted as independent parts of the realm. The nobles then pushed for official recognition of their semi-indepedent status, which would enshrine their rights to greater control over their holdings.

EVENTHIST3283;Union King Erik was a harsh man, and his sheriffs reflected all of his worst traits. One of the cruellest was Jösse Eriksson, a nobleman of Danish birth and appointed sheriff of Bergslagen in Sweden. Acting like a petty chieftain, Jösse took whatever he fancied from the oppressed people - including their women. Finally, the peasants and miners had had enough and sent Engelbrekt to demand that Jösse be replaced by a decent man. King Erik agreed and sent an almost equally cruel sheriff, a German named Hans von Eberstein, to Bergslagen. The flames of revolt rose up in 1434...;x

EVENTHIST3284;The Sound Due was introduced by King Erik in 1429 and was not abolished until 1857. All ships passing through the Sound ('Øresund') were forced to anchor off Helsingør and pay dues to the Danish Crown. The merchants had no choice but to comply since the Sound was the only water lane into the Baltic Sea. The due was enormous, and its impact on politics was almost as big as on the economy - the Danish King could easily decide on different levels of tariffs for the various nationalities of the ships passing through. Swedish merchants were often particularly targeted, which was an important contributing factor to the bitter enmity between the nations.;x

In 1517 Christian accused the governor of Copenhagen Castle of poisoning his lover Dyveke, and thereafter he ignored the Rigsråd and the royal charter.

The mayors of Copenhagen and Malmö devised a plan together with the Hansa to free Christian II and turn the two largest Danish cities into partners of the Hanseatic League.

At the same time, there was a desire upon the part of the Danish monarch to play a dominant role in contemporary world trade, a desire that was apparently not always wholeheartedly endorsed by the Danish merchants of the period. In fact, the Danish trading venture proved to be without large or durable profits.

EVENTNAME3297;The Absolutism;x
EVENTHIST3297;Absolutism in Denmark was a result of the lengthy political crisis and the acute state of emergency which resulted from the last of the Karl Gustav wars against Sweden in 1657-60. Despite his weak position when elected King in 1648, Frederik III's political skill allowed him to succeed in ousting two of his main adversaries in the Rigsråd as early as the 1650s. The two were the seneschal Corfitz Ulfeldt and the governor of Norway Hannibal Sehested, who were both married to Frederik's half-sisters. The King's heroic conduct during the siege of Copenhagen in the winter of 1659 had, in addition, made him widely popular at a time when the nobility and the Rigsråd were increasingly being discredited. In October 1660, these events led the estates - the nobility only reluctantly - to create a hereditary monarchy. The new system meant that the King was no longer dependent on the Rigsråd, and he immediately used his new power to introduce absolutism, which was temporarily established on 10 January 1661 in the Hereditary Monarchy Act before being fully set out in Kongeloven (the King's Law) of 1665, the basic law of Danish absolutism.;x

After study and travel abroad in 1654-62, he returned to enter state service as royal librarian. Soon winning the favour of the absolutist King Frederick III, he became secretary of the King's chamber, in which post he drafted the 1665 Kongeloven ('King's Law'), which was a justification of absolutism. In 1670, the year of the King's death, Schumacher was made Count Griffenfeld. By 1674 he had risen to the post of high chancellor of Denmark under King Christian V.;x

EVENTNAME3300;The Great Northern Conflict;x
EVENTHIST3300;In 1697, the 15 years old Charles XII ascended the Swedish throne. Seeing the opportunity, the Russian Czar Peter I allied with Denmark and Poland-Saxony in 1699. However, with British and Dutch naval assistance, Charles XII landed on Zealand and promptly defeated the Danes, then moved to Estland where his badly outnumbered Swedes (1 to 5) won a crushing victory over the Russians. Instead of finishing the Russians, Charles moved against August II of Poland-Saxony and drove him out of Poland in 1704 (having the pro-Swedish Stanislas Leszinski elected King), then subjugating Saxony in 1706. While the Russians started the construction of St-Petersburg (1703) and rebuilt their armies, they also took parts of Estland (1704-1706). Charles then decided to march to Moscow via the Ukraine where the Cossacks under Mazeppa had again risen in revolt (1708). The harsh winter and Russian raids decimated his army and he was finally beaten at the battle of Poltava in 1709. The wounded King escaped to the Ottomans. The Russians were encircled by the Ottomans on the Prut River, but Peter succeeded through bribery to obtain a safe conduct in exchange for Azov. While Charles was still exiled in Turkey, Russian, Danish, Hanoverian and even Prussian troops captured most of the Swedish territory around the Baltic. Having emerged from Turkish internment, Charles got killed in 1718 in front of the Norwegian fortress of Frederickshald. The peace treaties that followed Sweden lost most of her Baltic empire.;x

EVENTNAME3301;Den Danske Lov;x
EVENTHIST3301;The concentration of power in the person of the King strengthened the tendency toward juridical unity in the entire Kingdom. On 15 April 1683 Christian V signed the Danish Law ('Danske Lov'), a comprehensive Statute Book, which represented a break with the regional juridical variations of earlier times (the provincial laws, or 'landskabslove'). In the Danish Law it was expressly forbidden to criticize the King, the government and Absolutism, while the situation was also maintained regarding censorship. Yet, the Danish Law of 1683 and Norwegian Law of 1687 were exceptional for their time in their uncommonly humane legislation. The peasant laws were also important, providing as they did tenant farmers with legal recourse against abuses by the landlords.;x

EVENTNAME3305;The Mercantile Reforms of Christian VI;x
EVENTHIST3305;Christian VI was a firm believer in heavy-handed mercantilism and large state controlled manufactories. Although his protectionist reforms did have a positive effect on the for Denmark all-important agriculture, they were mostly costly failures that retarded the commercial development of the nation for decades to come.;x

EVENTHIST3306;The serfdom, or 'vornedskab', was first abolished in 1702 (it was in use only on the islands), then re-invented for all of Denmark in 1733 under the name of 'stavnsbåndet' - male peasants below the age of 36 were forbidden to move from the manor without the consent of the landowner. (Less than 5 percent of the land was owned by peasants.) The new law had the effect of securing cheap labor for the nobles as well as a good supply of soldiers for the state but was, of course, intensely hated by the victims.;x

He banned theater performances on Sundays and holidays, and after 1738 actors and entertainers were not even allowed to enter the country. Frivolous amusements were also banned at court, but the royal couple's love of splendor led to costly buildings, such as Christiansborg Castle (built 1733-45).;x

EVENTNAME3308;The Regency of J.H.E. Bernstorff;x
EVENTHIST3308;In 1766 Christian VII was crowned King of Denmark, succeeding his father Frederik V. Christian was unfortunately quite insane. His mental instability has been attributed to a brutal childhood governor and to morally corrupt court pages. After his 1766 marriage to Caroline Matilda, the daughter of Frederick, Prince of Wales, he gave himself up to debauchery. During his entire reign the country was run by others. First up was the foreign minister J.H.E. Bernstorff, a devious and competent man who managed to get Catherine II of Russia to renounce certain of her claims to parts of the duchy of Holstein. However, Bernstorff's position grew increasingly precarious and he was dismissed from office on Sep. 15, 1770.;x
#;x
EVENTNAME3309;The Regency of Struensee;x
EVENTHIST3309;Johann Friedrich Struensee took over as the real ruler of Denmark after Bernstorff was dismissed. Originally a German physician, Struensee came to know the Danish King when he was named to accompany the mentally unstable Christian VII on a European tour (1768-69), a post that led to Struensee's appointment as court physician in 1769. Dominating the King, he became the lover of Queen Caroline Matilda in 1770. He was soon able to abolish the council of state and the office of statholder (governor) of Norway in 1770. In June 1771 he had the King name him privy Cabinet minister, and in July he was made a count. From March 1771 until January 1772 Struensee introduced a number of reforms, including freedom of the press, reduction of peasant labor service, a unitary judiciary, and reform of Copenhagen's municipal government. Having alienated many officials,however, he was the victim of a conspiracy in January 1772, when he was arrested and tortured to death for his liaison with the Queen.;x

EVENTNAME3310;The Landbo Commission;x
EVENTHIST3310;In 1784, by order of the crown prince, Count Ludvig Reventlow drew up a plan to improve the conditions for the serfs ('fæstebønder'). The plan was approved on Jul. 18 and the so called Landbo Commission was appointed to see to its execution. Thanks to the strong leadership of Reventlow, a compassionate humanitarian, the original commission was expanded in 1786 and, through gradual improvements and temporary setbacks, eventually led to the complete abolishment of serfdom ('stavnsbåndet') in Denmark in 1800.;x

EVENTNAME3311;The Great Agricultural Reform;x
EVENTHIST3311;Denmark was and is primarily an agricultural nation, and it was one of the first to adopt the new farming methods and tools that were invented in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Fields were reallotted, improved ploughs were used, crop rotation was introduced and new high-yield crops (potato, Indian corn) from the new world were taken into wide use. Not all of the reforms were greeted with joy by the peasants, but the most unpopular by far involved the splitting of villages into separate farms so that the peasants could live closer to their fields.;x

EVENTNAME3312;The Regency of Ove Høegh-Guldberg;x
EVENTHIST3312;Høegh-Guldberg was of humble background. He earned a theology degree in 1753, and in 1761 became professor of rhetoric at Sorø academy. He was appointed tutor to Prince Frederik, half brother of the future King Charles VII, in 1764. As Frederick's private secretary in 1771, he shared Frederik's hostility to Count Johann Friedrich Struensee, then supreme in Denmark through his domination of Christian VII - Høegh-Guldberg took part in a conspiracy that led to Struensee's arrest and execution in 1772. Thereafter, Høegh-Guldberg, along with Prince Frederik and the dowager Queen Juliana Maria, gained significant power in the Danish state. In 1774 Høegh-Guldberg was made confidential cabinet secretary. Soon, without consulting the other council ministers, he was issuing orders signed by the incompetent Christian VII. He took over control of foreign policy after dismissing foreign minister Count A.P. Bernstorff in 1780. Høegh-Guldberg was forced out of power during a 1784 coup d'état led by Prince Frederik.;x
#;x
EVENTNAME3313;The Regency of A.P.Bernstorff;x
EVENTHIST3313;Recalled to office in April 1784, Bernstorff, until his death, served as foreign minister in a moderate liberal government. He supported a series of reform measures including the regulation of landlord-peasant relations and the emancipation of the serfs. In foreign affairs, Bernstorff carefully pursued a policy of neutrality. When the French Revolution broke out, he condemned any interference in the domestic affairs of France and avoided every anti-French coalition. In March 1794 he negotiated a neutrality treaty with Sweden for protecting the merchant shipping of both countries by combined squadrons. Bernstorff's foreign policy won him the respect of European diplomats - his domestic policy gained him such popularity among the Danes that his death (June 21, 1797) was regarded as a national calamity.;x

With financial help from the King of Denmark, he went on to set up an observatory on the island of Hveen in Copenhagen Sund. The observatory, called Uraniborg, was equipped with exceptionally large and accurate instruments. At Uraniborg Tycho made twenty years worth of astronomical observations. Tycho intended that this work should prove the truth of his cosmological model, in which the Earth (with the Moon in orbit around it) was at rest in the centre of the Universe and the Sun went round the Earth (all other planets being in orbit about the Sun and thus carried round with it).;x

EVENTHIST159036;When Gustav Vasa tried to claim the throne of Sweden and withdraw the country from the Kalmar Union, he faced a massive unexpected resistance from the Swedish nobles. The end result was that Sweden proclaimed their everlasting support of the Kalmar Union. This gave King Christian an opputunity to proclaim a united union and integrate Sweden into his other holdings, however this would lead the unrest both in his current holdings and in Sweden. In the former because the nobles didn't want to share the power to proclaim a new King with the Swedish, and in the latter because this would be seen as an end to Sweden as a independent country.;x

EVENTHIST159040;The first phase of the Thirty Years War saw the defeat of the rebellious protestant nobles of Bohemia who were punished severely and their lands expropriated because of their decision to depose Ferdinand of Austria in favor of the Protestant Palatine elector as Bohemian King. Consequently religious persecutions began in Bohemia to eradicate Protestantism from that land. To penalize Friedrich V of the Palatinate and to reward Maximilian of Bavaria, Ferdinand deprived Friedrich of his electorate and of the Upper Palatinate and granted both to Bavaria. That was an obvious violation of imperial law, but since no German prince was really in a position to defy Ferdinand and Maximilian, it was done and Maximilian had achieved a recognition proportionate to his power. An attempt to help the Lutheran rulers of neighboring Lower Saxony made by King Christian IV of Denmark who, himself a Lutheran and, as Duke of Holstein, an Imperial nobleman, feared that Denmark's sovereignty as a Protestant nation was being threatened. The Danish army had to face the fiercer imperial troops formed by mercenaries under the command of Albrecht von Wallenstein, who was given by Emperor Ferdinand II free hand in pillaging all the territories his army would have crossed or captured from the enemy.;x

Sweden became so strong that Denmark could not contain its neighbour any longer despite having owned lands all around Sweden (Norway, Skane, Gotland) but had to accept the loss of Jämtland, Gotland and the remains of its Baltic possessions. Halland (western part of Skane) was ceded to Sweden for 30 years as pawn that Denmark fulfilled the conditions of the treaty.;x

EVENTHIST159045;Following the wars against the counts of Holstein the unrest in Sweden was very high due to the war taxes imposed by Erik. In 1434 this resulted in major rebellion in northern and central Sweden. Erik had no choice but to sign a treaty that severely reduced his power in Sweden or face a full-scale Swedish war. He ended up signing the treaty and was now obliged to heed the advice of the Swedish State Council as well as only allow Swedish nobles to govern Swedish provinces.

Bonaparte continued his military campaign by attacking the Turks in Syria but both desease and short supplies which weakened his soldiers and the bad news coming from France forced him to leave Egypt abandoning there his troops. Successfully dodging the British fleet constantly patrolling the Mediterranean in search of French presence, he managed to make return to France. Letting alone and without command and precise orders, the French troops found themselves at the mercy of the British troops better fitted and supplied. Even if they managed to win some battles they eventually surrendered to the British, however they were taken home by means of the British navy itself.

It required that justices devote part of every quarter session to acknowledgment of the areas in which they themselves are particularly weak.

EVENTNAME3018;The Northern Rebellion;x
EVENTHIST3018;Queen Elizabeth I sought to bring about a religious settlement with the objective of establishing in England a protestant Anglican Church. History records that her task was accomplished with the minimum of persecution (just the right amount of persecution perhaps?). Things however began to fray around the edges when Mary Queen of Scots fled to England, seemingly because the Scots got fed up with her mismanagement of Scottish affairs. The problem for Elizabeth I was that Mary was a catholic claimant to the English throne and therefore more than a bit of an embarrassment. So Elizabeth I locked Mary away in various castles. Mary became the centre of numerous conspiracies to overthrow the 'upstarts' who had displaced the ancient aristocracy. The basic idea was to marry Mary to Norfolk, England's only Duke. This combination represented a serious threat to Elizabeth I but Norfolk seemed undecided and continued to delay until Elizabeth I invited him to London whereupon she locked him in the Tower. Elizabeth I had correctly suspected that the Earls of Northumberland, Westmorland and Cumberland were involved in the conspiracy and accordingly invited them to London. The Earls guessed their accommodation would be the Tower and opted instead for a rebellion which began on the 9 November 1569. There was some popular support. The Catholic faith had survived in the North and there was real resentment against the extension of Tudor domination and Elizabeth I. The Earl of Northumberland did muster his troops in Richmond on the 16 November offering great wages to all who came forth and burning for those who did not. On 28 November the annoyed Earl of Northumberland returned with 1000 horsemen and 'spoiled' the town. Around the 23 November a few wealthy inhabitants willingly joined the rebellion (just as it neared collapse). This defection did not go unnoticed and this time the other side led by Lord Willoughby ransacked the surrounding countryside. Sir George was appointed provost marshal and martial law was declared (except of course for the wealthy that was exempt). Elizabeth I ordered that 700 of the riffraff be executed (the wealthy would forfeit their estates to help fund the Crown's costs), 200 of these were to be from or around Richmond. On the 8 January the provost marshal arrived. Questioning of the prisoners began and on the 10 January the executions were carried out. How many were actually executed is not known but seemingly it was a smaller number, perhaps around 57, 12 of whom were from Richmond. The decade after the Rebellion was a difficult period for Catholics who faced constant persecution. Religious meetings were held in secret away from the eyes of unfriendly informants. It seems however that the few gentry who were accused in court of holding Catholic beliefs were the 'mere tip of a great pyramid' which represented a hidden underground movement.;x

Dissatisfied with the English government's persistent policy of playing the chiefs against one another, O'Neill was also angered by the English refusal to restore the lands granted to his grandfather. At last he formed an alliance with the other Irish chiefs and sought aid against Protestant England from Catholic Spain. He achieved something like unity among his allies and, after 1595, defeated some of Queen Elizabeth's best commanders in Ireland. O'Neill was defeated while attempting to join a Spanish force that arrived at Kinsale in 1601. His Irish allies dispersed, and O'Neill retreated to Ulster. In 1603 he made peace with the English, surrendering his tribal authority. King James I later pardoned him.;x

EVENTHIST3024;The 16th century saw the number of members in the House of Commons increase, while the House of Lords remained significantly smaller. The power base in Parliament shifted to the House of Commons who were well aware of the fact. Elizabeth I had a mix of determination, majestic presence and kindness towards the members of Parliament that her successors James I and his son Charles I did not. The Parliament wanted to have more said in matters about the church, justice and taxes to which the King naturally opposed. When James I tried to propose marriage of his son to Spanish, and later a French princess (both Catholic) they had enough. The Parliament of 1628 voiced the Petition of Right which forbad arrests and taxation ordered by the King. In 1629 the Parliament voted for resolutions to condemn Religious and Tax politics and the King opposed the Parliament and tried to dissolve it. Eleven years of Dictatorship ensued.

EVENTNAME3025;The English Civil War;x
EVENTHIST3025;The English Civil War (1642-1648) was the result of a long power struggle between the Stuart monarchs and the Puritan-led Parliament. Intensification of royal judicial procedures (Star Chamber) and demands for taxes (1635, ship money for naval construction) was faced by Parliamentary opposition (summary of grievances in the 1641 Grand Remonstrance) and execution of royal advisors. The arrest of John Pym, the Puritan leader and the Catholic uprising in Ulster (1641) sparked the war between the Royalists and the Parliament. The decisive reform and new model army of Oliver Cromwell (1599-1658) led to the capture and execution of King Charles I (1649) and the establishment of the English Commonwealth, a military dictatorship controlled by a Lord Protector (Cromwell - 1653) and a reduced (Rump) Parliament. Following successful wars against Holland (1652-1654) and Spain (1654-1659), the monarchy would be re-established by General Monk in 1658, to the profit of Charles II Stuart (1660-1688), a fervent absolutist.;x

It was mostly directed against the Dutch carrier trade and provided that all goods shipped to and from England were to be transported on English ships, while also confirming the colonial exclusive policy. The Act directly caused the first Anglo-Dutch war of 1652-1654 and the second in 1665-1667. At the Peace of Breda (1667), New Amsterdam (New York) was exchanged for Surinam (Dutch Guiana) and the Act was slightly modified.

Parliament was summoned. The Army started to rumble. A new Lord Protector by the name of John Lambert was suggested, but his role would be more of a military dictator than a protector. The people of good standing were poised with either a plundering army or a coalition between the army and political and religious radicals. A return to Monarchy, even with Bishops and House of Lords, but with guarantees for law and order started to sound like a good alternative. Cromwell's trusted man General Monk walked to London with his Army and Charles II was elected as King in 1660 after giving guarantees for amnesty and army salaries and the role of Parliament.;x

In addition to personal reasons, any King who supported Catholicism could count on the support from France. In fact, Charles II got his reward in form of a large sum of money in a Treaty closed behind the back of the Parliament. Around the same time Parliament issued the Bill of Test which again excluded dissenting religious groups (including Catholics) from public offices and allowed persecution. The Parliament subsequently raised the issue of excluding the openly catholic James II from succession rights.;x

He openly worked for Catholicism and his own well being and with methods unacceptable to both Tories and Whigs alike. In 1688 Parliament called for Mary Stuart, James' staunchly Protestant daughter to usurp her father and found a newer, more constitutional form of monarchy. The so-called 'Glorious Revolution' was a bloodless coup hastened by the approval of the Bill of Rights, which stated important limitations to the royal authority: the Queen couldn't levy taxes, own personal armies, change state religion, pass laws without Parliament's consent and grant free elections for the renewal of the representatives in the Parliament. The Constitutional Monarchy was eventually born.;x

EVENTNAME3032;The Absolution;x
EVENTHIST3032;After Charles I had won the English Civil War he set out persecuting the Puritans, many of whom moved to the American colonies. He also closed Parliament and ruled by decree which created dissent among most groups in the English society. His son Charles II, however, fully understood that the moderate Protestants were the key group and he needed them badly. By introducing religious freedom, disqualifying religion as an issue when attaining a governmental post, and creating an ideology of the Monarch as standing above all religious issues, he managed to create a feeble truce among Englishmen. As a consequence Charles revived Parliament, but greatly diminished its powers. Furthermore, Charles set high standards ensuring fair and regular elections and that every one was equal under law. His brother James was a staunch Catholic and not particularly fond of the opposition that had deified a lot of his ambitions. James, influenced by the Duke of Tyrconnell and the Earl of Sunderland, had the Tory leader, Earl Danby propose in Parliament that the royal suspension power was to be abolished if Parliament passed a Declaration of Rights. In a masterly executed scheme the Whig leader, Earl Shaftsbury, made the proposal fall. King James was outraged and held a speech in Parliament informing the Commons that either he would govern as the appointee of God or they pass a redrafted Declaration of Rights. The choice was theirs and theirs alone. Finally after days of negotiation Parliament accepted what would be called the Bill of Rights, creating a division of powers between Parliament, an independent Star Chamber and the King. Parliament would create and pass laws, and control certain taxes as tax of income and wealth, while the King would approve laws and direct the foreign policy, execute wars and control the majority of taxation. Thus the venerable series of events known unto history as 'The Absolution' came to be. By the early 1690s, James II enjoyed the same level of power and influence as his cousin, Louis XIV of France, and never again would Parliament be in a position to flex its muscles at the House of Stuart...;x

By the end of September, most of the Highlands were in his control and his army numbered some 5,000 with more appearing daily. But all this was done without even notifying the King they were claiming to support. The Old Pretender, King James III, was not even aware of the situation as of yet. Word was sent to the King, and the size of the force continued to grow. The Earl, with his growing army, moved to Perth and established his base there after taking the city. Meanwhile another Jacobite army was forming to the south, The Old Pretender hearing the news began to make preparations for his trip to Scotland and his crowning. By early November, the northern Jacobite army numbered some 12,000, mostly Clansmen from the Highlands. The Earl then decided to march south where he soon met the army of the Duke of Argyll, the only remaining government troops in Scotland. The Jacobite forces were mismanaged and split. The southern army marched south to raise Lancashire instead of turning on the Duke of Argyll's flank, while a much smaller force under the Duke defeated the larger northern army of the Jacobites at Sherrrifmuir on November 13th. The southern army was also met and defeated at Preston by other government forces in England. The Jacobites were forced to retreat to Perth, while still waiting for their leader to arrive. The Old Pretender finally arrived in Scotland on the 22nd of December after leaving fittingly enough from Dunkirk. But the matter was already settled, as the Duke of Argyll was already receiving reinforcements of experienced troops and was preparing an overwhelming force to march north. The King, James III, was again forced to retreat after spending a dismal six weeks in Scotland.;x

Additionally, he claimed he was tortured and threatened with death.

He and his Jacobite supporters managed to beat an English army at Prestonpans on October 2nd, 1745 and entered Edinburgh where he had his father James recognized as King of Scotland. At the head of a small army, he then invaded England as far as Derby, but had to retreat when promised French support did not materialized (the intended landing of French troops had failed). Caught up by the British army under Cumberland (recalled from the Low Countries), he is soundly defeated at Culloden on 16th April, 1746.

Out of the struggle between the Thirteen Colonies and their mother country emerged two nations: the United States and what would later become Canada.

Most so-called 'Americans' still felt themselves being different from the average Londoner, but King George's rule was just and fair. Slowly the insurrectionists attacks started to strike back at themselves as ordinary people started to view them as brigands. In pace with their failure to get support they become more radical and when the French Revolution appeared they happily picked up that ideology of violence and hatred. The Reign of Terror in France and the British problems in Quebec quickly made ordinary people to flock to the English banners. The British Government seized the initiative and issued the Act of the North American Union. All colonies would now become province with their own parliament fully empowered for local governance. The same would be true for the Motherland. The British Government in London and the Grand Parliament would now also accept and include members from the North American Union.

The Anglo-French and Anglo-Spanish competition did not make the things easier for the colonists as the French and the Spaniards induced the Natives to raid and sometimes provided guns and leadership. In this situation His Majesty's Government in London had two possibilities. Either to invest in a perimeter defense of forts and garrisons or let the colonials form into militias and solve the defense on their own.

EVENTNAME3752;Bosworth Field;x
EVENTHIST3752;Richard III had many enemies, and on 7 August, Henry Tudor landed near Milford Haven with about 2,000 French mercenaries and a handful of Lancastrian lords and knights. He gathered reinforcements as he marched through Wales, then through Shrewsbury, Stafford and Atherstone. Richard was at Nottingham, and moved from there to Leicester on 19 August, and by 21 August the two armies were facing each other about two and a half miles south of Market Bosworth. Richard's army was just under 12,000 strong, but 4,000 of his troops were commanded by the Stanley brothers, whose loyalty was suspect. Henry had only 5,000 troops. During the battle Both the Stanleys turned neutral and withdrew to a defensive position just north of the battlefield, swinging the numerical strength if not to Henry's favor at least improving his situation. The battle was fought on and around Ambion Hill, close to Sutton Cheney, and lasted only two hours. Richard had the better position, but did not take advantage by attacking Oxford while he was still deploying his troops. This allowed Oxford to launch the first attack and the Duke of Norfolk, who was commanding Richard's forward battle division, was soon desperately pressed. For the first hour, the fighting was evenly matched, but Richard lost the battle through the treachery of the Stanleys, who deserted his cause. Even more damaging was of the Earl of Northumberland's failure to bring Richard's reserves into action when he saw the Stanleys withdrawing from the battlefield. Richard made a last attempt to win victory by directly attacking Henry with is personal guard, and almost succeeded, having cut down Henry's standard bearer. Richard's gamble failed, and he was struck down. The battle ended when Richard died. The Stanley brothers and Norfolk immediately started to negotiate with Oxford. Henry fearing that the conflict would spread attended the meeting bringing an end to the miseries of England. It was decided that the Dukes of England was to take part of Government and support their new King, Henry VII Tudor.;x

Some elements can be found in Cromwell's New Model Army, but also the question-marks of a possible pro-French Stuart Dynasty and/or if England had managed to keep some of its French possessions.

EVENTNAME3771;King Charles and the New Monarchy;x
EVENTHIST3771;During the reign of Charles I England's loyalties were divided between Parliament and the King. Parliament wanted more pluralism and Protestant supremacy, whilst the King, spurred on by the influence of his French Queen, wished to revert to the supremacy of Rome and the Divine Right of Kings, or at the very least, religious freedom for all. In 1645 the New Royal Army formed by Fairfax won two important victories, at Naseby and at Langport, destroying all of Parliaments' armies. In 1646, Charles had little choice but to spread his remaining forces into 'hunt-and-destroy' parties seeking out fleeing Puritan leaders. Oxford pressed the newly formed 'New Model Army' of Oliver Cromwell, forcing them to seek refuge with the Scots, bringing the first war to a close. Charles used the time to negotiate with Parliament, spending vast sums of the Exchequer bribing moderate Parliamentarians. In the mean time, Cromwell's army began to feel their feeble relation with the Scots deteriorate. Eventually the Puritan army tried to kidnap King Charles, however, Charles escaped and used this 'vile and contemptuous habit' to his advantage. Then, Cromwell's army marched south (Aug 1647) and debated proposals of their own with the refugees of the Parliament at York. Charles took advantage of this shift of emphasis away from him to negotiate a new agreement with the Scots, again promising church reform. This agreement leads to a series of Puritan rebellions and an ambitious offensive by Cromwell's Army (Jul 1648). However, all were checked by the far more powerful Royal Army under Fairfax. The New Model Army, angry that the majority of Parliament still considered Charles as King, marched on Parliament and conducted Pride's Purge (named such since the commanding officer of the operation was Sir Thomas Pride). 45 MP's were arrested, 146 were kept out of Parliament, and only 75 were allowed in, and then only to do the Army's bidding. This Rump Parliament was ordered to set up a high court of justice in order to try Charles I for treason in the name of the people of England. Charles took action and surrounded the Cromwellian army, smashing it to dust, freeing Parliament and enforcing his will upon it. At the Great Trial of Treason (Jan 1649) hundreds of Puritan leaders were found guilty and beheaded. Oliver Cromwell then lead the minuscule remnants of his New Model Army to Hull where he was arrested by the Sheriff of York, but escaped to Sweden after offering the City of York his baggage train in exchange for his life. Cromwell later fought with distinction in the Swedish-Polish War, but was fatally wounded at Warsaw in 1656. Charles I was once again King of England, Scotland and Ireland. His promise to the Scots was never fulfilled and in March the Church of England was formally returned to the Church of Rome.;x

The sovereign on his part was obliged to protect his subjects. Failure to do so would allow the people to seek a new ruler.

In mechanics his three laws of motion the basic principles of modern physics resulted in the formulation of the law of universal gravitation. In mathematics he was the original discoverer of the infinitesimal calculus.

EVENTHIST5057;The scientific environment created by men such as Hooke, Halley, Flamsteed or Newton led to the creation of institutions devoted to the research and discussion of scientific problems. The origins of the Royal Society lie in a group of men who began meeting in the mid-1640s to discuss the new natural philosophy. Its official foundation date is 28 November 1660. The Society was to meet weekly to witness experiments and discuss what we would now call scientific topics. It was Moray who first told the King, Charles II, of this venture and secured his approval and encouragement. The Royal Greenwich Observatory was founded on 22 June 1675 by King Charles II, upon request by John Flamsteed and other astronomers, and was built specifically to do work which would help to solve the problem of finding longitude while at sea.;x

EVENTNAME5058;Finding the longitude at sea;x
EVENTHIST5058;The problem of finding the longitude at sea was of the highest importance. During the 17th century there were many proposals, usually very sound from a theoretical point of view, but very impractical. In the 18th century England decided to attack the problem. Between 1690 and 1707 there were a number of incidents in which English naval ships were lost at sea because they had lost their positions. In 1714 Parliament set up a Committee whose members included Newton and Halley to report on the longitude problem, and thought the time had come to make a radical move and on 16 June 1714 they passed an Act 'for providing a publick reward for such person or persons as shall discover the longitude... to a sum of ten thousand pounds, if it determines the said longitude to one degree of a great circle or sixty geographical miles... and to twenty thousand pounds, if it determines the same to one half of the same distance'.;x

EVENTNAME5059;The longitude problem has been solved;x
EVENTHIST5059;According to Newton, the most promising method for finding the longitude at sea was the clock method, which was to eventually to succeed. Basically the clock was set on departure and kept an absolute time which could be compared with the local time on arrival. The east/west distance travelled could then be calculated. The problem was the inexactitude of the clocks at that time. Finally John Harrison built an extremely precise clock, his first clock was built in 1715, and by 1727 he had made a very fine clock with a 'gridiron' pendulum which consisted of nine alternating steel and brass rods to eliminate the effects of temperature changes (the clock is now known as H1). H2 was built in 1739 with further innovative features. Finally H4 was completed in 1761, and satisfied all the conditions. The problem had been solved!;x

After the boy recovered from cowpox, Jenner injected him with smallpox. Luckily, the experiment proved a success, and the boy proved to be immune from smallpox. After repeating the demonstration, Jenner published his results and vaccination (from the Latin words 'vacca' for cow and 'vaccinia' for cowpox) quickly became a widespread practice.;x

Although its first name was 'Georgium Sidus', in honour of the King of England, the name Uranus was proposed by Bode in 1850 in order to continue the use of classical mythology. The british astronomer was a patient, careful observer, who visually scanned the entire northern sky with the largest reflecting telescope of his era, constructed by himself. The two Uranus' largest moons, Titania and Oberon, were also discovered by William Herschel in 1787.;x

EVENTNAME5062;Darby and the coke process;x
EVENTHIST5062;In the 17th century the growing demand for iron was frustrated because the timber for making charcoal (the fuel used for blast-furnaces) was scarce and expensive, and large furnaces were not feasible because charcoal was too soft to support a heavy charge of ore. Raw coal was an obvious alternative, but the presence of sulphur in it spoilt the quality of the iron. At his Coalbrookdale works in 1709 Darby solved this problem by using coke, which burnt cleanly. Smelting iron with coke was a key process in the development of the Industrial Revolution.;x

EVENTNAME5063;Newcomen and the steam engine;x
EVENTHIST5063;In 1712 Thomas Newcomen, appointed to the maintenance of a primitive steam engine in the Cornwall mines, introduced some radical improvements in the engine's efficiency, already attempted and to some extent successfully achieved by Thomas Savery in 1698. This improved engine was used to pump water from the coal mines, an important problem faced by every mine. The engine of Newcomen was a big and expensive one, but it could pump 45 litres of water in each pumping cycle, thus being more efficient than Savery's original project, the socalled Miners' Friend.;x

EVENTNAME5064;James Watt and the industrialization;x
EVENTHIST5064;The Newcomen engine, successfully introduced in early XVIIIth century in the English minining industry, was the first step towards industrialization in England but its drawback was unfortunately its high energy losses. Only in 1769 in Birmingham the Scot James Watt managed to greatly improve this engine with various devices, like the ball regulator. The Watt steam engine represented a key element in the industrial revolution. In the following decades it generalized the use of engines in the factories, boosted the productivity and completely modified the productive processes. Nevertheless, its social consequences would be very problematic.;x

EVENTHIST5065;The most important social change due to the steam engine was the development of 'machinism', i.e. the change from artisanal production to industrial production. The steam engine allowed the factories to free from their dependance on running water and to settle near the cities. These cities grow rapidly and the first problems arose: unhealthy living conditions, unemployment, etc. Soon important revolts appeared: in march 1811 the great luddite revolt broke out, with the aim of destroying all the machines, perceived as the origin of the social problems.;x

The marriage arrangement cemented a period of truce between England and France, and for this Suffolk elevated to the rank of Marquess. However, Henry had corresponded with King Charles VII and Rene. He had promised Charles to return to Rene the county of Maine. To this end, Suffolk was compliant, and the Queen pushed every chance she had to lobby for her father's sake. Nevertheless, Henry delayed relinquishing the county, however, and Charles's patience was wearing thin. Henry found it difficult to simply give away lands his father, uncle, and his own commanders had fought so hard to retain. Henry's own uncle, Humphrey Duke of Gloucester, had campaigned in that region and would certainly be enraged if an entire county had been ceded without a fight. Extraordinarily, Margaret had arrived with no dowry, and indeed it would appear that Henry was now going to pay a dowry to the Duke of Anjou instead...;x

Henry was in no position to put up a fight, and so he eventually ordered the governor of Maine to surrender the county to Charles's forces. However, the Governor refused to do so, and suspected that the orders were fraudulent. It seemed incredible that his King would simply hand over an entire county to the French.

EVENTHIST21000;By the mid-16th century, the English policy of ruling Ireland indirectly and from a distance was believed to be a failure. The dissolution of the monastaries in Ireland accentuated religious and cultural differences. Risings in Offaly and Leix convinced the government that the Irish were incorrigible and could not be trusted. An alternate policy was to be followed: the Irish were to be removed. The process of clearing the Irish out to make room for English settlers, known as plantations, began in 1556 with the clearances of Offaly and Leix, which were renamed Queen's County and King's County. The process of plantation soon spread through Ireland, and caused both misery and outrage, and became a long-standing Irish grievance against English rule.

EVENTNAME21001;The Ulster Plantation;x
EVENTHIST21001;Early in the 17th century the process of plantation reached its peak of intensity in Ulster, where not only was the settler population the highest vis-a-vis the native Irish, but the settlers were Scottish Presbyterians, who were particularly opposed to the Catholic Irish. The result was a bitterly divided Ulster that was increasingly unlike the rest of Ireland. Meanwhile, the Ulster Plantation became one more grievance against the English.;x

EVENTNAME21004;Irish Act of Union;x
EVENTHIST21004;By 1800, England desired to centralize rule over Ireland at Westminster. They also wished to be rid of the troublesome Irish Parliament and its constant demands for increased autonomy. The English government used its patronage and control of the rotten boroughs in the Irish Parliament to get it to vote itself out of existance, and the Irish Act of Union was adopted. However, the abolition of the Irish Parliament was not to become a bone of contention with the Irish people until long after 1820.;x

EVENTNAME21006;Pitt the Younger or Charles James Fox as Prime Minister;x
EVENTHIST21006;William Pitt the Younger, who became Prime Minister in 1783, led England into the era of the wars with Revolutionary and Napoleonic France. Though earlier he had been a reformer, during the period after 1790 he became a reactionary and a conservative, suppressing radical dissent and moblizing the nation for war. His primary opponent was Charles James Fox, a leading Whig. Fox and his Whig allies advocated political reform and other liberal causes. When the Revolution in France broke out, Fox, true to his liberal principles, supported the changes across the Channel.;x

EVENTHIST21007;In January 1792, the London Corresponding Society was established to agitate for parliamentary reform. Soon, affiliates were established in Manchester, Norwich, Sheffield, and Stockport. These and other such societies were open in their support of the French Revolution, and the London Corresponding Society presented addresses of support to the French Convention in November 1792.;x

EVENTHIST21008;As Pitt's government suppressed radical dissent, Thomas Hardy, a leader of the London Corresponding Society, was put on trial for high treason, along with John Thelwall and Horne Tooke. However, the manoeuver backfired, as the jury acquitted the defendents of treason. The result was a major blow to Pitt and his government.;x

EVENTNAME21009;The Raising of the Volunteer Militias;x
EVENTHIST21009;As the war against Revolutionary France continued with worsening results, England confronted a rival employing radical methods and mass armies as the means to victory. Pitt was faced with the prospect of England standing alone against the French, with England vulnerable to invasion. Pitt decided that Volunteer Militias needed to be raised along the coast to assist in the defence of the Home Islands. These militias, comprised of both middle- and lower-class men, were numerous, even if their effectiveness, never tested in battle, was questionable.;x

EVENTNAME21010;Pitt's Taxation Reforms;x
EVENTHIST21010;In 1797, as the war with France continued, Pitt faced a mounting budget deficit. He devised a plan by which the land tax, long the mainstay of English public finance, was eliminated, and replaced by an income tax. This change signalled the beginning of modern taxation methods and efficiency. This new tax was first levied in 1799.;x

EVENTNAME21011;Reaction to the Reign of Terror;x
EVENTHIST21011;As the French Revolution degenerated into anarchy and murder, many in England were revolted.

EVENTNAME21030;The Elizabethan Religious Settlement;x
EVENTHIST21030;After the turbulance of Mary's reign, Elizabeth desired to restore stability to England and reaffirm the Protestant nature of the Church of England. At the same time, she did not want to alienate the significant number of English Catholics, and hence designed a religious settlement that appealed to both Catholic and Protestant moderates. The Elizabethian Act of Supremacy affirmed that she was the 'Supreme Governor of the Church of England', not the 'Head of the Church of England', as her father had been stylized. The Elizabethian Act of Uniformity created a single Protestant Book of Prayer, but allowed the communion to be vaguely worded, so that both Catholics and Protestants could participate. Despite the moderate tone, Parliament only passed the Act of Uniformity by a vote of 21 to 18, revealing that deep religious divides still cut through England.;x

EVENTNAME21041;Drake's Circumnavigation;x
EVENTHIST21041;In 1577, Sir Francis Drake was commissioned to sail to the western coast of the Americas to seek treasure and spices. After passing the Strait of Magellan, he caught the Spanish completely by surprise. For months, Drake sailed up and down the Pacific coast of the Americas, sacking towns like Lima and Valparaiso, and seizing the galleon 'Cacafuego', with its large cargo of treasure. Drake then crossed the Pacific and returned home to England.;x

EVENTNAME21043;Drake's Triumphs;x
EVENTHIST21043;In 1585 and early 1586, Sir Francis Drake, operating with letters of marque from Elizabeth, conducted a series of operations that electrified England and infuriated Spain. He raided Vigo, the Canaries, and the Cape Verde Islands, then crossed the Atlantic and attacked Hispaniola and Cartagena. He returned to England with a vast amount of plunder.;x

EVENTNAME21045;English Support for the Dutch Rebels;x
EVENTHIST21045;As the Dutch rebellion gathered steam, Elizabeth came under pressure to come to the aid of the Dutch.

Through dishonest means and speculation, the stock soared, and the company promised to take over 60 percent of the national debt. The attractive interest rates drew investors in droves, and the stock soared from 128 to 1000 from January to August 1720. This was the Bubble, which burst later that year, dropping the stock to 124, ruining both great and small investors.

EVENTHIST21062;Almost from the moment the Navigation Act was adopted, ways were found to circumvent the restrictions imposed by the Act. Enforcing mercantilism became increasingly expensive and difficult, and smuggling became endemic. Local depressions or surpluses increased the pressure for local interests to be granted special treatment. Often it was easier to surrender to such demands than oppose them. Irish linen in 1704, sugar destined for Europe in 1739, and southern rice in the 1760s all were exempted from the provisions of the Navigation Act.

EVENTHIST21068;Transportation as a punishment for an offence first began during the late 1600s. The rudimentary English prison system was woefully inadequate for the numbers convicted of offences, and hence the relocation of convicts to the colonies acted both as a safety value on domestic dissent and unrest, while providing a labour force for the new colonies.

Frustrated and finding themselves isolated from the King's inner circle, the two men established contact with several prominent Lancastrian exiles and concocted a plot to remove Edward and 'readept' Henry VI, since Hexham a prisoner in the Tower of London.

Having gained control of the capital (and quietly disposed of Henry VI), Edward turned west to meet another threat. Margaret of Anjou and her son the Lancastrian Prince of Wales had landed with a French-financed army in the southwest and were marching toward the Midlands. On May 4 Edward intercepted and defeated this last hope of the House of Lancaster at Tewkesbury, and according to legend killed the Prince of Wales with his own hand at the high altar of Tewkesbury Abbey.

EVENTHIST21110;After the success of his political coup at Stony Stratford, Gloucester had a free reign in the everyday upbringing of the King, not to mention an unparalleled level of influence over his decisions. Having pleaded with the Queen to release the ten year-old Duke of York from his sanctuary at Westminster, the royal brothers were inturned in the Tower, the traditional residence of a king before his coronation, and in no way sinister or against the ordinary. From here, Gloucester's decisions proved fatal. He was undisputed ruler of the kingdom. According to legend, like de Montfort before him and Cromwell after, Gloucester was asked numerous times to take the crown so as to ensure stability . Eventually, he accepted, though it would of course be naïve to suggest his actions had never taken this into account from at least Hastings' execution, if not right from Stony Stratford. June 1483 was forever the month that  blackened the name of Richard of Gloucester and ultimately sealed the fate of his dynasty. The actions of the man known unto history as King Richard III were at no point a foregone conclusion. On the one hand, Gloucester was a skilled administrator with a proven record of military success, in particular during the Anglo-Scottish war. His arguments for claiming the throne were simple, . Moreover, argued Richard, his nephews were both bastards by virtue of their father's alleged pre-marriage contract. he could provide England with firm and stable leadership. The young Edward was undeniably his father's eldest son, legitimate or not. Could Richard rule as Lord Protector until King Edward came of age, or murder his own flesh & blood and take the throne for himself, risking rebellion, anarchy and complete diplomatic isolation in the process. Not until the days of Oliver Cromwell would an Englishman wield so much power with such devastating results.;x

EVENTNAME21111;The Lancastrian Succession;x
EVENTHIST21111;In the decades after Towton Henry VI reigned but did not rule, the real power in the land being Queen Margaret of Anjou and her favourite, the Duke of Somerset. Meanwhile, the Prince of Wales, the ever-warlike Edward of Westminster, grew to a sickly, arrogant and frivolous manhood, dying alongside his guardian (and, some would say, father) the Duke of Somerset in the midst of the second of Jack Cade's popular rebellions. Henry VI enjoyed a long and futile reign, whilst his second son, Prince Edmund, died before him, in July 1483, of consumption and gall at the long wait - so that when the aged but less than revered monarch passed away, he was succeeded by his nephew Henry Tudor, the seventh of the name.;x

EVENTNAME21114;Raleigh's First Colonial Effort in North America;x
EVENTHIST21114;In 1584, Sir Walter Raleigh, a veteran of wars in France and a favourite of Queen Elizabeth, was authorized to undertake the foundation of a colony in North America. Barred from voyaging to North America, he sent several associates to scout a suitable area for settlement. The following year, the first effort was made to plant a colony on Roanoke Island on the Carolina coast. However, the colonists arrived too late to plant crops, rapidly grew disinterested, alientated the natives, and left the following year with Sir Francis Drake when the latter visited the colony.;x

EVENTNAME21115;Raleigh's Second Colonial Effort in North America;x
EVENTHIST21115;In 1587, Raleigh again attempted to plant a colony in North America. Colonists were dispatched to Chesapeake Bay, but ended up again on Roanoke Island. The Spanish Armada prevented any supply ships from reaching the colony for three years. By the time ships were able to return, the colony and the colonists had completely disappeared. No trace of them was to be found. At the same time, Raleigh was also involved in the Irish Plantations, sending colonists to his lands in the south of Ireland, and helped to popularize tobacco, which increased interest in further colonial efforts in North America.;x

EVENTNAME21116;Raleigh's Orinoco Expedition;x
EVENTHIST21116;In 1595, Raleigh personally led an expedition to the Orinoco River in South America, in the hopes of finding El Dorado. The expedition was a disappointment, and Raleigh came home empty-handed. He increasingly fell out of favour, and was imprisoned by James I in 1603, and was executed in 1618 after another failed expedition to the Orinoco.;x

EVENTNAME21117;Buckingham and Prince Charles embarrass the Crown;x
EVENTHIST21117;In 1623, George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, and Charles, the Prince of Wales, travelled to Spain in hopes of cementing Anglo-Spanish relations with a marriage of the young prince to the Spanish infanta. Buckingham was snubbed by the Spanish court, and the infanta unimpressed by the juvenile and overblown antics of the prince. In addition, Spain was unwilling to marry the infanta to a protestant. Charles and Buckingham returned to England angry and full of anti-Spanish sentiment, and agitated for war. Parliament favored Buckingham and the Crown Prince, and granted James a subsidy for the purposes of making war on Spain. The failed marriage negotiations with Spain eventually led to Charles' marriage to Henrietta Maria of France.;x

EVENTNAME21118;Charles I and Henrietta Maria of France;x
EVENTHIST21118;Following his rebuff by the Spanish in pursuit of the infanta, and believing that an alliance with France was necessary in the event of war with Spain, Charles, as newly crowned King of England, married Henrietta Maria. The marriage caused outrage in the parliament, because Charles, while still Prince of Wales, had sworn before both Lords and Commons that he would not marry a Catholic. In response, parliament severely curtailed Charles' military appropriations and his traditional 'tunnage and poundage' tax. The blame for Charles' marriage to Henrietta Maria, however, fell on Buckingham, who responded with an attempt to plunder Cadiz.;x
#;x
EVENTNAME21119;The Raid on Cadiz;x
EVENTHIST21119;With Charles I still angry over his rude treatment at the hands of the Spanish court and Buckingham eager to regain popularity after the marriage of Charles to Henrietta Maria, a decision was made to sack the city of Cadiz. The expedition was a costly failure. Although English troops made it ashore, they did little plundering and much drinking, and the Royal Navy proved to be in a state of shabby disrepair. Parliament, angry over the failed expedition, blamed Buckingham, and called for his impeachment. To save his minister, Charles dissolved the parliament in spite of not receiving the appropriations he needed. Sir John Eliot, a leader in Commons was placed in the tower, and Charles resorted to the largest forced loan in English history to finance his government. Twenty-Seven members of Commons were jailed for refusing to contribute to the loan, and the cost to Charles in terms of the goodwill of the merchants and the gentry were enormous.;x

EVENTNAME21120;Buckingham Aids the Huguenots;x
EVENTHIST21120;Eager to redeem himself after the failure of the attack on Cadiz, and taking advantage of existing antagonism towards France, Buckingham assembled a fleet of ninety ships and 10,000 men to relieve the besieged Huguenot city of La Rochelle. Like the Cadiz expedition, the La Rochelle adventure was ill-conceived and poorly executed. An already dangerously antagonized parliament was further outraged by Buckingham's latest blunder, and ultimately responded with the Petition of Right.;x

The landscape of the Highlands had already been tamed with a network of military roads. The clan chiefs were encouraged to become absentee landlords in Edinburgh or London.

When Thomas Cromwell issued commissions to close the monastaries of the region, they were infuriated and rose in revolt under the leadership of Robert Aske. The rebels were numerous and managed to seize York and were joined by most of the gentry and many of the northern councillors. The Duke of Norfolk, with a small force to suppress the rebellion, promised to refer the grievances of the rebels to Parliament, but this did not amount to anything, and 200 rebel leaders, including Aske, were eventually executed.;x

To prevent continued religious struggle, the Act of Settlement was signed, determining that every English King had to be a member of the Anglican Church, i.e. a Protestant.

When the personal union with Holland had ended in 1702 (death of William of Orange), his daughter Queen Ann (1702-1714) reigned but failed to provide a legitimate heir. The English crown went to George I of Hanover (1714-1727), her most direct parent. He and his son George II (1727-1760) were German born and would always follow closely the fate of their Electorate, making it in fact if not in law a vassal of England.;x

EVENTHIST164000;Since 1646 there were economic relations between the British East India Company and Oman. When Napoléon sought to challenge British commercial and political activities around the Indian ocean by his Egyptian campaign, the British government reacted to the threat by offering the Omani Sultan Sâîd I a closer cooperation. Sâîd agreed, and in 1798 and 1800 two treaties were signed. Oman became an important base for the Royal Navy and came under effective political domination of Britain, despite formally being no protectorate or in some kind of unequal relation. Under the sovereignty of Great Britain, Omani trade and colonization flourished and it was the wealthiest and most powerful Arabian country.;x

EVENTNAME164001;William Blake;x
EVENTHIST164001;William Blake was born to a middle class family in London on 28 November 1757. Blake worked in his father's shop until his talent for drawing became so obvious that he was apprenticed to an engraver at the age of 14. Finishing his apprenticeship at the age of 21, Blake set out to make a living as an engraver. Blake, however, was not much of a businessman and much more interested in exploring the mystical visions he claimed he had. He explored his visions through his poetry, which was all printed with accompanying illustrations engraved in copper plates (through a method he claimed he 'received' in a dream. Although Blake's poetry was never recognized by many during his life, he was sufficiently intriguing to the elites to belong to a circle of radicals in London which included William Godwin, Mary Wollenstonecraft and Thomas Paine. Blake was a revolutionary that especially hated the doctrinaire attitude of organized religion, 'Remove away that black'ning church:/Remove away that marriage hearse:/Remove away that place of blood:/You'll quite remove the ancient curse' but hated Voltaire and Rousseau just as much for they were prophets of the unspiritual, the rational and scientific life. Blake's poetry paved the way for the transcendentalism of later poets (especially in the United States) and, paradoxically, represented the anti-intellectualism which was so important to the advent of nationalism and the 20th Century's totalitarian states. He also was one of the first writers to react to the Industrial Revolution. His poetry and illustrations rank among the best ever produced in the West. His most famous series of poems today are 'Songs of Innocence/Songs of Experience', which was first printed in 1783. He died in 1827 and was buried in an unmarked grave.;x

EVENTNAME164002;The Marriage of Henry VI and Margaret of Anjou;x
EVENTHIST164002;Henry VI's marriage to Margaret, the daughter of Rene I Duke of Anjou, had cemented the truce of Tours between England and France. Because of Rene's extreme poverty, Margaret brought with her no customary dowry whatsoever. William de la Pole, then Earl of Suffolk, was primarily responsible for the marriage, yet Henry had been sufficiently pleased enough to elevate the Earl to the rank of Marquess. Henry's council was largely headed by Suffolk and backed by the Beauforts, and seemed an indominable group. However, no one seemed prepared for Henry's own venture into foreign politics. The King had promised Charles VII and Rene I the counties of Maine and Anjou and was now pressured to deliver them. Henry VI had dithered to the point that Charles VII now threatening resumption of hostilities. When Henry VI ordered the formal surrender, the governor of Maine could hardly believe it.;x

EVENTHIST164004;The seizure of Fougeres by the English precipitated an invasion by Charles VII that expelled the English from the vast majority of France. The events at Fourges are shrouded in controversy. However, it is known that Francois de Surienne, an aragonese mercenary who had risen to become a Knight of the Garter as well as one of Edmund Beaufort's senior commander's in France, had led the army that had sacked Fougeres. Thus it was relatively simple for Charles VII to make the connection between the two, despite Somerset's denial of prior knowledge. Moreover, with the Duke of Brittany having sought Charles VII's aid, the French King was anxious to press and exercise his perceived rights of feudal lordship over Brittany, even in their more subtle forms.;x

Hence, in the Beaufort's actively sought to solidify a marriage between James and their neice Joan Beaufort. Their efforts were successful and in February of 1424 James and Joan celebrated their marriage at Southwark with a banquet in the bishop's diocese.;x

EVENTNAME164006;The King of Scots is Crowned;x
EVENTHIST164006;James I's Coronation occurred at Scone and was a display of restored royal prestige. James was installed on the throne by his old tutor, Bishop Wardlaw of St. Andrews, and Murdac I Duke of Albany as Earl of Fife, in accordance with customary procedure. After the ceremony, James conferred knighthood on Duke Murdac's favoured son, Alexander, and several of James's nobles, including the Earls of Wigtown, March, and Angus, his southern allies. This display of renewed monarchy and feudal harmony encouraged English hopes for James. With James on the throne, Henry VI's Regency could feel secure in knowing that England's northern border was safe from significant Scottish invasion for at least the next few years...;x

In addition the guet was levied, a hearth tax to pay the troops. The peasants in Normandy suffered fromt he English garrisons -- foraging, looting and kidnapping for ransom, and the patis. By now, the plundering grew still more oppressive. The English freebooters and ecorcheurs laid waste to peasant life across the Norman lands. Lancastrian France was becoming a wilderness laid waste by its garrisons, by deserters, by erocheurs and by Dauphinist raiders. At the end of the 1420s, the revenues from Normandy began to fall drastically, with vast swathes of fertile and arable lands now barren and deserted. A series of bad harvests only exacerbated the crisis, fuelling a bread shortage and adding to the peasants' misery. It would not be long before a series of revolts would break out across the vast Duchy territory...;x

EVENTHIST164009;As a result of interrupted communications and exposed supply routes, together with harassment by brigands and peasants, many Parisians were starving. Bedford had returned to Paris early in 1431 amidst widespread famine. He had brought with him some seventy barges laden with food which provided merely a temporary respite from the daily misery of the people. The price of wheat had doubled and many now cursed the Regent, not only in private but in public as well. Charles had been anointed at Rheims not too long before, and Cardinal Beaufort had been desperate to counter the development. Henry VI arrived in Paris and was to spend little time there. Cardinal Beaufort presided over an ill-managed ceremony that was conducted tactlessly.

EVENTNAME164010;The Anglo-Corsican Kingdom;x
EVENTHIST164010;In open revolt against the new radical policy decided in Paris, Pasquale Paoli turned naturally towards England for two reasons at least. Firstly, he had been welcome in London during his twenty years exile (1769-1789) and had established good relations with many political men over there. Secondly, England was at war with France since 1 February 1793 and would be very much interested in gaining strategical ports and strongholds in the Mediterranean Sea. On 3 September 1793, the first English ships were sighted before Bastia, under Admiral Horatio Nelson. The negotiations then begun and on 16 January 1794, an agreement was found which contented both parties. English troops first landed on 17 February and the last two pro-French cities Bastia and Calvi surrendered on 21 May and 11 August. In-between, the Constitution was officially adopted on 19 June. After many hesitations, King George III finally appointed his leading negotiator with Paoli, Sir Gilbert Elliot, instead of Paoli himself as a Viceroy on 4 October.

Licencious and corrupt, yet extremely clever and efficient, his dealings finally caught up with him after he ordered the execution of a rival. Investigated and condemned for corruption and murder, he managed to escape to France and later to England, were he was well received by Elizabeth. In his desire of revenge against Felipe, Antonio Perez treasoned his own country, helping Elizabeth in her fights against Spain. The attack on Cadiz by Howard in 1596 was helped by the insider information provided by him. He even traced plans for an invasion of Naples by England. However after the disaster of the English fleet that attacked the Azores, Antonio Perez lost the Queen's favour and returned to Paris.

EVENTNAME164013;The English Armada;x
EVENTHIST164013;In 1588, Felipe II of Spain, tired of constant attacks to his fleets, cities and colonies by English corsairs, and outraged by the help lend by Elizabeth to the Dutch protestants at war against him, decided to send a powerful fleet to invade England. Bad leadership, terrible storms and superior English naval tactics and cannons, turned the expedition into a disaster. The crucial point of the expedition, the embarkment of the Tercios of Alessandro Farnese, the Duke of Parma, near Calais, could not be achieved. The return trip was a nightmare due to bad weather and diseases, and almost half of the fleet was lost in the coasts of Ireland. It was a disastrous loss, but not a crippling one, as most of the ships lost were armed merchants and Mediterranean galleases. The Atlantic fleet was largely intact and under repair at the Northern ports of Spain. It was an opportunity too good to pass of leading a fatal blow to the Spanish naval power. But for England it was difficult to quickly obtain financing for such an expensive enterprise, and so the goals were expanded to attract new investors. The fleet was to destroy the Spanish ships under repair, to invade Portugal to trigger a rebellion and instate a Portuguese claimant in the throne, to capture the Azores, and to capture also the Spanish treasure fleet to compensate the expenses for a financially troubled England. Drake and Norris were put in command, but while the destruction of the Spanish fleet was the main goal to the Queen and Privy Council, it was the treasure fleet the foremost goal to the expedition participants. As a result the expedition was a disaster of a similar magnitude to the Spanish armada. Nothing of substance was achieved, and a military defeat at Lisbon, diseases and storms, decimated the fleet, that it is said to have lost 10,000 men. Despite the grave losses, it was worse the missed opportunity, as the Spanish fleet recovered and in the next decade dominated again the seas, shipping three times more gold than the previous decades, while England suffered a chain of defeats: the repulse of Effingham in Azores in 1591, the disastrous raid to Puerto Rico and Panama in 1595, also with great loss of lives, including Hawkins and Drake, the landing of the Spaniards in Cornwall in 1595, and the failure of the Islands Voyage to Azores by Essex in 1597. As a result, James I would seek peace with Spain in the same terms offered by Felipe II prior to the Spanish Armada.;x

EVENTNAME164014;The second treaty of San Ildefonso;x
EVENTHIST164014;After the first treaty of San Ildefonso, Spain became a reliable ally for France in her wars with England, however Spain suffered the worse part. Her navy was seriously damaged, and her vital commerce with her American colonies was interrupted, strangling her economy, and she was finally forced to sue for peace. This situation left Napoléon's navy in a complete inferiority in the peninsula, as the British navy could use the ports in Portugal, her traditional ally. Napoléon needed Spanish collaboration to win the war at sea, however Spain, now at peace with England wanted to remain neutral. To Napoléon, Spanish collaboration was vital, not only to prevent shipping to England from Spanish ports, but also to enforce the blockade in Portugal. Spanish prime minister, Manuel Godoy, was given no choice, either with France or against France, and he vowed to Napoléon demands. England used the treaty as a justification to declare war to Spain.;x

EVENTHIST164017;The Spanish war of succession was also slow to end. Since Spain and Austria had not settled the issue and it was impossible to reach an agreement between all participants, it was decided that separate peace treaties between the parties would end the war. This decision, arranged between France and England, was favourable to England, who ignored the wishes of other members of the alliance, forcing them to follow suit. By the treaty with France on April 11, 1713, Louis XIV recognized the new King of England and confirmed the renunciation of Felipe's claims to the French throne. Hudson Bay territory, Acadia, St. Kitts and Newfoundland were ceded, and the demolition of the fortress of Dunkirk agreed. By the treaty with Spain on July 13, England obtained Gibraltar and Minorca, and a monopoly on slave trade with the Spanish colonies for the next 30 years. England international standing was increased by the peace of Utrecht, and her commercial empire took a big leap, displacing that of the Netherlands, that entered a decline.;x

EVENTNAME164018;Crisis in Brittany;x
EVENTHIST164018;Brittany was the last of the great feudal fiefdoms of France that retained its old independence, and King Charles VIII of France and his Council were bent on completing the policy of Louis XI by annexing the Duchy. In England, there was a strong feeling against allowing such an important province to be added to the French Crown. Added to this, was the obvious strategic threat posed by a Breton coast under French rule. Nevertheless, the King was reluctant to go to war with France and instead preferred a diplomatic settlement. While the King and his Council discussed the developments in France, Lord Woodville, Governor of the Isle of Wight with a contigent of men crossed to Brittany and placed himself under the orders of Fracois II Duke of Brittany.

When Charles died without legitimate issue, his brother became King, raising concerns as any heirs of James II and Mary would be raised Catholics. Added to this were James's despotic tendencies and a formula for trouble was brewed. The birth of a son (the Old Pretender) alarmed the people even more and the Whig faction staged the 'Glorious Revolution' - deposing James II and Mary for James's Protestant daughter Mary and her husband William of Orange.

EVENTHIST164027;Born in London in 1772, Ricardo quickly became interested in economics and finances. At age 14, he joined his father at the London Stock Exchange, later becoming a stockbroker. Largely influenced by Adam Smith, he devised his own theories now considered foundational to the British Classical Economy School. His underlining of the roles of trade and international exchange, advocating the suppression of tariffs and duties and generally promoting freer trade are examples of this. It is thus no surprise that Ricardo was opposed to the Corn Laws (the prohibition on importing grain into England). One of his theories was that the value of goods depended mainly on the amount of work that went into its production. Ricardo's Theory of Value later influenced Marx, who linked it to his theme of the exploitation of the labourer's work. Ricardo also built the theory of the 'gold standard', recommending the issuing of money to be in close correlation with national gold reserves, in order to limit inflation.;x

EVENTHIST164028;In 1701 Queen Anne's son died, leaving the succession in doubt. The Parliament, which grew more and more powerful over the years as result of a stagnating monarchy which was completely disinterested in internal contrasts between Protestants and Catholics, started a frenetic session in order to decide which King the British throne would have come to. The current majority was formed by the Whig party which supported only members of the protestant branch of the House of Stuarts (Sophie, the the Mother of Elector George Ludwig of Hanover and granddaughter of King James I had the closest ties to the Stuart Dynasty), while the minority formed by the Tory party was supporting a more conservative choice, to call the catholic senior branch of the Stuarts back to the throne. James Stuart, legitimate ruler deprived of the throne during the Glorious Revolution has taken the opportunity to offer himself as a constitutional monarch and won over enough of Parliament to rise to the throne as James III.

EVENTHIST164035;Born in Halle in the same year as Bach, Handel studied with Zachau, and became a friend of Mattheson. In 1703 he was appointed violinist-composer for Hamburg's German opera. Handel sojourned in Italy in 1706 where he met Corelli, and both Scarlattis. His return to Hanover, four years later, was to assume the post of Kapellmeister to the Elector (soon to become George I of England). In 1712 Handel moved to London where, upon the accession of the house of Hanover, he gained immediate access to the royal circle of England. Handel's London years were occupied primarily with the writing of Italian operas. After suffering a stroke and the failure of his operas, due to cahnge in the public's tastes, Handel wrote oratorios, including 'Messiah' (1741). In addition to operas and oratorios, Handel wrote Psalms, motets, anthems, passions, cantatas, instrumental chamber works, and works for keyboard (primarily harpsichord).;x

EVENTNAME164041;The Great Plague;x
EVENTHIST164041;The Great Plague (1665-1666) was a massive outbreak of disease in England that killed 75,000 to 100,000 people, up to a fifth of London's population. The disease is generally believed to have been bubonic plague, an infection by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, transmitted via a rat vector. Other symptom patterns of the bubonic plague, such as septicemic plague and pneumonic plague were also present. Thought to have arrived from the Netherlands on merchant vessels, records state that deaths in London crept up to 1000 persons per week, then 2000 persons per week and, by September 1665, to 7000 persons per week. By late autumn, the death toll began to slow until, in February 1666, it was considered safe enough for the King and his entourage to return to the city. By this time, however, trade with the European continent had spread this outbreak of plague to France, where it died out the following winter. Nonetheless, a fifth of the city had been killed, resulting in an unprecedented loss of infrastructure and capital.;x

EVENTHIST164042;The fire of 1666 was one of the biggest calamities in the history of London, and came at the end of the Great Plague of London  an outbreak of bubonic plague that killed perhaps hundreds of thousands the Great Fire is thought to have brought a quicker end to the plague, by killing off any disease-carrying rats and their fleas. It destroyed 13,200 houses, 87 parish churches, 6 chapels, 44 Company Halls, the Royal Exchange, the Custom House, St Paul's Cathedral, the Guildhall, the Bridewell Palace and other City prisons, the Session House, four bridges across the rivers Thames and Fleet, and three city gates, and made homeless 100,000 people, one sixth of the city's inhabitants at that time. The death toll from the fire is traditionally thought to have been 16, but a recent book theorizes that thousands may have died in the flames or from smoke inhalation. Nevertheless, the entire city had to be rebuilt under the supervision of Sir Christopher Wren in the following years, thatched roofs were banned, and millions of pounds of infrastructure had been lost.;x

EVENTHIST164043;After what is commonly thought of as the single most disasterous period in the city's history, London had to be rebuilt almost from scratch after the Great Fire and Plague. During the 1670s, 80s and 90s, Sir Christopher Wren oversaw the reconstruction of England's devestated capital. 51 churches - including St Bride's, St Mary le Bow, St Clement Danes, St Benet Paul's Wharf, and St Stephen Walbrook were built to replace the 87 which had been annihilated by the fire. In addition, he was involved in the design of the Monument to the Great Fire of London, Royal Greenwich Observatory, Chelsea Hospital, Greenwich Hospital, Marlborough House, the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, the Wren Library of Trinity College, Cambridge, and many other distinguished buildings. Wren died in 1723 and was buried at St Paul's. An inscription inside his famous cathedral, dedicated to the architect, reads, ''Lector, si monumentum requiris, circumspice'' (''Reader, if you seek a memorial, look around you'').;x

EVENTHIST164044;In early XVIIIth century the Parliament, which was growing more and more powerful over the years as result of a monarchy almost disinterested in domestic affairs, started a frenetic session in order to decide which dynasty should be more suitable to represent less disrespectfully the country and deserve the British throne. The current majority was formed by the Tory party which supported the more conservative choice to confirm the current Stuarts on the throne, while the minority formed by the Whig party was supporting the German branch of the House of Stuarts (Sophie, mother of the Elector George Ludwig of Hanover and granddaughter of King James I had the closest ties to the Stuart dynasty).

EVENTNAME164045;The Execution of King Charles;x
EVENTHIST164045;The trial of King Charles I on charges of high treason and ''other high crimes'' began on 2 January, but the King refused to enter a plea, claiming that no court had jurisdiction over a monarch. He believed that his own authority to rule had been given to him by God when he was crowned and anointed, and that the power wielded by those trying him was simply that which grew out of a barrel of gunpowder. The court, by contrast, proposed that no man is above the law. Over a period of a week, when Charles was asked to plead three times, he refused. It was then normal practice to take a refusal to plead as pro confesso: an admission of guilt, which meant that the prosecution could not call witnesses to its case. In fact, however, the trial did hear witnesses. Fifty-nine of the Commissioners signed Charles' death warrant, on 29 January 1649. After the ruling, he was led from St. James's Palace, where he was confined, to the Palace of Whitehall, where an execution scaffold had been erected in front of the Banqueting House. Famously, Charles insisted upon wearing a second vest beneath his shirt that day, so as not to shiver, thus giving the crowd the false impression of fear. \nCharles I, King of England, Scotland and Ireland, was executed despite his son's efforts to save him. However, having England become a Republic, The Scottish Parliament was forced to act appointing his son, Charles II, as King of Scotland, England and Ireland on condition he accepted the Covenant, which Charles II had no option but to agree to. The refusal of the Scottish Parliament to reconsider their religious position against Anglicanism would be an excuse for Cromwell, member of the newly formed Council of State to invade Scotland. Within a year Scotland would be conquered, its Parliament abolished and the Scots forced into an incorporating union with England. Scotland would become an occupied country with Cromwellian citadels. The Parliamentary Union of 1652 and the birth of Commonwealth of Scotland, England and Ireland would however bring an uneasy peace accepted by the people for purely practical reasons.;x

EVENTNAME164046;The Olive Branch Petition;x
EVENTHIST164046;Following the Boston Tea Party and the English blockade of Boston harbour, the representatives from all of the American colonies on the East Coast subject to His Majesty except Georgia, assembled in the First Continental Congress in Philadelphia in September 1774 to discuss about following a common policy in defining their rights of British American colonists and suspending trade with the motherland, so distrusting the authority of a Parliament lacking American representatives. The following year, in a situation of internal conflicts between 'Patriots', rebels arranged in a local militia, and English regular troops, a Second Continental Congress was convened in Philadelphia, on 10 May 1775, with the participation of representatives of 13 colonies. Decisions were made about the creation of a Continental Army under the command of a Virginian planter, George Washington, to oppose the British and about signing a petition (Olive Branch Petition) to be extended to the crown and assure the King of England of the loyalty of the British American colonists, who were asking for reconciliation and resignation of His Majesty's ministers, clearly unable to meet their requests. But news of the English army successfully repressing the rebels in America came to Britain together with that petition so that the King firmly refused to intercede and redress colonial grievances. He issued the 'Proclamation for Suppressing Rebellion and Sedition' declaring elements of the American colonies in a state of open and avowed rebellion. There would be no negotiations whatsoever until the stipulation of the Treaty of Paris in 1783, with which England would formally recognize the independence of the Thirteen United States of America.;x

The exiled James VII ordered the convention to obey their rightful King, whilst the Scottish Parliament proclaimed William King of Scots and reclaimed their political power. Not all Scots accepted the new situation, there were supporters of the exiled Stuart dynasty, the 'Jacobites', which were assemblying forces in areas beyond government's control for the purpose of a counter-revolution. They believed that the natural order of Scottish society, with the rightful Stuart King at the top, was being destroyed by the Presbyterians. William of Orange wasn't particularly interested in Scotland as his life-long struggle was with Louis XIV of France and he relied on the money markets of London and Amsterdam to fund his war with the French. His invasion of England in 1688 was in many ways an indirect war effort against the French King. Scotland was either an irritation or a source of much needed troops to William.;x

EVENTNAME164058;The Lieutenancy of Ireland;x
EVENTHIST164058;Henry II had been the first English King to invade Ireland. The resulting Treaty of Windsor had established Henry II as Overlord of the island. Subsequently, a small but steady influx of English 'conquerors' carved out an area of land along Ireland's shoreline which would would later be called 'the Pale'. King John I was granted the Lordship when he was a boy, beginning a traditition that continued for centuries. Although John invaded Ireland and improved the administration and infrustructure of his English possessions, there was little he could do about the assimilation of English settlers into Irish culture. Moreover, his reforms had aggravated both the Irish and the Anglo-Irish. The scenario was not helped during Edward I's reign, as his warmongering had drained the Irish purse. Subsequently, during Edward II's reign, the Crown was forced to cancel the withdrawal of Irish funds for English expediture. Furthermore, the Scottish King Robert I's brother, Edward, invaded Ireland and proceeded to pillage the English lands there. Roger Mortimer, a wealthy English magnate with lands in the Welsh marches, was sent to Ireland as Edward II's response. Mortimer reconquered the English lands on the island, crushing Edward Bruce in the battle at Faughart in Ulster. Mortimer took Edward's lands and created Earldom of Ulster. By this time, however, Ireland was bankrupt and facing widespread famine. The various Irish Lordships possessed by English nobles were held by men who lived in England, and who rarely, if ever, visited their estates in Ireland. Attempts were made in 1297 and 1388 to coerce these absentee landlords into moving to Ireland permanently, through penalty and fine for those who would not. However, this merely served to convince many to sell their estates to Irish Kings, resulting in a further deterioration of English authority in Ireland. During Edward III's reign, his son, Lionel of Antwerp, Duke of Clarence invaded Ireland, but the sheer minority of English settlers all but rendered his efforts useless. Clarence recognized that the assimilation of English migrants into the Irish culture was undermining the Crown's authority, and so he issued the infamous Statutes of Kilkenny. The Statute was designed to segregate Englishmen from Irishmen with respect to law, language and custom. In practice, the Statutes were uninforcible and so they were widely ignored. The King's Justiciar remained largely powerless once the Royals left for England. The pattern of invasion and retreat repeated itself as Richard II and Henry IV both subscribed to a traditionally limited role in Ireland.;x

EVENTNAME164059;Suffolk's Impeachment;x
EVENTHIST164059;Parliament had been prematurely dissolved by Henry earlier in the year due to the Commons' determination to impose an Act of Resumption on the King and their unwillingness to grant Henry further taxation without it. By this time, public hostility and opposition to Henry's regime was high and there were several uprisings which had to be put down. In a subsequent Parliament, the Commons adopted the procedure of impeachment and used it against Henry's corrupt Chief Councillor William de la Pole, Duke of Suffolk, challenging the whole policy of the King's government. Henry himself openly favoured the accused, who made an emotional appeal to his King. Despite the Commons' desire for indictment and due process of impeachment and with rioting and unrest plaguing Suffolk's trial, Henry interfered and sentenced his minister to a temporary exile, without any formal verdict of guilt or innocence. In so doing, Henry had flagrantly excercised the royal prerogative in defiance of the Parliamentary proceedings and the justice the realm sought. Nevertheless, the harsh punishment Parliament had failed to obtain was to be provided by the commonality. Suffolk, on his way to exile, was beheaded by an Irishman with six strokes of a rusty sword. Although Suffolk was dead, the Commons would not forget Henry's attempt to save him, no more than they would retreat from the battle for Resumption. The King, far from submitting, resisted the Parliament's efforts until it was eventually agreed that Henry would reserve the right to exempt those whom he alone felt deserved such status. The Acts of Resumption were to be applicable to all of Henry's grants from the moment he assumed the throne on his father's death. Needless to say, many of Henry's Lancastrian supporters would find themsleves quite content. Some would even manage to gain from the act.;x

For a King who depended so heavily on the support of his nobles this was not going to be an easy measure. Disputes over several large and lucrative inheritances had fractured many of England's nobles into two factions that, if left unchecked, could embroil the realm with civil unrest and perhaps even civil war. As sovereign, Henry had final jurisdiction over whose lands would be resumed and whose would be spared. However, Henry had always been a weak King and so he fell easy prey to the ambitions and machinations of those in his own Court.

EVENTNAME164061;Cade's Rebellion;x
EVENTHIST164061;Adam Moleyns, keeper of the Privy Seal, was murdered early in the by soldiers awaiting transportation to France. He had attacked York's credibility not so long before, and Cuthbert Colville, an esquire in York's service in Normandy, had been party to the deed. In a seperate incident, William Aiscough, Bishop of Salisbury, was torn to pieces by his own parishioners. He'd been dragged from the church, where he had been saying Mass, to the top of a nearby hill and savagely slaughtered. It was widely held that both were covetous men, much hated by the common people, and were said to have promoted Gloucester's death. With these acts of mob violence in the backdrop, a formidable pro-Yorkist movement of Kentishmen revolted against Henry VI's government. The rebels were led by Jack Cade, a former soldier who claimed to be of Mortimer descent. The significance of the claim was twofold. First, Richard II had named Mortimer heir presumptive before his deposition and subsequent murder at the beheast of the Lancastrian usurper, Henry Bolingbloke, Henry VI's grandfather. Moreover, in accordance with England's laws of succession, Mortimer had been the legitimate heir. Second, the Duke of York was a descendent and the sole surviving heir to both the vast Mortimer Marcher lands in Wales, as well as their claim to the throne through Richard II's uncle, Lionel, Duke of Clarence. The majority of the participants of Cade's rebellion were yeomen, husbandmen, craftsmen, and small landowners from Kent, who objected to forced labour, corrupt courts, the arbitrary seizure of land by nobles, the loss of royal lands in France, and heavy taxation. The rebels defeated a small government force sent to disperse them, and then entered London where they were welcomed by those in the city who sympathized with many of Cade's aims. The rebels stormed the Tower of London, and despite failing to take the fortress, executed King Henry's treasurer, Lord Saye. The aims of the rebels were political, and a draft of their Proclamation of Grievances was heavily circulated throughout England before the rebels took to arms. The Proclamation had called for the return of the Duke of York to administrative capacity in the affairs of England, among other things, and an end to the poor governance of Suffolk and his hated affinity.;x

EVENTHIST164062;The Duke of York was widely thought to have played an instrumental role in the uprisings and general dissidence of the past few years. York's advisors and councillors were accused of indirect, if not direct, participation. The primary focus of Edmund Beaufort, Duke of Somerset, fell on William Oldhall - York's Chamberlain. Somerset had ordered Oldhall's arrest. Oldhall had responded by fleeing to St. Martins for sanctuary where he was subsequently taken by force at the behest of Somerset. the King's pious conscience must have played a part in his release several days after. Meanwhile, York had maintained his innocence, and was by now alarmed by the pressures placed on his Chamberlain. Believing it to be a matter of his own survival and that of England's, he decided to march on the King and have the Duke of Somerset removed from office and placed under arrest. Through his repeated professions of loyalty to King Henry, York declared his actions to be in no way directed against the King. A manifesto was circulated to most of the towns of southern England, and within days several copies had been forwarded to the King. Henry bade his realm to ignore the pamphlets and to obey only royal proclamations. Nevertheless, the political situation deteriorated further. York prepared to move in all haste. He gathered his tenants and retainers from estates spread across southern England and marched to London. Henry, unlike York, enjoyed the support of some sixteen lords with him including the Dukes of Buckingham, Norfolk, and Exeter, and made his way to Barnet. Throughout the various communicative efforts that followed, York maintained his loyalty, stressing that his targets were traitors within Henry's government. Outnumbered, York decided to make for a sympathetic Kent, where he hoped to add to the ranks of his retinue. However, Henry countered and arrived in Kent the day after York, leaving the Duke no time to recruit. Importantly, Henry was now accompanied by the Earls of Salisbury, and Warwick, and the Duke of Somerset, and their respective contigents. York and Henry's forces finally met at Dartford, where York held the field with insufficient forces to coerce the issue. And so, it was at Dartford that York, accompanied by the Earl of Devon, and Cobham, after some negotiations, presented articles of indictment against the Duke of Somerset, kneeling before the King to do so...;x

EVENTNAME164063;The Reading Parliament;x
EVENTHIST164063;Following Dartford, a panel of arbitrators were created to settle the dispute between York and Somerset. In the meantime, York was made to recite publicly a humiliating oath of loyalty to King Henry at St Pauls. The articles presented by York were aimed against Somerset and were designed to show that the political unrest in England was primarily the result of the King's failure to punish those who had lost France. It was undoubtedly a difficult case to promote, and the articles submitted did not establish the causal connection fully or convincingly. Charges that Somerset had put up an inadequate resistance in France, reduced garrisons, and failed to pay soldiers' wages could be explained by a chronic shortage of exchequer funds. York's strongest points, and those which carried the most substance, lay in Somerset's surrendering of fortresses not then beseiged, and an allegation that Somerset had kept 72,000 francs, which were given to him to pass on as compensation to those who lost rights and property in France. Regardless, to be obliged to take an oath was humilating enough, and for the Duke of York, there was little chance of saving face. Moreover, the panel of arbitrators was to be appointed by Henry and were thus weighted in favour of Somerset. The Crown was not without its share of legal indictments. While most of the Yorkists supporters at Dartford were pardoned, many were put on show trials to demonstrate the majesty of the King, the political pre-eminence of the Duke of Somerset, and the political feebleness of the Duke of York who was powerless to save those on whom he depended. Well over two thousand pardons were granted, as such was the scope of the Yorkist support and of the civil unrest in England. Not everyone escaped such light terms. Many of the gentry found themsleves stripped of their landed possessions, and ultimately attainted in a series of Parliamentary sessions culminating in the infamous Reading Paliament. In the meantime, despite the strong showing of support from the nobles at Dartford, trouble continued for the Lancastrian regime for the remainder of the year, as rebellions broke out in many shires and treasonous conspiracies were discovered in Yorkshire and Suffolk. Despite these instances of discontent, it was clear that the house of Lancaster had received the loyal support of the English nobility at Dartford in a sheer display of strength. York, fortunate to escape any formal charges of treason, was to be confined to his estates indefinately.;x

EVENTNAME164064;King Henry's Illness;x
EVENTHIST164064;King Henry, who was proposing to embark on a campaign of law enforcement in the provinces, had fallen ill and in this episode rendered catatonic. Somerset and his adjuvents did their best to conceal Henry's condition from the public. Nevertheless, as time progressed, the council could no longer hide Henry's absence and it soon became clear to all that his recovery could not be predicted. Thus, a Great Council was summoned late in October to which Somerset attempted to exclude York. However, the Earl of Salisbury and his son the Earl of Warwick intervened, and sent for York with instructions alluding to the fact that York was to be allowed to press a charge of treason against Somerset, who had for too long enjoyed Henry and Margaret's favour, to the general detriment of the Kingdom and to York. To remedy the current crisis, a series of Parliaments and Council meetings began in November and continued on through April of 1454. Initially, there were at least forty-six peers in London, and they jointly agreed to suppress lawlessness and not sustain each other in any lawless act. With the support of Norfolk, York had Somerset arrested and confined to the Tower of London. However, attempts to resolve issues of executive authority were delayed, mainly by Cardinal Kemp, Henry's Chancellor, who desperately hoped Henry would recover. Matters were further complicated when the Queen submitted a bill of articles, demanding the powers of a Regency, together with sufficient livelihood for herself, Henry, and their newborn son, Edward. The Queen wished to create a household government exercising the role of military Protector of the King and Prince, with sufficient income to sustain its authority and royal power to be exercised by Margaret herself. Fortunately for the Yorkists, Kemp passed away while Council and Parliament continued to mull over the Queen's proposal. On the following day, the Lords sought a sign of recovery from the King, and finding none, moved to establish York as Protector of the Realm. York was not without further difficulties, especially in the north, where Neville hostility towards the Percies found violent outlets. The youthful Duke of Exeter's bid for York's position would further distract the proceedings. Nevertheless, York would manage to secure a degree of stability throughout the realm and would make his first moves to reaffirm the base of support for his regime, however temporary it would be. Thus many Yorkists were ushered into England's government, including the Earl of Warwick's father, Richard Neville, Earl of Salisbury, who became Chancellor.;x

EVENTNAME164065;St. Albans;x
EVENTHIST164065;Just as suddenly as Henry had suffered his mental breakdown, he became well again. During his episode, the Queen had given birth to a boy, whom they had named Edward. The birth of a son strengthened the Lancastrian dynasty, but it hardly improved the immediate prospects for the realm, or for the Duke of York. York was natrurally displaced as heir presumptive to the throne. With King Henry's recovery, the Lancastrians sized the opportunity to isolate the Yorkists. Warwick, Salisbury and Devon, known Yorksits sympathizers fell to disfavour while the Lancastrians further profited at Yorkists expense. Fearing Henry's possible relapse, Somerset moved to settle the form of government to take place in such an event, and to this end, the summons of a Great Council to Leicester would be essential to give authority and dissemination to any proposed settlement. York had to prevent the Great Council from taking place. The duke of York retired north and, together with his Neville allies, no less alarmed than he, and raised forces. Upon learning of York's actions, Henry sent a deputation to York, but the emissaries were simply detained. Whether because of their failure to return, or some other military intelligence, Somerset woke up to the scale of York's military preperations and, accordingly, sent out summons far and wide. Within days, Henry and his loyal followers set out for Leicester. The Yorkists, however, intercepted the King's army en route, just north of London, near a town called St. Albans. Learning of York's location, Henry decided to relieve Somerset of his command, and appoint Buckingham in his stead. Follwing Buckingham's advice, they sought to negotate. The move for change in leadership was likely motivated by Henry's strong desire to avoid conflict, as Buckingham was related to York and was certainly a much more personable candidate. For Somerset this was a most unwelcome dvelopment, as negotiations could only concern his own fate. Henry and Buckingham's confidence in their strategy was boosted when the royal party were able to enter St. Albans unmolested, despite the town's potential for defence, the Yorkists having arrived earlier in the morning. The Dukes of York and Buckingham entered into serious negotiations immediately. However, both magnates were hampered by other issues. Somerset and Norfolk were deliberately provacative. York, on the other hand, was reserved and confined his request to the points at issue between himself and Somerset. York's insistence on the charges against Somerset put Buckingham in an impossible position, however, for as full as Buckingham's powers were, he could not concede what the King had already denied. Regardless, Somerset could scarcely be expected to co-operate. Warwick grasped the point and opened the fighting while the last embers of negotiation still flickered. Once the fighting had started there was no turning back. The King's banner was displayed, marking York and his supporters traitors, defeat now meant death and forfeiture. At some point during the battle, Warwick took a small contigent of archers and men-at-arms and flanked the Lancastrian forces. They entered the town through a gap in the Lancastrian defence and surprised the King's household retainers. In the ensuing struggle, Somerset was cut down with a pole-axe as were Lord Clifford and Northumberland. Henry and Buckingham were wounded and withdraw. The Yorkists found themselves the victors, located the helpless King, and subsequently proffessed their loyalty to Henry.;x

EVENTNAME164066;The Second Protectorate;x
EVENTHIST164066;At St. Albans York had fought to be rid of Somerset. Arguably, he had to, as Somerset sought his political demise. Since the first seeds of jealousy were sown in 1440 at York's appointment to the French lieutenancy, English politics had swung increasingly uncontrollably from the one interest group to the other. Somerset was not a great duke, and without Henry he could have been brushed aside by York. However, the King was insufficiently ruthless to completely sever his ties to Somerset, as Ministers who loyally discharged Henry's policies were loyally supported in return. The throne was not imperilled at St Albans. Immediately after the battle, Henry could have readily been killed behind closed doors with no witnesses to survive. Neverthless, the royal standard had been abandoned during the engagement and Henry and his Kingdom were in York's hands. In the months that ensued, instability had reigned, and so when parliament and Council met, it was largely concerned with restoring a degree of authority throughout the realm. Order was gradually restored within the realm, and a return of a favourable House of Commons brought the plums of victory to the Yorkists, though York took little reward for himself. The lords, however, made no progress in settling their various quarrels. For those who had been at St Albans there was an urgent need for a full, authorative, and final exoneration, such that they would be actionable in neither the criminal not the civil courts. The act which resulted was structured around the declarations of loyalty made before the battle itself. In casting Somerset as the traitor and the King as misinformed, St Albans became a loyal action, and by repeating, and enrolling, the letters written before the battle, York was, in effect, making a profuse declaration of loyalty to the house of Lancaster. Whatever the truth of his loyalties at St Albans, at Parliament he was the loyal subject of the rightful King, and this loyalty he publicly affirmed by an act of personal homage before Henry, and was followed in this by every other peer present. These apparent conciliatory actions brought some immediate assurance of York's loyalty, but it did nothing to dispose of the other legacy of St Albans, the internecine rivarly of the great families. It was simply beyond the power of the Upper House to heal their divisions. The need for the protectorate was soon pressed by the Commons and York was the unanimous choice. The opposition was either dead, or browbeaten into submission...;x

EVENTNAME164067;York's Resignation and the Queen's Coup;x
EVENTHIST164067;The terms of York's protectorate were similar to those imposed a few years earlier, however, Henry's deteriorated physical condition had warranted the introduction of an additional clause. Although York was to excercice authority with conciliar authority, he was only to be dismissed upon consent of the Lords themselves, in parliament. The duration of first Protectorate had been at the disgression of an enfeebled, catatonic monarch. Currently, Henry was not considered ill, and the need was to allow the lords to determine when the circumstances had arisen which would terminate the need for York's services. In typical medievil fashion they gave one definition of these, the majority of the prince of Wales, but the lords in Parliament were not anticipating so long a period. York had done well during his Protectorate, however, during the second parliamentary session, the Commons had pressed once again for resumption. York, with such a favourable Lower House, lent his support for such an act which did not take well to the lords. York had thus found himself in a precarious position, as his dismissal was subject to the discretion of the lords. With dissension at court and in parliament, and facing an increasingly hostile nobility, York resigned and soon retreated to his estates in Yorkshire. The lords once again supported Henry, if only to defend their lands from resumption. The realm meanwhile, would be racked with a series of revolts and skirmishes between feuding nobles. The government was itself going through a process of upheaval. The Queen had already determined to establish herself, together with the prince and their respective households, in the west Midlands, and Henry soon joined them. For the next four years England was to be governed from Coventry, but with the routine bureaucratic functions still discharged in Westminster. It was during this turbulent period that the Queen held a council meeting, and, taking the reins of Henry's household, staged a coup. She dismissed the Yorkist installed Chancellor, Treasurer and Privy Seal, and replaced them with Lancastrian counterparts. The Yorkists were now isolated, and thus joined York in the north. The Lancastrians could now safely seek their vengeance, and would make several unsuccessful attempts on the lives of Salisbury, York, and Warwick.;x

EVENTNAME164068;The Great Council at Leicester;x
EVENTHIST164068;Margaret of Anjou, Queen of England, was by now in full control of Henry VI's Council. She summoned a Great Council to Leicester. The Yorkist Lords were not invited. During the Council, it was agreed that the Queen would call a parliament to Coventry wherun she would present articles of indictement against York and his adjuvents for acts of treason. During the Council, however, the Queen refused to reveal the contents of the indictment. The Yorkists learned of the proceedings at Leicester, and so York, Salisbury, and Warwick hastily gathered their forces. There was little the Yorkists could do other than confront the King and his corrupt Council before parliament could take place. The alternative was attainder and thus forfeiture of their lives and livlihoods...;x

EVENTNAME164069;The Parliament of Devils;x
EVENTHIST164069;Queen Margaret completed her design of proscribing her enemies. A pliant parliament called to meet at Coventry found Richard Plantagenet Duke of York, Richard Neville Earl of Salisbury, and his son, Richard Earl of Warwick, and many of their followers guilty of treason. They were therfore sentenced to suffer the full effects of a bill of attainder. As such, their lands were to be forfeited and occupied by royal officers or distributed to loyal supporters. For the Yorkists, there was now no other option but to presuade King Henry VI to repeal the Act, or to cut down their Lancastrian rivals on the field of battle. There was only one obstacle between the Yorkists and King Henry, however, and that was the Duke of Somerset and his Lancastrian affinity. Henry shrewdly decreed that those who'd sided with the Yorkists and who would now lay down their arms would receive a full pardon, save those who were to be attainted. Thus there were many who refused to fight among the Yorkist ranks. Lacking numerical superiority from the onset, the prospects for a Yorkist victory on the battlefield looked grim. Heavily outnumbered, York, Salisbury and his son, Warwick abandoned their remaining retinues and fled England. Leaderless, their men simply surrendered to the Lancastrian army.;x

EVENTNAME164070;The Drogheda Parliament;x
EVENTHIST164070;When York summoned the Irish parliament to Drogheda his aim was to unite the Irish in their support for his claim to the throne of England. In order to accomplish this, York utilized his popularity and granted the Irish independence from the writs of the English Crown. Henceforth, English laws passed in Ireland would need to be accepted in an Irish Parliament. In return, York was recognized as the undisputed source of Royal authority, and it became treasonable act to attack the Duke of York in any way. Soon enough, the officer sent by Queen Margaret, who'd been charged with the responsibility of arresting York, found himself incarcirated, and then beheaded. In frustration, Margaret then named James Butler, Earl of Wiltshire, who was also Earl of Ormond, the King's new Lieutenant of Ireland. Ormond held states in Ireland and was charged with the task of harrying York and establishing the Royal authority in Ireland. Ormond's efforts were futile, however, and Irish hostility sent him home to England. York's position in Ireland was secured. He received homage and secured funding and men-at-arms from the Irish for use, no doubt, in England.;x

EVENTNAME164071;The Merchants of the Staple;x
EVENTHIST164071;The Merchants of the Staple were members of an English trading company that controlled the export of English raw wool. The staple was created in the thirteenth century, but moved from place to place according to the political needs of the times. In 1363, a group of English merchants located in France was incorporated as the 'Company of the Staple' possessing a complete monopoly of wool exports. With Warwick in control of England's possessions in France, he was able to secure a healthy donation from the company. He was a popular leader among the English troops in France and a series of successful raids against the merchant shipping of the Hanseatic League had enlarged both the caufers and reputation of Warwick and his men. With these new funds, Warwick prepared to launch another Yorkist assault on Lancastrian England.;x

EVENTNAME164072;The Duke of Buckingham is slain;x
EVENTHIST164072;The Earls of Warwick, Salisbury, and the Duke of York's son, Edward Earl of March landed in England with a force that took London without casualty. From London, Warwick and Edward moved north to meet the King's army under the command of the Duke of Buckingham. The two armies met on the field near Northampton. In the ensuing struggle, the Lancastrian force was obliterated and Buckingham was slain. Buckingham's death signalled a turn for the worse for the Lancastrians. As the King's appointed Commander, Buckingham had been Henry's Royal guardian. Thus, the battle of Mortimer's Cross ended with King Henry in the hands of the Yorkists. The victorious army marched back to London with the King where they would exert great influence over him. The Yorkist now held London and the King, but the Queen, the Duke of Somerset, and the Earl of Northumberland were still at large and could field an army in the north which embodied widespread roayalist sypathies. Thus, the Lancastrians would eventually respond with an army of English northerners and Scottish troops sent by the Queen and Regent of Scotland, Mary of Guise. York and Salisbury understood that the north would require subjugation, which itself could not be accomplished without the defeat of the key Lancastrian figures whom were leading the northen horde to retake London. York and Salisbury could not have imagined the size of the northern army they were about to confront.;x

EVENTNAME164073;The Act of Accord;x
EVENTHIST164073;With London and King Henry secured, York and his allies were now in control of the government, albeit a government which was in dissaray. While the Lancastrians reeled from the disaster at Northhampton, the Yorkists had done their best to quell resistance. When York entered London, he ordered that trumpets be played and his sword be held before him in the manner of King, as he marched to Westminster, where the lords of the land were assembled for his arrival. Entering Westminster Hall he walked up to the throne and placed his hand upon it, then turned to the assembled lords. Instead of the rapturous welcome he had expected, he was met with a stony silence that was eventually broken by the Archbishop of Canterbury, who approached him and asked if he would like to see the King. Without the support of the lords for his claim to be King, York, infuriated, set about the task of obtaining the throne by legal means. The Yorkists organized a full assembly of both houses, and seated the King before the full Parliament in royal regalia. The archbishop of York then narrated the alleged misdeeds of government from a text seemingly dependent on the Calais manifesto. Parliament then proceeded, amidst considerable confusion, to elect a speaker. The Commons was unwilling to agree to Henry's deposition. Originally, York had planned his coronation for the following day, but deffered to baronial council after a confrontation with Thomas Neville. Having submitted his claim to the throne, the lords, after a period of deliberation, agreed to accept York's claim, but to decline to give it any immediate effect. Henry was to have the Crown for his lifetime, afterwhich the Crown would fall to York and his heirs. Thus had passed what later came to be known as the Act of Accord.;x

EVENTNAME164074;Scottish Intervention;x
EVENTHIST164074;Queen Margaret left England sailing for Berwick intending to seek refuge in Scotland where James II, whose mother had been a Beaufort, was a friend to the Lancastrians. The Scottish Queen, Mary of Guelders sent an envoy to escort Margaret to Dumfries where she and her son were warmly received. Although James II had recently deceased, his son James III, then only a boy, was to govern with the aid of a Regency council. The widowed Queen and the Bishop of St. Andrews headed the Regency council and thus Lancastrian sympathy had remained strong. After a lengthy meeting at Lincluden, the two Queens came to an agreement. Scotland would loan Margaret money and men for Margarets campaign against the Yorkists. In return, Margaret agreed to surrender Berwick Castle, and promised an unguarded and rich southern England which the Scottish troops could plunder mercilessly. In response, thousands of Scottish men-at-arms volunteered for the campaign. Upon hearing word of Margaret's alliance with the Scottish Regent, Mary, Warwick utilized the opportunity to unleash a torrent of propaganda. It is possible that the Yorkists had somehow learned the substance of Margaret's alliance with the Scots. Margaret had promised Mary of Guelders Berwick castle and her Scottish soldiers the spoils of pillaging England's village and towns. Regardless, Warwick was quick to issue pamphlets and send heralds all over England with claims that the Queen was leading a massive army of Scotsmen bent on burning, pillaging and destroying all that lay in its path of fury. When the Queen re-entered England, the recklessness of her troops vallidated many of Warwick's warnings, and many villagers swarmed to the Yorkist cause with grave news. London would never forget the Queen's bargain with the Scots, and moreover, would actively assist the Yorkists with funding and troops...;x

EVENTHIST164075;Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York was cut down leading his heavily outnumbered reinforcements alongside his father-in law, Richard Neville, Earl of Salisbury, against a Lancastrian army led by Henry Beaufort, Duke of Somerset. The Lancastrians stripped him of his armour, befouled his body, and then beheaded him posthumously. In the rout, the notorious Lancastrian Lord Clifford had caught York's second son, Edmund, and killed him on the spot - stabbing him through the throat with a dagger. Warwick's father, Salisbury, was captured after the battle and executed the day after. Their heads were subsequently impaled on pikes and displayed in the city of York. A paper crown was placed mockingly on the deceased Duke's head. When York fell, his claim to the throne of England fell to his first born son, Edward of Rouen, Earl of March. Standing 6'4'', Edward cut an incredibly impressive figure. His soldiers, and indeed those of his father, were willing to lay down their lives for Edward and his claim. The future of the House of York now depended on the abilities of this gifted young warrior.;x

EVENTNAME164076;Disaster at St. Albans;x
EVENTHIST164076;Despite a technological superiority, the Earl of Warwick led a Yorkist army to defeat in St. Albans in a result which mirrored the first battle at St. Albans years before. Warwick himself barely esaped, but he had left King Henry under the keep of Lord Bonville and Lord Kyriell. Isolated and vastly outnumbered, Lord Bonville and Kyriell were forced to surrender Henry peacefully. Bonville and Kyriell had treated the Lancastrian King honourably. In return, the King had promised them mercy, but the Queen intervened and asked her 7 year old son, the younge Prince of Wales for judgement. He replied that the two Yorkists should be beheaded. Bonville was appalled and allegedly retorted 'May God destroy those who taught thee this manner of speech!' And with that the two Yorkists were executed on the spot. Without Henry, the Yorkists had little ground for authority. It was no longer possible for Edward to claim, as his father had done earlier, that he had taken up arms in order to remove from Henry the influence of evil councellors. The Commons now acknowledged that the endemic disorder was directly attributable to Henry's weak government. This time, the Yorkists' intentions were to remove him from power and make Edward King. In fact, they had no alternative, for despite Edward's warm welcome in London, he was not in a strong position being, technically, an attainted traitor who lacked funds and the support of the majority of England's magnates. With a parliament in session, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the bishops of Salisbury and Exeter, Warwick, Norfolk, and several other peers held a council at Baynard's Castle. It was unanimously agreed between those present that Edward should be offered the throne. On the following day, a deputation of lords and commons presented a petition to him, begging him to accept the crown and royal dignity of England. Edward acceded to the lords' petition and was shortly thereafterwards proclaimed King Edward IV at Beynard's Castle. However, Edward refused a formal coronation until the Lancastrians were put down in the north.;x

EVENTHIST164077;The coronations of England's Kings had always been splendid affairs, and Edward, with his sense of showmanship, was resolved that nothing should be missing to give the populace the spectacle that it expected. \n \nOn Sunday 28th June 1461, the solemn and splendid ceremony was conducted in Westminster Abbey, the cradle of the English Monarchy, by Thomas Bourchier, Archbishop of Canterbury, who now placed the crown on the first of the three Monarchs whom, in the course of his long life, he was to crown. The Archbishop of York, William Booth assisted him. \n \nAfterwards, there was the usual coronation banquet when Sir Thomas Dymoke, the hereditary King's champion, rode into the hall in full armour, flung down his mail gauntlet, and challenged anyone who disputed Edward's right to do battle with him. On Tuesday 30th June, he was due to attend a pageant before St Pauls Cathedral where a descending angel blessed him. It was a happy and joyful occasion on a fine summer's day. \n \nEdward now completed process of rewarding his faithful followers with titles, although in some cases they would have to wait until Parliament had completed the Attainder processes against the defeated Lancastrian Lords before they could receive grants of land to support their new dignities. His 12-year old brother George, newly returned from his refuge in Burgundy, was created Duke of Clarence. His 9-year old brother Richard, who had also come back from Burgundy, became Duke of Gloucester. Henry, Lord Bourchier, the Treasurer, was created Earl of Essex, and particularly bidden to keep a close eye on the Lancastrians of the Earl of Oxford's affinity in the eastern counties. William, Lord Fauconberge was rewarded for his outstanding loyalty to the House of York, and for his valour on the battlefield with the Earldom of Kent. Sir William Hastings, the knight who had been dubbed on the same battle-field, became Lord Hastings of Hastings in Sussex. Sir William Herbert received the first of his promotions as Lord Herbert.;x

This horrific sight turned him visibly grey with anger and sorrow, and he vowed that the Lancastrians would taste his vengeance and that those responsible for the deaths of his kinsfolk would be relentlessly sought out and slaughtered. Edward's first order in York was that the heads be taken down and decently interred at Pontefract with the corresponding bodies. He then issued commissions of the peace for the arrest of any Lancastrian rebels. The Yorkist King was greeted warmly in York and the leading citizens begged him for forgiveness. Edward, taking a conciliatory approach, forgave them freely. His hold on the realm was still tentative, and he needed the cooperation of his subjects and earned it with mercy. Within days, representatives from major towns across Yorkshire came and offered their submission to their new King. Edward's officers soon found several Lancastrian rebels hiding in the city, and rounded them up. Amongst them was the Earl of Devon who was mercilessly beheaded. Their heads replaced those of the Yorkists on Micklegate Bar, grim reminders of the fate of those who rebelled against their rightful sovereign.;x

During this time, the government had no authority in Northumberland.

Margaret had desired to visit Louis XI, and her expectations of him were high, especially after she learned that he had been actively involved in Oxford's conspiracy against Edward IV. The Queen and her son embarked for France. Landing in Brittany, the two were welcomed warmly by Duke Francis II. From there, she met with her father, and after a brief stay, caught Louis XI in Amboise. Margaret threw herself at Louis' feet, and begged him for assistance against the Yorkist. After a subsequent meeting, Margaret agreed to surrender their claims to Calais in return for French soldiers and 20,000 francs to assist her against Yorkist controlled England. The French soldiers were under the command of Pierre de Breze. The combined Lancastrian and French forces set sail and harried the English coast. Within weeks, the ships landed in Northumberland, although most had been scattered by a storm. Learning of Margaret's intentions, however, several Northumbrian castles rebelled, their garrisons declaring themselves for Henry VI.

EVENTHIST164081;No sooner had Edward secured the Northumbrian Castles than did the north rebel once more. Margaret had once again marched a combined Lancastrian and Scottish army into Northumberland. This time, Sir Ralph Percy, the untrustworthy captain of Bramburgh, allowed the Queen's mercenaries into the castle, enabling the Lancastrians to take it for Henry VI. Percy was also the captain of Dunstanburgh Castle, and as soon as the garrison saw the Queen approaching it also surrendered. Not long after, Sir Ralph Grey's treachery opened the gates of Alnwick Castle to the Lancastrians. Weeks later, the Lancastrians would be marching to Newcastle, and it seemed the north would need to be quelled once again...;x

EVENTNAME164082;Somerset is Executed;x
EVENTHIST164082;Henry Beaufort Duke of Somerset was the son of Edmund Beaufort Duke of Somerset who was slain during the first battle of St. Albans. Edward had been exceptionally patient and lenient towards Henry. In an attempt to win the notable Lancastrian to the Yorkist cause, Edward had pardoned Henry, restored to him his estates, and had even named Henry his Chamberlain, which gave Henry personal access to Edward. Nevertheless, Henry revolted for Queen Margaret under the Lancastrian banner in a last ditch attempt to overthrow the Yorkist regime. The Duke of Somerset had assembled the remnants of Lancastrian supporters primarily from the deceased Earl of Northumberlands estates. The Yorkist were the victors, their army led by John Neville, Lord Montague, and over thirty Lancastrian leaders, among them Somerset, were either killed on the field or executed after the battle. Among the spoils of the battle was King Henry's war chest. Within a short period of time, even the dethroned King himself was found and transported back to London. The battle marked the beginning of a quick end for the Lancastrian resistance in the north, as within weeks the remaining holdings were recovered. The brilliant and able commander John Neville saw to it that, one after another, Lancastrian heads rolled.;x

William, Lord Herbert had acted promptly to prevent him raising the countryside which had always been noted for its Lancastrian sympathies. Tudor was chased into the hills, brought to battle, and soundly defeated.

EVENTNAME164085;Warwick's Betrayal;x
EVENTHIST164085;Relations between Richard Earl of Warwick and King Edward IV had never been poorer. The dislike both men shared for each other had become painfully obvious to those who had taken even the slightest note. The earl had refused to attend Council meetings, obey Royal summons, and had even been suspected of dealings with the exiled Lancastrian Queen, Margaret. There had been several minor disturbances, and Warwick's agents had been implicated as participants. Nevertheless, Edward refused to believe that Richard of Warwick who had for so long fought for the House of York could possibly be conspiring against him. In reality, Warwick had sought a special dispensation from Pope Pius II to allow the marriage of Edward's brother, George, to Warwick's daughter, Isabelle. The Duke of Clarence and George Neville, Archbishop of York was summoned from London and rode hard for Dover to set sail to France. There, the Archbishop joined George and Isabel in Holy Matrimony. A second rebellion was incited by Robin of Redesdale, this time in the Midlands, where his forces were to be combined with Warwick's and Clarence's. The Earl of Devon and Earl of Pembroke had raised troops for King Edward, but on the eve of battle a quarrel between the two resulted in Devon abondoning Pembroke. In the ensuing struggle, Pembroke's army was defeated and he and his son were taken prisoner by Warwick and summarily beheaded along with Richard Woodville and his son John. Devon was eventually caught and executed as well. Warwick at the head of his army now advanced to sieze King Edward.;x
#;x
EVENTNAME164086;The King Remerges;x
EVENTHIST164086;Warwick had made a grave miscalculation during the weeks following his victory at Edgecote. Instead of persuing all of his enemies and rivals across the realm, his army had melted back to their humble origins. He now held the reigns of the government, but without the complacency of the King, Warwick's command was a dead letter. Thus, when a rebellion broke out yet again in the north led by Sir Humphrey Neville, a member of the branch of the family who had always sided with Lancaster, in order to restore Henry VI, Warwick realized that nobody in the realm was willing to fight for a noble who lacked a commission in the King's name. Thus, when Warwick asked Edward to sign the commission to raise the necessary troops, he failed to recognize that these troops would ultimately obey King Edward over the Earl. Warwick returned with the King's troops having supressed the rebellion, only to discover that Edward had announced that he was going to London. There was nothing the Earl could do. Edward would simply place him under arrest, or worse, if the Earl refused to allow Edward to leave. The nobles of the realm had disliked the Woodville's, and Warwick had done them a favour by executing their most prominent members, however, they weren't gong to support Warwick's big to place Clarence on the throne. And so Warwick and Clarence now found themselves isolated. The Earl and Duke reluctantly attended a Great Council, and were conditionally pardonded by the King.;x

EVENTNAME164087;Warwick and Clarence take flight;x
EVENTHIST164087;No ssoner had Warwick and Clarence been pardonded than they again plotted against Edward. Within months Warwick had stirred rebellion once more, this time in Lincolnshire. On this occasion, however, clarence had met with Edward in London in order to install a false sense of security in his brother. Warwick and Clarence requested commission to raise forces to quell the rebellion, and so Edward obliged. Nevertheless, Edward made his way with his army to meet with the rebels. The rebellion was quelled by Edward's troops without a fight. Among the possessions abandonded on the field were liveries belonging to Warwick and Clarence, and a chest full of correspondence between Warwick, Clarence, and the rebels themselves. Warwick and Clarence had betrayed Edward again. This time there would be no mercy, and the Earl and Duke knew it. The two fled, along with many of their supporters for France, where they would eventually seek aid from King Louis XI whom would orchestrate an alliance between the surviving exiled Lancastrians and the traitorous Yorkist magnates. In the meantime, Edward reasoned correctly that Warwick would try for Calais, and so he shrewdly sent orders to refuse Warwick's entry. Duke Charles of Burgundy assisted where he could, patrolling the seas for Warwick.;x
ACTIONNAME164087A;There is little else we can do...;x

EVENTNAME164088;Warwick's landing and Montagu's Betrayal;x
EVENTHIST164088;King Louis XI of France had orchestrated a reconsiliation and allaince between the disgruntled Yorkists and the exiled Lancastrians led by the unrelenting though aged Lancastrian Queen, Margaret, and her seventeen year old son, Edward. This paradoxical alliance was bent on restoring Henry VI to power. Priot to Warwick's landing, Henry, Baron Fitz-Hugh, at Warwick's urging, began a rebellion in the North. The Fitz-Hughes were known Lancastrians, and Henry had fought for Lancaster at the second battle of St Albans not too many years ago. King Edward decided to take his men north to stamp out the rebellion, and thus invite Warwick to land. The King planned to subsequently raise troops in the north at York and along his way south to meet Warwick on the field and destroy the traitorous magnate once and for all. Instead, once Edward supressed the rebellion, he found himself an exile at Duke Charles's court. The key difference was John Neville Marquess of Montagu, Richard Earl of Warwick's brother, who had lost the Earldom of Northumberland to Henry Percy. Despite Montagu's exemplary service to the House of York, even in the face of Warwick's rebellions, Edward found he could trust the Nevilles no longer and had deprived John of the Earldom not too many months before. Although Edward had seemingly compensated John for his loss with a promotion to Marquess and estates in Devonshire, John's new estates and offices paled in comparison to what he had enjoyed before in the north. And so the Marquess had decided to support Warwick's bid to reinstate Henry VI as King of England. Edward's men learned of John's plan, and compelled their King to flee abroad.;x
#;x
EVENTNAME164089;Elizabeth Woodville;x
EVENTHIST164089;Edward IV was by now the most eligable bachelor in Europe 'a man so vigorous and handsome that he might have been made for the pleasures of the flesh'. Many in his administration were anxious to find him a suitable bride. Edward, however, found one for himself, marrying Elizabeth Woodville, a woman of questionable birth. Although her mother had been Jacquetta of Luxembourg, her father had been a squire, and later promoted to Lord Rivers. Elizabeth was a widow of the late John Grey, a baron who'd died fighting for the Lancastrians. As such she was considered unsuitable both as a bride for Edward and as a Yorkist Queen. Thus the Nobles reacted with dismay when Edward announced his bride to the Council after having kept it secret for well over four months. Warwick, the most powerful magnate in England had been advocating a French bride for Edward in both the English and French courts, and now faced a serious blow to his political integrity. When Elizabeth came to court she brought with her five unmarried brothers, seven unmarried sisters, and two sons from her previous marriage. As members of the royal entourage, the Woodvilles would have to be elevated to a more respectable status than their background could justify. This meant land, titles and marriages into the English nobility. Warwick, among others, would take great personal insult to the influx of Woodvilles, and could do little as marriage prospects for his own two daughters and heirs dissapeared. Nevertheless there was another English candidate for Edward. Eleanor Talbot who, like Elizabeth, was a widowed Lancastrian, but unlike Elizabeth, was not saddled with a large family to promote in court. Moreover, the Bishop of Bath would later testify that Edward had in fact entered into a marriage contract with Eleanor, a legally binding promise which would render Edward's marriage to Elizabeth void on grounds of bigomy. Of course Edward could have bowed to Warwick's whim...;x

EVENTNAME164090;A Suitor for Duke Charles's Daughter;x
EVENTHIST164090;Following King Edward's success in the northernmost regions of his realm, the Yorkist regime seemed secure. The fledgling government could finally focus on external matters. Years of war and instability had ravaged England's economy. Particularly hurt was England's trade. Thus, mutual economic and political interests with the Duchy of Burgundy brought Duke Philippe to suggest to Edward that the Duke's granddaughter, Mary, should wed one of Edward's younger brothers. George, Duke of Clarence, was a rash and arrogant upstart and Edward was well aware of that fact. He was equally aware that Clarence was heir apparent to the throne. A union between his ambitious younger brother and one of Europe's mightiest states would only embolden Clarence and damage Edward's personal relations with Duke Charles in the long run. Furthermore, the Earl of Warwick favoured King Louis XI in France, and so he worked feverishly to promote an marriage alliance between the Yorkists and Valois dynasties. A marriage to Burgundy would severely jeopardize Warwick's standing within European diplomatic and political circles, because Edward had given Warwick the impression that he was interested in an Anglo-French alliance. Edward did not agree to Charles's proposal but would eventualy put forth a proposal of his own that did not involve either of his younger brothers. Alternatively, Edward could have put forward his youngest brother, Richard, who was at that point a youthful Duke of Gloucester.;x

EVENTNAME164091;Isabelle and Anne Neville;x
EVENTHIST164091;With each shameless Woodville promotion at court, Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick fumed as his influence over his cousin and King of England, Edward, slipped further into the distant past. His own enormous family, the Nevilles, owed its vast wealth and prestige to their shrewed and methodical marriages of their many heirs and heiresses for generations. Ironically, the Earl himself with his emense estates had no sons and only two daughters. With Warwick having reaped the spoils of the defeated Lancastrian nobility, his daughters were to inherit the greatest estates in all of England. Now, because of the social ambitions of the Queen's kindred, it looked as if there would be no one of suitable rank left for them to wed. Moreover, Edward had stubbornly refused to let Warwick have the most desirable matches of all, the King's own youthful brothers George, Duke of Clarence and Richard, Duke of Gloucester. Though Warwick had been York and Edward's strongest supporters, Edward feared mixing the potent ingredients that had derailed Richard II, and again Henry VI's regimes. Ambition and youthful Royals with vast estates had tendencies to create civil strife, weaken Kingdoms, and at the very worst, depose Kings. Afterall, Edward was the product of such a situation and was well aware of that fact. Furthermore, the King wished to release himself utterly of Warwick's arrogant and self-rightous direction. Thus, Edward wrote to the Pope requesting he abstain from granting Warwick or any of his brothers, a Papal Bull sanctioning their marriages to the heirs of Warwick, until Edward himself had agreed.;x

Calais and Gascogne were England's residual territories, and it was now time to surrender them peacefully to the French. King Henry VI, son of King Henry V, faced enormous pressure from both the merchant class, whom were vested in England's commercial interests in the lowlands and southwestern France, and the Yorkists, a faction of England's nobility whom had opposed Henry VI's government, to defy France. Nevertheless, Henry VI and his trusted ministers knew, like his father before him, that England could ill-afford a prolonged war with France.;x

EVENTHIST164097;Beguiled by Persian offers of trade privileges, reduced customs taxes and control of the trade entrepôt of Hormouz at the entrance to the Persian Gulf, the East India Company decided to aid the Persians in reducing the Portuguese fortresses on the islands of Qeshm and Hormouz. They contributed 9 warships to cut off the Portuguese from any relief by sea. They also landed some of their guns to batter down the walls of the fortresses. With their aid the Persians captured both fortresses, but refused to turn over Hormouz to them. The East India Company looted goods worth some £100,000 from Hormouz, but the ship was wrecked leaving the Gulf. To add insult to injury the Duke of Buckingham extorted a fine of £10,000 for himself and another £10,000 to the Crown for waging war without permission. However, that didn't stop John Company, as the EIC was commonly known, from continuing to attack the Portuguese wherever they could be found until 1635.

EVENTHIST164108;The Raid on the Medway, sometimes called the Battle of Medway or the Battle of Chatham, was a successful Dutch attack on the largest English naval ships, laid up in the dockyards of their main naval base Chatham, that took place in June 1667 during the Second Anglo-Dutch War. The Dutch, under nominal command of Lieutenant-Admiral Michiel de Ruyter, bombarded and captured Sheerness, went up the River Thames to Gravesend, then up the River Medway to Chatham, where they burnt three capital ships and ten lesser naval vessels and towed away the Unity and the Royal Charles, pride and normal flagship of the English fleet. It is generally considered the largest Dutch naval victory in history and the worst English naval defeat. The raid led to a quick end to the war and a favourable peace for the Dutch.;x

EVENTHIST164109;Sir, we have beaten back the Dutch navy with our fleet!;x
#;x
EVENTNAME164110;The line of battle;x
EVENTHIST164110;In naval warfare, line of battle is a tactic in which the ships of the fleet form a line, end-to-end. Its origins are traditionally ascribed to the navy of the Commonwealth of England, especially to General at Sea Robert Blake who wrote the Sailing and Fighting Instructions of 1653, but it was already used in the Action of 18 September 1639 by Dutch Lieutenant-Admiral Maarten Tromp. \n \nThe line of battle has the advantage over previous naval tactics  in which ships closed on each other for individual combat  that each ship in the line can fire its broadside without fear of hitting a friendly ship. Therefore in any given amount of time more shots can be fired by the entire fleet. Another advantage is that a relative movement of the line in relation to some part of the enemy fleet allows for a systematic concentration of fire on that part. To fend off this possibility the other fleet too can move in a line, with the result so typical for sea battle since 1675: two fleets sailing along each other or in opposite tack. A ship powerful enough to stand in the line of battle came to be known as a ''ship of the line'' (of battle) or a ''line of battle'' ship which shortened to become ''battleship''. The line is at its most effective when moving perpendicular to the axis of movement of the enemy fleet, e.g. by ''crossing the T'' or by breaking the enemy line and moving through it (e.g. Four Days Battle, Battle of Schooneveld, Battle of Trafalgar), by trying to cut off and isolate part of the enemy's line and concentrating a stronger force on it (e.g. Battle of Texel, Battle of the Saintes), or by trying to 'double up' the enemy's ships (e.g. Battle of Beachy Head). This way the enemy ships block each other's line of fire.;x

EVENTNAME164142;The Protectorate;x
EVENTHIST164142;After the dissolution of the Barebones Parliament, John Lambert put forward a new constitution known as the Instrument of Government, closely modelled on the Heads of Proposals. It made Cromwell Lord Protector for life, in order to undertake the chief magistracy and the administration of government. He had the power to call and dissolve parliaments but obliged under the Instrument to seek the majority vote of the Council of State. However, Cromwell's power was also buttressed by his continuing popularity among the army, which he had built up during the civil wars, and which he subsequently prudently guarded. Cromwell was sworn in as Lord Protector on 15 December 1653. The creation of the office of Lord Protector added an ominous - and to the Royalist faction, extremely useful - element of hypocrisy to the fledling republic, and seemed only to further weaken a series of parliaments already dominated by Cromwell. Conversely, the wielding of such immense power in the hands of by far the single most capable man in government meant that decisions were pushed through a lot quicker, and the nation - at home as well as abroad - had a single, iconic figurehead to swear allegiance to. Just like the Kings of old, Cromwell's image was emblazoned on all Commonwealth sterling. The only thing missing, was a crown...;x

EVENTNAME164143;The Coronation;x
EVENTHIST164143;In 1657, Cromwell was offered the crown by Parliament as part of a revised constitutional settlement, presenting him with a dilemma, since he had been instrumental in abolishing the Stuart monarchy. Cromwell agonised for six weeks over the offer. He was attracted by the prospect of stability it held out, but in a speech on 13 April 1657 he made clear that God's providence had spoken against the office of King: I would not seek to set up that which Providence hath destroyed and laid in the dust, and I would not build Jericho again. Instead, Cromwell was ceremonially re-installed as Lord Protector at Westminster Hall, sitting upon King Edward's Chair, which was specially moved from Westminster Abbey for the occasion. Notably, the office of Lord Protector was still not to become hereditary, though Cromwell was now able to nominate his own successor. Cromwell himself, however, was at pains to minimise his role, describing himself as a constable or watchman, not as a supreme head of state.;x

EVENTNAME164144;Lambert's Act of Union;x
EVENTHIST164144;Despite being one of the longest reigns in the history of the British Isles, Richard Cromwell's tenure as King wasn't a particuarly eventful one. From the death of his father, Oliver I, in 1658, Richard's life had been one of constant quarrel with, and estrangement from, the various parliaments which had ruled the nations over which he nominally presided. Like his father - a man whose ghost the indifferent King never could quite lay to rest - Richard had always been a republican at heart, so quite how he managed to rule over his ever-expanding territories as an annointed King for over fifty years was the source of much bafflement to everyone. After several largely insignificant and wholly unsuccessful landings by Charles Stuart and his ever-optimistic Scots entourage, Richard finally gave in to Parliament (a seemingly recurring theme) and signed Lambert's Act of Union, a series of documents and hearings legally and definitively uniting Richard's territories into a single Kingdom of Great Britain. The House of Commons in Westminster exercised supreme judicial and military power over every inch of the new Kingdom. With no elected assembley north of the border and no sizable military garrison to try and lure to their cause, the Stuart Pretender and his friends would have to try a little harder next time...;x
#;x
EVENTHIST164145;Despite siring several notable bastards, the death of the childless Queen Dorothy in 1676 coupled with Parliament's refusal to let Richard marry his mistress (on the grounds that she had previously been married to a Roman Catholic) meant that, effectively, the House of Cromwell would come to an end with the King's demise. Richard was outraged, condemning both the Commons and his role as a constitutional monarch. For years, the King had maintained that the only reason Parliament possessed the power it did was because of his father - and for years, his cries fell on deaf ears. Finally, in 1701, the ailing King made a stand, declaring the Act of Settlement, a piece of royal legislation handing the crown to the eldest surviving heir of Sophia, Electress of Hanover. In the beginning, Parliament was outraged, and issued a writ against the legislation, claiming it was illegal as it had not been through the Commons. A few months later, however, the King's beloved mistress caught Scarlet fever, dying almost immediately. Richard was thrown into prolonged bouts of melancholy, and in a rare of act of sympathy, Parliament finally accepted the Act of Settlement, knowing that realistically, the old and distraught King could never produce an heir.;x
#;x
EVENTHIST164146;On July 12th, 1712, Richard IV's eighty-five year-old body finally gave up on him. The ancient heir of Oliver Cromwell died, not at Whitehall or at Windsor, but in a chair by the fire in his father's old home in Huntingdon - the same room in which he was born. Over a decade earlier, Richard had signed the Act of Settlement, promising the crown to the Protestant successors of James I by way of Sophia, Electress of Hanover. Despite his natural distain for the English and their strange customs, George was a capable soldier and a gifted administrator, previously serving as both Field Marshal and Imperial Archtreasurer respectively. However long and complacent Richard IV's reign may have been, it did garner this unlikely success. By 1714, the Kingdom bequeathed to the House of Hanover was in virtual anarchy. Not only had it gone without a head of state for over two years, but the vast sums of money required to continue her participation in the War of Spanish Succession had resulted in Parliament declaring national bankruptcy twice since 1708. German or not, the arrival of Prince George in the summer of 1714 could not have come at a better moment.;x

EVENTHIST164155;Norfolk system can track its roots to the late Middle Ages when small farmers in Northern Anglia started to improve their agricultural methods using clover and turnip instead of traditional fallow-land. This method proved to be very successful as greatly fertilized soil with nitrogen and other nutrients. The system became very popular in the late 17th century when many landlords became interested in rational use of land and in the early 19th century most of England's land, now engrossed and enclosed by very few owners, used as the basis of their production. \n \nThough, a peasant method in it's origin, Norfolk contributed to the increase of agrarian capitalism, destroying this way many communities and creating cheap labour for early industrialized cities.;x

My lord, whilst putting these treacherous siblings to death may seem an obvious end to our problems, it could in fact lead to greater unrest amongst York's former supporters. On the other hand, forgiveness has been the byword of your reign: why not continue this generosity through a policy of repproachment with the heirs of York?

EVENTNAME164218;Henry VI's Minority;x
EVENTHIST164218;When King Henry V departed for his last campaign in France, he had appointed his youngest brother, Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, as Regent during his absence. Whilst Henry lived, the appointment was acceptable to all because Gloucester was firmly under the control of his eldest brother and could be called to order if the necessity arose. He was an intelligent man, and in the last months of King Henry V's reign, Gloucester discharged his office dutifully and conscientiously. He was a prominent heroe of Agincourt and had been severely wounded in that epic battle, which had ensured his immense popularity with the commons. Added to this he was affable, approachable, and a noted patron of letters and learning. He favoured war until the French were truly subjugated, a view commonly held by the people who felt that they deserved nothing less. Gloucester's troubles arose from his dealings with the magnates whose responsibilities enabled them to play a hand in England's government. They found him quarrelsome and difficult and so they disliked and distrusted him. Chief among those who held this view were the two remaining Beaufort brothers, Henry, Bishop of Winchester, and Thomas, Duke of Exeter, the infant King's guardian. Henry V had done what he could before his death to arrange for his son's rule. In his will, Henry V had designated Henry's brother John, Duke of Bedford, to prosecute war in France, while England was to be ruled by Gloucester. However, there was no constitutional precedent, and while Gloucester viewed his brother's dying wishes as his right, in actuality, it was the Lords of the Council who were to determine Gloucester's place in government. Led by Henry Beaufort, the Council resisted Gloucester's wishes and refused to invest a Regency in him. Instead, Gloucester was created 'Protector of the Realm of England' and King's Chief Councillor, sinking to the role of Second Councillor whenever his older brother, John, was present in England. So, the council secured their rule despite Henry V's wishes and Gloucester's actions. Nevertheless, Parliament could reverse this development and met late in the year. Gloucester then pressed his cause before the Lords to be recognised as Regent of England, basing his claim on his blood relationship to the new King, and the dying wishes of his brother. The Lords, suitably prepared by the two Beaufort brothers and other members of the Council, flatly refused Gloucester's request. Thus, parliament backed the Council's wishes and his reduced position was confirmed. Gloucester was deeply insulted by Beaufort's efforts, and would never truly forgive him. Meanwhile the nominal rule of a baby invited discord and frustrated war efforts. Sacrifice and unity were demanded at home, yet they depended heavily on the success of the war...;x

EVENTNAME164220;Jacqueline of Hainault;x
EVENTHIST164220;William, Count of Holland and Hainault died in 1417, leaving one daughter, Jacqueline. Jacqueline had been married to the late Dauphin of France, who had died only a few weeks before her father. At the time, King Henry V had made overtures for the lady's hand for his brother John, Duke of Bedford, but her mother, the sister of the late Duke of Burgundy, John 'the Fearless', saw to it that the young widow married John, Duke of Brabant. John was Philip's nephew and his father had been killed by the English at Agincourt. The marriage may well have been void on the grounds of consanguinity, because John and Jacqueline were cousins, but its political justification lay in keeping Hainault within Burgundy's control. John 'the Fearless', and his son and successor, Philip 'the Good', had understood this all too well. Jacqueline had been passed over for the succession to the counties on her father's death in 1417 in favor of her uncle, John of Bavaria. However, the Duke of Brabant had simply ceded much of Jacqueline's inheritance to the Duke of Bavaria in order to settle the dispute. A diplomatic move that had not been received well by Jacqueline. Furious over her dull husband's inability to secure the inheritance, Jacqueline had left him. In 1421, she fled to London, where she met Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester. Within two years, they announced their intention of getting married. The two needed a Papal dispensation for the marriage, which Pope Martin V would not supply. Thus, Gloucester approached the recently displaced Pope Benedict XIII, who was happy to spite Pope Martin by granting the annulment. Their marriage entitled Gloucester to the counties of Holland, Zeeland and Hainult, albeit at a cost. The Courts of Europe were scandalised by what they had done. Philip was incandescent with rage and made it clear that he had suffered a grave affront which he felt most deeply. Believing, with good reason, that Jacqueline's inheritance of Hainault would never be surrendered to her peacefully, Gloucester saw seizure by force as the only alternative. The Council was finding it difficult to keep Gloucester in order, and it may well be that his enterprise was aimed at defying the wishes of the Council which had spurned him under the leadership of Bishop Beaufort. Nevertheless, they warned him that any such a venture into Hainault would be seen as a hostile act against Burgundy herself.;x

Gloucester was well aware of the consequences of associating England with a family feud well within Burgundian jurisdiction. A marriage between Gloucester and Jacqueline would entitle him to the Counties of Holland, Zeeland and Hainault. Gloucester would require a special Papal dispensation, which the current Pope, Martin V, would likely decline to provide. However, a dispensation from the displaced Pope Benedict XIII was well within reach. If Gloucester were to act on impulse, Burgundy would be incandescent with rage and the Courts of Europe would scandalised by what had occurred.

EVENTNAME164227;Beaufort and Gloucester Feud;x
EVENTHIST164227;By the end of 1425, Gloucester was stirring up more trouble in England. Although he was the titular Protector of the Realm of England, and the King's Chief Councilor, the Council, led by his uncle, Henry Beaufort, quarreled with him daily over domestic and foreign policy. Beaufort, bishop of Winchester, had been offered a Cardinal's hat during Henry V's reign, though the King had refused to allow Beaufort to accept, requiring the Bishop's services during those critical years. He was in high favour during Henry V's and Henry IV's reigns, serving as Chancellor on more than one occasion. Gloucester remained a staunch supporter of the war in France, but more importantly, had harboured ill feelings towards his uncle for excluding him from assuming control of King Henry VI's Regency after Henry V's death. Although Beaufort held a majority of support among the councillors in England, Gloucester's popularity in the Commons tended to balance the two court parties. In several instanes, the two had come to bitter words, heated exchanges and blows. On this occasion, however, Beaufort felt his life was in danger. Gloucester had already incited several mobs protesting Beaufort's actions, and was now threatening to forecfully remove Beaufort himself. The bishop frantically wrote to the Duke of Bedford, begging him to return to the Council in order to straighten out the valiant Duke's irate younger brother. Thus Bedford was obliged to return to England, in order to soothe the two parties. He remained there, personally administrating England until the two parties had been somewhat reconsiled the situation had stabilized, temporarily abandoning his personal war efforts in France.;x

EVENTNAME164228;Bedford's Death;x
EVENTHIST164228;On September 14th, 1435, John of Lancaster Duke of Bedford and Regent of France, younger brother of the great Henry V, drew his last breath. The loss of such an able commander and administrator was a severe blow to England's grip on France. Within weeks of Bedford's departure, areas of English occupied France revolted in a desperate attempt to shake off the English, whose presence in France had begun to seem like occupation. Compounding England's problems were severe grain shortages accross much of France. The English were forced to respond to the shortages by banning the export of grain in order to secure enough food for the soldiers. Bedford's death also signaled the gradual but steady demise of the King's Council and domestic stability, as constant jockeying for Royal favour within the factionalized English Court eclipsed issues of great importance and necessity. Without his older brother Bedford to keep him somewhat pacified, Gloucester, now heir presumptive, unleashed himself on Cardinal Beaufort. Their rivalry and continued squabling represented a source of constant conflict that spilled over into foreign and domestic matters. The events of the autumn of 1435 prompted the boy King, Henry VI, now nearing fourteen years of age, to voice his own views and take a greater interest in the emotionally charged political circumstances of the day. One thing was certain, England was simply ill equipped for, and slow to adapt to Bedford's departure.;x

EVENTHIST164229;The Duke of York was the son of Richard Earl of Cambridge and Anne Mortimer who had perished within days of York's birth. Richard had inherited his title from his paternal grandfather Edmund of Langely, the fourth surviving son of the great Edward III. Cambridge had been executed for treason by King Henry V on the eve of Henry's initial expedition to France in 1415, leaving York an orphan at the age of four. York's paternal uncle Edward, then Duke of York, was killed at Agincourt shortly thereafter, leading the English vanguard against the French cavalry in the opening phases of that epic battle. Perhaps it was Edward's loyalty and courageous actions at Agincourt that saved his nephew from an early political demise, but certainly by enfeofing his estates to trusted lords and supporters, Edward had helped to secure his young nephew's eventual recovery of the lands of York. Through his mother Anne, York would eventually inherit the vast Mortimer estates. Moreover, Anne descended directly from Lionel of Antwerp, the second surviving son of Edward III. Thus, York had an excellent claim on the throne of England, an arguably better claim than Henry's and the wealth to back such a claim if need be, as York was the richest and greatest magnate in England. Despite the questionable actions of his ancestors and his quiet claim, he had served as Henry VI's constable and had further proved himself a loyal subject of Henry's. In the months following Bedford's death, Gloucester's Court faction grew increasingly critical of Cardinal Beaufort's dominance over Henry VI. In the meantime, greater problems had emerged in France. The Council eventually decided York was the best candidate for Bedford's replacement. However, the length of York's term was indefinate, as the King would come of age soon enough and would be expected to make his own appointments. York was charged with the difficult task of providing good governance to lands wrought with strife and seathing with unrest. In this task he was largely successful, surrounded as he was by experienced administrators such as Louis of Luxemburg and seasoned soldiers like Lord Talbot...;x

With this declaration the Council reverted to its traditional role of advising the King. The power of the Councillors had increased immensely with 15 years of autonomy, however no one would challenge Henry VI's right to rule in his own name. Once he established himself, Henry VI reappointed all of the Councillors to their former positions, provided they swore not to settle significant matters of state without consulting the King first. A stoutly devout man, Henry VI would prove himself ill-equipped for Kingship, incapable of employing the necessarily ruthless political measures required of the late medieval King.

EVENTNAME164232;The Beauchamp Earl of Warwick is no more;x
EVENTHIST164232;Having proved himself a great warrior fighting against the Welsh Prince Owen Glendower during the first few turbulent years of Henry IV's reign, Warwick had left his country to make a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, later travelling throughout much of eastern Europe before returning to England. He had served in the retinue of the future King Henry V, and again during Henry's great campaigns in France. After Henry V's death, the council had charged Warwick with the task of educating the infant King Henry VI. With the Duke of York requesting to be relieved of duty in the late spring of 1437, Henry VI had appointed Warwick to York's position in France. Warwick remained in France for the final two years of his life. Though a brilliant leader, Warwick was well past his prime at the time of his death. Nevertheless, his death precipitated another crisis throughout a countryside which required strong and permanent leadership for stability. Henry VI and his council would have to look towards a more vigorous candidate for a position many of those in the Council coveted for themselves...;x

EVENTNAME164233;The Duke of York Returns to France;x
EVENTHIST164233;Frustrated with a lack of proper funding and the constant sense of bickering and deadlock within the King's Council, Richard, Duke of York had requested he be relieved of duty in France late in the Spring of 1437. York had been replaced with Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, a brilliant military commander though already an aged man. It could hardly have been unexpected when, less than two years later, Warwick passed away. His successor had to be sensitive to the conflicting political views held by Gloucester and Cardinal Beaufort's faction in the King's Council. Furthermore, the new lieutenant needed to be of sufficient social status, and of the modest number of possible candidates York was the most promising. The Duke of Gloucester was anxious to secure the post, but the Beauforts and their aspiring affinity successfully resisted his efforts. York had experience, landed resources from which to raise fresh troops, and had shown himself willing to listen to advice. Thus he was once more driven into England's entanglements in France, and named Lieutenant-General of France. The terms of his appointment were similar to his predecessors. He was given the authority to make personal appointments to all offices, including those of constable and chancellor, and to all benefices in France. He could dispose of all lands which might come to the Crown either for life or in tail male, and reserved the right to appoint captains to castles where absentee custodians had failed to make provision. He was granted control over French revenues. During his first term, York had been quick to earn the loyalty and respect of many of Bedford's former supporters in France, and used this appointment to consolidate his power. During his five year term he would manage to stabilize the countryside, despite the decision to reduce the French presence in his large council from a majority to a minority of just two. The mood was such that the French could no longer be trusted. Order would have to be restored from the top down. On the other hand, the move was symptomatic of a pressing issue...the English presence in France was not being viewed as one of liberation or rightful rulership, but of brutal occupation. There were, however, alterior motives behind the appointment as members of the Cardinal's Court faction spread inflated fears that Gloucester and York had allied against the King. With York in France, Gloucester could be isolated and neutralized, and events could soon transpire to tip the balance of Royal sway further in the Beauforts' favour.;x

EVENTNAME164234;Eleanor Cobham's Witchcraft;x
EVENTHIST164234;The trial of Eleanor Cobham, Humphrey Duke of Gloucester's wife, was primarily the result of Henry VI's suspicion and fear of his uncle. Gloucester, though aged, was an overbearing presence at Court, and as the heir apparent, his opinions could scarcely have been ignored by either the King or his Councillors. Yet through his constant attacks on the Cardinal Beaufort and his nephews, Gloucester had shown himself to be a political enemy of those whom Henry, more often than not, was looking to for support of his aims. To the Beaufort family, the thought of Gloucester succeeding Henry VI was not an alluring one. By 1441, it had been resolved that Gloucester must be eliminated or at the very least curtailed. Thus it came to be that Eleanor Cobham was accused of sorcery. Astrology was practised by many to forecast what the future may hold, but it was still looked upon with mixed feelings, and any practice of the art had to be very discreet. Roger Bolingbloke, a priest who had some connection with Gloucester and Eleanor, was arrested together with other priests on the grounds that they had cast Eleanor's horoscope to forecast whether she would ever become Queen of England. Whether or not this was ever done is not clear. Bolingbloke subsequently found himself placed on a stage, clad in a fantastic garb and surrounded with the tools of his alleged craft. The Bishops of London, Salisbury and Rochester gave a blistering sermon bidding him to turn his back on all sorts of sorcery. Eleanor promptly fled into sanctuary at Westminster Abbey, which was viewed to signify a guilty conscience. The Abbey gave no sanctuary where sorcery was concerned, and she was subsequently brought before an Ecclesiastical Court. The Church had already used torture to extract the evidence it wanted against her from Bolingbloke and the other priests. Eleanor now found herself facing multiple charges, among them treason, heresy and witchcraft, and was committed to confinement to await further examination. The Beauforts now felt it wise to involve others, particularly the temporal Lords. King Henry VI could be prevailed upon to issue a commission charging several prominent members of the Council to examine the matter further. Accordingly John Holland, Earl of Huntingdon, Humphrey Stafford, Earl of Stafford, William de La Pole, Earl of Suffolk, Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland, Ralph, Lord Cromwell, John, Lord Fanhope and Robert, Lord Hungerford were charged with the investigative task...;x

EVENTNAME164235;Eleanor Cobham's Trial;x
EVENTHIST164235;The commission established by Henry VI uncovered a woman known as 'the Witch of Eye'. She had been accused of witchcraft before, but had been released for lack of evidence. She now sold cosmetics, and Eleanor was one of her customers. Eleanor soon found herself with further charges, one of which was that she was an accessory to the treasons alleged against the priest Bolingbloke. Eleanor was further examined by the Bishops of London, Lincoln and Norwich. The examination resulted in further charges alleging an attempt to bring about Henry VI's death by magic. She was said to have made a waxen doll of the King, and to have stuck pins into it designed to produce excruciating pains in the same part of the King's person. She was then supposed to have placed the doll before a hot fire. Its slow melting would have caused the King to die slowly, in excruciating agony. Eleanor, who was prepared to admit that she had bought cosmetics from the Witch, vehemently denied all the other charges against her. The Bishops' task was made no easier by the fact that the King was undoubtedly still alive and in the best of health. Neverthless, the Bishops could rely on the confessions of her co-accused which had been extracted through torture. She was found guilty of all the charges alleged against her and had every expectation of joining the Witch and Bolingbloke at the stake. Despite the grim fate of her accomplices, Henry VI forbade the taking of Eleanor's life. She had served ther purpose, as Gloucester's wife was now associated with witchcraft, a heinous offence. Eleanor was forced to perform a public penance. It was enough that she was to be confined for the rest of her life, first in Chester castle and later in Kenilworth. Henry VI saw to it that she had an ample allowance so that she could live in some degree of comfort. Gloucester was not what he'd once been. He had regarded himself as untouchable, standing as he did so close to the Throne. Now it had been made very clear, and very apparent, that his enemies had found a way to harm him in a manner which he could not easily have foreseen or forestalled. In place of the old recklessness, he now had to be extremely careful, and this was not something that came easily to his nature. The Beauforts had seen to it that he was crushed as a political force. Gloucester was still as popular as ever with the populace, but at Court, men began to drift away from him as the Beauforts were clearly ascendant at Court. King Henry VI may have been pliable, and he still had a great deal of regard for his old uncle. However, if Gloucester filled the King's ear with tales discreditable to the Beauforts, it was only necessary to remind the King that Gloucester's consort had been condemned for sorcery.;x

EVENTNAME164236;The Lieutenancy of France;x
EVENTHIST164236;York had received a summons to Parliament. His presence was necessitated by Henry VI's determination for a lasting peace with France. Henry's determination to press ahead with his policy placed York in considerable political difficulty. The policy was unpopular and was actively resisted in France and to some extent in Henry's Council as well. York's own council in France was uncooperative, and his councillors in England were highly critical. While York had been in France, Adam Moleyns, keeper of the Privy Seal and a staunch ally of Edmund Beafourt Marquess of Somerset, had accused York of corruption and general mismanagement to the detriment of England's positions in France. Not long before this York had received the backing of Parliament and public recognition for his services. Nevertheless, charges of mismanagement were obviously unwelcome from any source, and it was especially disconcerting that they had been pressed by a royal councillor so close to Somerset, Suffolk, and the King. Adding to this was York's hostility towards the conciliatory measures Henry was prepared to make in order to secure his peace with France. Thus, when York sought due payment from the exchequer for his services, he found his inquiries deflected. Despite York's understanding that his summons to England was merely a temporary engagement, Henry refused to reappoint him to the command in France. York's inquiries were brushed off with casual assurances that he had not incurred any Royal displeasure. In reality, Henry and his closest councillors, particularly the Beauforts, had begun to view York with as much distrust and suspicion as they did Gloucester. Subsequently, York, the greatest and mightiest of England's nobles was to be patronized, isolated, and circumscribed. It was the beginning of a series of preemptive measures taken to eliminate a potential source of obstruction to Henry's Royal prerogative.;x

York's own council in France was uncooperative, and his councillors in England were highly critical. In the meantime, Adam Moleyns, keeper of the privy seal, had accused York of favouritism in the payment of some soldiers, non-payment of others, and general mismanagement to the detriment of England's possessions in France. York would retort with charges of his own against Moleyns. Despite the public recognition York had received for his services in an act of Parliament, charges of mismanagement were obviously unwelcome from any source, and it was especially disconcerting that they had been pressed by a royal councillor so close to Suffolk and therefore, to the King. When York sought due payment from the exchequer for his services he found his inquiries deflected, and within the year, his position was given to Edmund Beaufort Earl of Somerset. Given recent Beaufort enterprises into France, the appointment could scarcely generate much confidence within York's council in France. Many assumed that Somerset had been appointed to further a peace policy. Compounding York's problem was the fact that he had taken part in council discussions in England regarding the prospect of surrendering certain English holdings in France, to which he had demonstrated an outright hostility. York was not prepared to support any such conciliatory concession to France. He was equally as unimpressed with several favourable financial settlements confirmed by Henry upon the Beauforts, especially when York's own financial capabilities were being stifled by the lack of payments owed to him. Alternatively, Henry VI could have rewarded York with the Duchy of Normandy. York was after all, England's premier Duke, and he had sacrificed much for Henry's realm. Moreover, slighting York may not be the most wisest of actions in the long run. Of course any act alienating prized Crown possessions of England to those outside of the King's closest advisors would have be met with resistance from Beaufort's and Suffolk's affinity. But then again, these men coveted such lucrative positions for themselves...;x

EVENTHIST164238;William de La Pole, Marquis of Suffolk and his allies, the Beauforts, were now the rising power in England. They regarded Gloucester, still heir presumptive to the Throne, as an enemy because he opposed their regime. Suffolk and his adjuvents could count on Queen Margaret, who regarded Suffolk and the Beauforts as supporters, and shared their dislike and distrust for Gloucester. Queen Margaret had little difficulty in persuading the King that Gloucester should be impeached, and Suffolk prepared Articles of Impeachment for Parliament to consider. Writs were issued bidding Parliament to meet at Cambridge for the primary purpose of considering the Articles of Impeachment. It was clear to Suffolk, however, that Gloucester's demise was necessary. A rumour quickly circulated that Gloucester was about to rise in revolt. In this respect, Gloucester played into his enemies hands by raising a small retinue of horsemen. On his way to Parliament, he was arrested without warning. However, Gloucester's immense popularity with the Commons, and Henry's knack for forgiving his subjects, gave Gloucester a good chance of simply enduring a light reprimand. Suffolk understood this all-too well...Gloucester died in confinement within days of his arrest. Meanwhile, Parliament had been moved to an region where Suffolk's supporters were most prominent. And so a Parliament packed with members from Suffolk's own estates had Gloucester attainted. Gloucester's heirs were executed and his lineage was no more.

EVENTHIST164244;Dudley was among the sixteen members of the Regency Council King Henry had appointed to govern the kingdom during Edward's minority. The new King's uncle, Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset, was elected Lord Protector just before the coronation. That year Dudley sought and was duly granted the right to bear the arms of the Earls of Warwick, with the distinctive badge of the Bear and the Ragged Staff. By the end of 1549 most councillors, including Thomas Cranmer, the Earl of Arundel, William Paulet, and William Cecil, were turned against Somerset and united behind Dudley, the man with the ambition, will and determination to oust the Protector. Dudley lead the palace rebellion against Somerset in 1549, leading to Somerset's imprisonment and eventual execution in 1552. Unlike Somerset, whom he had outmanoeuvred, Dudley did not take the title of Lord Protector, and encouraged Edward VI to proclaim his majority. Nonetheless, Dudley effectively ruled the country by holding the two offices of Lord President of the Council and of Great Steward of the King's Household. Dudley was given the title of Duke of Northumberland in 1551. Dudley obtained such an influence over Edward that the King was ready to make it appear that Dudley's ideas were actually his own. Whether or not it was justified, Dudley acquired a bad reputation, becoming known as a 'tyrant', sometimes referred to as the merciless 'Bear of Warwick'. Despite the differing opinion of his character, some argue in Dudley's favour that he consulted the Privy Council regularly, did not make any executive decisions, and did not use the title 'Lord Protector' that Somerset had done. Dudley also began the political education of the young Edward VI.;x

EVENTHIST164247;After the unforeseen débâcle that was the Readeption (1470) and the subsequent 'mopping up' of what remained of the Lancastrian nobility, Edward IV's kingdom was both a stable and a prosperous one. By the middle of the decade, the restless and still relatively youthful King decided to call Parliament in order to raise taxes to fund his next project: the resumption of hostilities with France. The prospect of a war with the Valois was always a sure means of making Parliament open their purses, and by late June the Yorkist nobility had amassed the largest army sent to France until the First World War: 1,500 men at arms, 15,000 archers and countless horse, cannon and auxiliaries slogged their way through the Flanders mud. At the head of the Royal Army were Edward, Gloucester and Lord Hastings. The plan was for Edward to rendezvous with his brother-in-law, the duke of Burgundy, and their combined forces would call King Louis' army to battle and a second Agincourt would be won by the end of the campaigning season. With the cream of the French nobility once again dead or captured, France would be ripe for dismemberment. Though Edward still pressed his claim to Louis' throne, he had neither the patience nor the resources to undertake the sort of exhausting campaigns of conquest which had destroyed Henry Vs health. Thus, Edward narrowed his demands to the duchy of Normandy in full sovereignty and what in effect amounted to the entire French treasury.;x

EVENTNAME164248;Treaty of Picquigny;x
EVENTHIST164248;After it became clear to both Edward and Louis that Duke Charles had no intention of supporting his brother-in-law's venture, both kings agreed to a truce, to be signed on a bridge in the small town of Picquigny. Louis was a shrewd man and realised that one of Edward's primary motives for invading his realm was pressure from the ever-warlike Yorkist nobility. They wanted the same slice of fame, glory and riches that their fathers and grandfathers had enjoyed under Edward III and Henry V - Louis knew full-well that Edward had no intention of conquering his kingdom town-by-town, and so a compromise was reached: Louis would pay Edward 75,000 crowns in return for him leading his army back across the Channel. In addition, Louis would guarantee a payment of 50,000 crowns per year to the City of London for so long as both of them lived. Finally, Louis promised Edward's eldest daughter Elizabeth the young dauphin's hand in marriage, once the royal couple had come of age. For the people of England, Picquigny seemed a surprisingly inglorious step by King Edward, a man they had hitherto associated with persistence, courage and conquest. For their King, however, the treaty represented something altogether more important: financial and political independence from Parliament for the remainder of his reign. Edward was well aware of the lukewarm reception he would receive back in England, but as far as he was concerned he'd taken the biggest gamble of his reign - and pulled it off. Picquigny was important for several reasons: it was an official document signed by the kings of both England and France which in effect put an end to the Hundred Years' War once and for all. Moreover, it showed for the first time since 1066 that England was a lesser power than France, and in particular that she stood little chance of victory when acting independently of Burgundy and/or Brittany - both of whom had abandoned England when she needed them most. Finally, the economic implications of the treaty allowed for the much-needed resurgence of English trade with the Continent, and the Crown was now richer than it had been since the days of Henry II. Inglorious though it was, Picquigny helped substantially to recalibrate the English mindset - before it had witnessed civil war, chronic instability and a series of ruinous conflicts with France - afterwards, the Tudors' blend of strong, popular monarchy coupled with an ever-expanding Royal Navy and a flourishing network of maritime trade: the seeds of the first British Empire had been sown.;x

#;x
EVENTHIST164249;The treaty signed by two kings on a bridge in northern France in the long, wet summer of 1475 was a long time in the making. In the years since 1453, England had traded the weak and docile House of Lancaster for a much more popular and powerful alternative, the ravenous and warlike House of York. Edward IV's string of crushing victories over King Louis' reluctant and demoralised army over the previous months had broken French morale as at no time since 1415, and once again a king of France faced the humiliation of knowing that several of his most powerful dukes lay rotting in English gaols. By late August, Louis' position was not an envious one - the dukes of Burgundy and Brittany remained staunchly in Edward's camp, whilst the Emperor had made plain his refusal to intervene unless the King of England wished also to make himself King of France. Edward, thinking it best to quit while he was ahead, decided against testing the Emperor's resolve (besides, he knew that any form of Imperial intervention would risk losing him Burgundy's support, whose duke wished an Imperial crown for himself), instead demanding his original, far more modest war aims: the duchy of Normandy in full sovereignty as well as a massive war indemnity to be imposed on Louis' kingdom. Thus, what started out as a somewhat risky enterprise from which Edward expected to gain very little had stunned both sides beyond belief: Normandy had been returned to the English crown, Edward was now entirely non-reliant on Parliament for the remainder of his reign, and any still-lingering doubts over the usurpation of King Henry and the 'legitimate' Lancastrian dynasty had been quashed once and for all. To the people of England, God had vindicated Edward's right to reign by returning Normandy to its rightful sovereign. To Edward the way ahead was simple: he must finish what God Himself had started.;x

EVENTNAME164250;The Spider and The Boar;x
EVENTHIST164250;From what Edward IV knew of his opposite number in Paris, Louis XI of France was a meek, shrewd and Machievelian prince - l'universelle aragne, or the 'Spider King' - a man who would rather sell his own liver than face the prospect of renewed war with England, the kingdom whose policy of total war had all but destroyed his father's health and only served to further exacerbate the decades-old feudal infighting in France. What a surprise to Edward then, when only days after his letter to Louis reiterating his claim to the throne of France, he received a reply informing him that their two kingdoms were now at war, and as Edward and his court mused idly in London, Louis' army marched on Calais. Realising the letter was indeed signed by Louis' own hand, Edward despatched his brother Gloucester at the head of a thousand men-at-arms to reinforce the garrison at Calais. As far as Edward was concerned, the people of England would know nothing of his original letter, and therefore Louis had declared war on them without reason or provocation. Thus, with his brother the 'White Boar' headed for France, Edward called Parliament in order to fund his latest war - which they did both quickly and generously, for they believed King Louis the aggressor. For once, Edward believed he may well have finally outwitted the Spider, but until then he had to put his faith in the Boar.;x

EVENTHIST164251;Edward IV's resumption of hostilities with France in the summer of 1475 relied on a number of factors, chief among them the active support of his brother-in-law and close ally, Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy. Naïve to the last, if there was one man Edward thought he could count on it was Charles, and when the duke finally did rendezvous with Edward he brought with him but a ragged bunch of retainers and a chest of stolen Angevin gold with which to talk him into going back home. To Charles, Edward could not have asked for his help at a worse moment - his patchwork domain was under siege from all sides, including by an army led by the Emperor. In short, Charles couldn't spare a single man or horse, and the only reason he even bothered to meet up with Edward anyway was because his wife had begged him to for fear of losing favour with her brother. Nonetheless, Edward and Charles exchanged pleasantries as the English looked on in horror and dismay at what they had been promised to be a huge Burgundian army followed by the largest artillery train in Christendom. As it was, the brothers-in-law parted ways - Charles returned to Flanders to beg the local rulers for more gold in order to fund his war with the Swiss, whilst Edward realised his much-vaunted 'Great Enterprise' was already at an end and came to terms with Louis at Picquigny. To Edward, Charles' inability to support him and his subsequent embarrassment at the hands of the French amounted to nothing less than outright betrayal. From that moment onwards, Edward had washed his hands of the unreliable and self-serving Charles. Though a bitter blow in 1475, the Duke's death under the walls of Nancy less than two years later gave Edward the chance for revenge he had so longed for: he refused to come to the aid of Charles' daughter & heir, Duchess Mary, and as a result the Burgundian state was destroyed - forever split between the Valois and Habsburgs.;x

But the reconciliation between Venice and the Pope did not stop the French to continue the war against Venice with attacks to her cities in Terraferma. Julius II, in the meanwhile, had become increasingly concerned by the growing French presence in Italy and formulated plans, both to chase the French out of the Po Valley and to seize the Duchy of Ferrara, a French ally, with the intention to add the territories of Modena, Reggio and Ferrara to the Papal States. In realizing his plan the Pope immediately excommunicated Alfonso d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, declaring his fief forfeited for his remaining loyal to France, then he gained the military support of Venice, eager to recover her territories lost to the French a armies and hired an army of Swiss mercenaries to attack Milan as to isolate the French armies in Italy. However his plans failed as the French army managed to invade Romagna and occupy the cities of Bologna and Ravenna, supported by the powerful and celebrated artillery of Duke Alfonso d'Este. In addition, in response to Pope's switching sides, Louis XII of France convoked a Schismatic Council at Pisa as to have the 'Warrior Pope' deposed. Pope Julius II, having unsuccessfully pressed the Republic of Florence to refuse hosting the schismatic cardinals, proclaimed the Holy League against France and convoked a Council of his own to meet at the Lateran in Rome. The promise of territorial gains at French expense caused Ferdinand II of Aragon and Emperor Maximilian I to abandon their alliance with the French, and in October 1511, they joined the newly-formed Holy League together with Julius II and the Republic of Venice. In November, following the Swiss declaration of war on France, Edward V threw his lot in with the Valois, hoping to repair his kingdom's tattered relations with his powerful southern neighbour whilst determined to thwart Imperial ambitions in Italy and re-establish Plantagenet influence in Paris.;x

EVENTNAME164254;Battle of Sedgemoor;x
EVENTHIST164254;When the Catholic James II succeeded to the throne in February 1685, his Protestant nephew the Duke of Monmouth was pressed to lead a rising which would be synchronized with a rebellion by the Earl of Argyll in Scotland. Monmouth landed at Lyme Regis on 11 June and was proclaimed king in Taunton. Local men -but few notables -flocked to join him, and he had the best of a clash with the Earl of Feversham's royal army on the 27th. He then heard that Argyll had been executed, and fell back to Bridgwater. Feversham followed, establishing himself at Westonzoyland. He had about 2, 700 regulars (including Marlborough) to Monmouth's 3, 500 largely untrained men. Monmouth decided on a night attack, but his men were detected by a cavalry vedette and discovered that a wide drainage ditch, the Bussex Rhine, lay between them and Feversham. Although they fought with courage they were no match for the firepower of the royal infantry, and as they broke Feversham's horse cut many of them down. The rebellion was suppressed with a savagery still remembered in the West Country. Monmouth himself was captured, and executed by a headsman who botched the job entirely.;x

EVENTHIST164255;The Bloody Assizes were a series of trials carried out in the aftermath of the Battle of Sedgemoor, which ended the Monmouth Rebellion in England. There were five judges: Sir William Montague, Sir Robert Wright, Sir Francis Wythens, Sir Creswell Levinz and Sir Henry Polexfen, led by Lord Chief Justice George ''The Hanging Judge'' Jeffreys. Over a thousand rebels were in prison awaiting the trials, which started in Winchester on 26th August. The first notable trial was that of an elderly gentlewoman called Dame Alice Lyle. The jury reluctantly found her guilty, and, the law recognizing no distinction between principals and accessories in treason, she was sentenced to be burned. This was commuted to beheading, with the sentence being carried out in Winchester market-place on 2 September 1685. From Winchester the court proceeded to Salisbury, Dorchester and on to Taunton, before finishing up at Wells on 23 September. More than 1,400 prisoners were dealt with and although most were sentenced to death, only around were hanged or hanged, drawn and quartered. The Taunton Assize took place in the Great Hall of Taunton Castle - of the 500 prisoners brought before the court on the 18th/19th September, 144 were hanged and their remains displayed around the county for all to see and know what happened to those who rebelled against King James.;x

EVENTNAME164260;Henry Purcell;x
EVENTHIST164260;Henry Purcell was an English Baroque composer. He has often been called England's first native composer, as though Purcell incorporated Italian and French stylistic elements into his music, he crafted a peculiarly English style. Purcell's earliest works include an ode to the birthday of King Charles II in 1670, various compositions during his appointment as organist at Westminster Abbey in 1680, at the age of just twenty two - throughout this period he composed music for literary contemporaries including John Dryden, Thomas Shadwell, Aphra Behn, John Playford, and even wrote overtures for Shakespeare. In 1685, Purcell penned two of his greatest pieces, 'I was glad' and 'My heart is inditing', for the coronation of King James II. Perhaps Purcell's greatest legacy, however, was his 'Music for the Funeral of Queen Mary' on the latter's death in December 1694. Only a year later Purcell himself died - he was only in his mid thirties and at the height of his influence. Henry Purcell is buried opposite the organ at Westminster Abbey, his epitaph reads: ''Here lyes Henry Purcell Esq., who left this life and is gone to that blessed place where only his harmony can be exceeded.'';x

EVENTNAME164261;The Regency Bill 1789;x
EVENTHIST164261;The Regency Bill of 1789 was a proposed Act of Parliament to provide that King George III's eldest son Prince George, Prince of Wales would act as Regent due to the King's incapacity through mental illness. With no legislation already in place, there was no legal basis for providing a regent, and the King was in no fit state to give Royal Assent to the act. Parliament decided to have the Lord Chancellor approve the bill by fixing the Great Seal of the Realm to give Royal Assent. However, the King recovered in time before the bill could be passed. The Duke of York and others thought the act illegal, but following his recovery, the King declared that the government had acted correctly. The King's continuing mental problems throughout the rest of his life confirmed the need for a suitable Regency Act to be in place. However, the King was hostile to the passing of such an act while he was of sound mind.;x

EVENTHIST164262;By late 1810, King George III was once again overcome by mental illness, following the death of his youngest daughter, Princess Amelia. Parliament agreed to follow the precedent of 1789 - without the King's consent, the Lord Chancellor affixed the Great Seal of the Realm to letters patent naming Lords Commissioners. The Lords Commissioners, in the name of the King, signified the granting of the Royal Assent to a bill which became the 'Care of King During his Illness, &c. Act 1811.' Parliament restricted some of the powers of the Prince Regent, though these constraints expired one year after the passage of the Act. The importance of this Regency Act was that it did not require a Council of Regency, as required by previous legislation. One reason for this was that the Prince Regent was heir to the throne in any case, and would assume full powers upon his father's death.;x

EVENTNAME164263;The Nine Days' Queen;x
EVENTHIST164263;As fifteen year-old Edward VI lay dying in July 1553, his Catholic half-sister Mary was still the heiress presumptive to the throne. However, Edward named the Protestant heirs of his father's sister, Mary Tudor, as his successors in a will composed on his deathbed, probably under the persuasion of Northumberland. Both Edward and Northumberland knew that this effectively left the throne to Edward's cousin Jane Grey who, like them, was a staunch Protestant. Four days after King Edward's death, Northumberland had Lady Jane Grey proclaimed Queen of England. Within only nine days, Mary had managed to find sufficient support to ride into London in a triumphal procession on 19th July. Parliament had no choice but to declare Mary the rightful Queen and denounced and revoked Jane's proclamation as having been coerced. Nevertheless, many high-ranking nobles had proved themselves pliable to having Jane as Queen. Acting largely out of financial self-interest, they supported her even if only as part of a power struggle to keep the staunchly Catholic Mary from ascending the throne. Jane's rule ended quickly when the nobles abandoned their support once they realised Mary had won the day. Mary originally pardoned both Jane and her husband, though after a subsequent attempt by their supporters to seize the crown, Mary had them executed for high treason. Had the Protestant plot been successful, Jane would ruled in place of the unpopular and unpredictable Mary, though it is difficult to say what would have happened on the latter's death. Mary's much more popular Protestant half-sister, Elizabeth, would then have been heir, and with her claim being decidedly stronger than Jane's, she would have been her obvious successor, and may well even have been pressured into taking the throne for herself...;x

EVENTHIST164264;After Queen Jane's successful usurpation and coronation in 1553, Mary's chances of ascending her half-brother's throne became slimmer by the day. Despite several low-key revolts in her name, successive miscarriages by various Catholic nobles and a failed marriage proposal to the future King of Spain resulted only in Mary further alienating herself from the people of England. Living in almost complete isolation in the royal apartments at Windsor, Mary - guarded at all times by fervent Puritans hand-picked by the Queen - was given few diplomatic options, with letters to and from anyone known to be in anyway pro-Catholic being burnt before reaching her. For both Queens, however, the situation was a difficult one for as long as both of them lived. Despite being deeply unpopular amongst the majority of the English, Mary was the true heir to the throne, being both the eldest sister of Edward VI and daughter of Henry VIII. Jane, though firmly established as Queen and recognised as such among the Protestant powers of Europe, was a usurper, and as well as being excommunicated by the Pope, there were rumours that plans were being made to replace Jane with Mary's half-sister, the Protestant Elizabeth - a most dangerous proposition for Jane, as hitherto her one unwavering strength had been Mary's rabid Catholicism. To Parliament, the true maker and breaker of kings, the choice was a lot simpler: Jane would reign for as long as Mary lived, the crown being offered to the Princess Elizabeth upon her half-sister's death. None of the parties involved with this arrangement were particularly happy about it, but to Parliament it ensured both the Protestant Succession and the continuation of the Tudor dynasty in the male line. Legally and constitutionally the Protestant Succession of 1558 was sound - it was also considered acceptable by the majority of the English people, not to mention undoubtedly avoiding the inevitable civil war had either side taken power by force.;x

EVENTNAME164265;Stony Stratford;x
EVENTHIST164265;The rise of Richard of Gloucester to the throne of England was never an immediately obvious one. Gloucester had been exemplary in his continued loyalty and support towards King Edward during his lifetime, especially in stark contrast to their other brother, Clarence, who time and time again had rebelled against Edward's rule, and paid the ultimate price for it. Though the will of Edward IV no longer survives, historians generally believe that Gloucester was to be appointed Lord Protector during his nephew's minority. Afterall, Gloucester, along with Lord Hastings, was the single most loyal and experienced man in the Yorkist camp. Moreover, after Edward's issue he was heir to the throne. At Stony Stratford on the night of April 30th, 1483, Gloucester had Earl Rivers and Sir Richard Grey, the King's half-brother,  arrested for treason and sent to Pontefract Castle, one of Gloucester's northern strongholds. The securing of the young King's person was seen as an effective way of preserving the continuity and stability of the realm under those whom it was considered were best-placed to look after him, and at the time was certainly never perceived as a move against the King himself. Earl Rivers, the Queen's brother, was seen by the Woodville faction as an alternative to Gloucester as Lord Protector, and indeed, it is said that King Edward pleaded with his uncle not to arrest his Woodville favourites. Lord Hastings enthusiastically backed Gloucester's coup at Stony Stratford. Gloucester was simply protecting his nephew from the what was seen as the largely negative and highly suspicious influence of the Queen and her family. For as long as he commanded Hastings' loyalty and support, Gloucester's actions were vindicated.;x

EVENTNAME164266;The Great Betrayal;x
EVENTHIST164266;If there was one man who could be considered the perfect servant of the House of York, it was William Hastings. Hastings succeeded his father in service to the York family and through his allegiance became a trusted friend and military partner to the future Edward IV, whom he was to serve loyally all his life. He fought with Edward at the Battle of Mortimer's Cross and was present at the proclamation of Edward as king in London on March 4th 1461 and then when the new king secured his crown at the Battle of Towton shortly thereafter. Hastings was also one of the leaders of the 1475 expedition to France, as well as de facto ruler of the kingdom whenever Edward was ill or otherwise absent from court. With the establishment of the Yorkist regime, Hastings became one of the key figures in the realm, most importantly as Lord Chamberlain, an office he held for the duration of the reign and which made him one of the most important means of access to the king. He was also created Baron Hastings, a title reinforced by grants of land and office, primarily in Leicestershire and Northamptonshire. His importance in these years is recorded in a number of sources and was recognized by the greatest peer of the realm, Warwick the Kingmaker, who gave Hastings his widowed sister Katharine Neville in marriage. Furthermore, Hastings supported Gloucester in his coup at Stony Stratford, considering him a safe pair of hands in contrast to the unpredictable and power-hungry Woodville family. With time, however, Gloucester's ambitions boiled over - not content with having himself appointed undisputed Lord Protector after the arrest of Rivers and Grey, Gloucester had Hastings and his entourage arrested at a council meeting in the Tower in June, 1483. Without trial or even a valid sentence against him, Hastings was then immediately led out into the courtyard and executed. Gloucester knew that if he did indeed seek the throne, Hastings would have to go. Of course, he could have been spared, but it was clear from the outset that Hastings' loyalty was always going to be to the children of Edward IV, his sovereign and best friend. Dealing with a man so loyal and popular was always going to be difficult.;x

EVENTNAME164267;Hastings' Rebellion;x
EVENTHIST164267;Of all the mistakes and errors of judgment Richard III made during his brief reign, allowing his elder brother's best friend to live was probably the greatest. After being spared his life on the condition that he swear an oath of loyalty to Richard as his rightful sovereign, Hastings was seemingly out of danger, Richard, however, was not. On April 9th, 1485, the anniversary of Edward IV's death, Hastings and his faithful retainers rose up in revolt, demanding the trial of King Richard for his various wicked crimes against both the late King Edward and his family and the common people of England. Hastings' goals were to oust Richard, restore Edward V or his brother if either were alive, and put Richard on trial in a manner not too dissimilar to that which would bring about the downfall of Charles I. Though popular and respected by many, the fear of Richard's reprisal was greater, and Hastings' rebellion was put down relatively quickly. Hastings was executed and his lands being absorbed into the crown. To Richard, it was Pyrrhic victory, he'd defended his throne on the field of battle, and a major thorn in his side had been removed. On the other hand, his unpopularity with the common people, Hastings had been one of the few reminders of the success and popularity of Edward IV's later years. Now he was gone, and Richard would soon follow him.;x

EVENTNAME164268;The Court of King Edward;x
EVENTHIST164268;After the events of Stony Stratford, Earl Rivers' domination of the young King Edward V was complete. His only major rival had been Richard of Gloucester, the King's uncle, who had, rather surprisingly, decided to concede the Protectorate to Rivers on hearing the King's pleas to do so. On submitting to the young King's will, Gloucester retired to his powerbase in the North, which he would continue to rule on behalf of his nephew with great diligence and popularity until his death. From 1483 until Edward declared his majority in 1490, Rivers and the rest of the Woodville family ruled over an increasingly prosperous and stable kingdom. By 1490 the throne of England had been ruled by two Yorkist kings, the transition between the two being both undisputed and peaceful: a first since the death of Henry V in 1422. Richard of Gloucester never quite forgave the Queen and her family's increasing influence of his nephews, but not once after Stony Stratford did he mention the subject again, instead choosing to accept political defeat and remain a loyal - if embittered - subject of the King.;x
#;x
EVENTNAME164269;Titulus Regius;x
EVENTHIST164269;Titulus Regius was an Act of Parliament passed during Richard III's one and only parliament held in 1484, setting out in detail his claim to the throne. It is generally accepted that Titulus Regius incorporates the text of the petition presented by the Duke of Buckingham to the assembly of the Lords and Commons which met on June 25th 1483 at the Guildhall in London and which was presented to, and accepted by, the Duke of Gloucester on the following day, from which date he thereafter considered to be the beginning of his reign as Richard III. The Act makes a number of claims, the primary one being that Edward IV's childen were illegitimate. As it was the intention of Henry VII to marry Elizabeth of York, the eldest daughter of Edward IV and thereby 'unite' the divided houses of York and Lancaster, he did not want any doubts expressed regarding his future wife's status - the Act was therefore repealed and Henry ordered all copies of Titulus Regius destroyed. The text has only survived because it was copied into a work known as the Croyland Chronicle, a single copy of which survived and was discovered in 1619 by Sir George Buck, a noted Stuart historian. The Act goes on to confirm Richard's other brother Clarence's status as a traitor, and thus he (though already dead) and his successors were also barred from the throne. As such, Richard wished simply to tie up any loose ends as to the validity of his claim to the throne and the facts surrounding his nephews' illegitimacy.;x

EVENTNAME164270;The Protestant Succession;x
EVENTHIST164270;According to John Foxe's legendary account of his death, Edward VI's last words were: ''I am faint, Lord have mercy upon me, and take my spirit.'' The premature end of the life of England's first Protestant king had been foreseen by many, and with the martyrdom of that other great Protestant zealot, Thomas Cranmer, in 1556, the short-lived Anglican experiment seemed forever at an end, hastened by the ascension of the staunchly-Catholic Princess Mary in July 1553. In many ways, Mary Tudor was a complete disaster as Queen - not only did her failed marriage to the King of Spain result in many Englishmen beginning to view their ancient kingdom as nothing more than the northernmore outpost of the Habsburg empire, but the domestic policies of 'Bloody Mary' resulted in hundreds of innocent Protestants being burnt at the stake. Despite Mary's indisputable claim to the throne as Henry VIII's eldest legitimate child, many people had wondered whether 'Queen Jane' had not been a better idea afterall. In the end, however, the one thing which threatened to thrust the people of England further into darkness had, in fact, brought them back into the light: the apparent birth of a child in November 1558 - the heir to a combined Anglo-Spanish empire - turned out to be a fatal tumour. Mary died on the 17th of the month, the throne passing to the last-surviving child of Henry VIII, the Protestant Elizabeth: England's Golden Age had begun.;x

The Falashas were (still are) Jewish Ethiopians. Their origin is still debated, whether they are a lost tribe of Israel or Ethiopians converted from an archaic form of Christianity to Judaism. In any case they constituted a likely target to the beleaguered Orthodox Christians surrounded by Islam. The continuous campaigns against the Falashas were successful in greatly reducing their numbers.

Two years later he was crowned and consacrated at Aksum, the old capital, as Neguse Negest (King of Kings, or Emperor), receiving also his throne name, Amda Seyum (the pillar of Zion).

However over the centuries, Muslim faith had infiltrated Ethiopia to the point that seven of its Kingdoms had become Muslim: Ifat, Dawaro, Arbabini, Hadiya, Shakara, Bale and Dara. With the rise in power of Adal, Ethiopia became subject to periodic invasions, that were made extremely dangerous because many Muslim Ethiopians would side with the invader. That was the case of sultan Shihab Badlay, known as the Beast (Awen) Badlay, who in one campaing wrestled Bale from Ethiopia, and in another tried to do the same with Dawaro. Zara Yaqob met the challenge, and at the battle of Gomit it is told that he trespassed Badlay's neck with his lance. He then ordered his foe's body cut in pieces that he sent to all the cities in the Kingdom. With the recovery of Bale, and the crushing of Adal and her allies, Ethiopia had bough time.;x

EVENTHIST165009;A legal code written in the XIII century by a Christian Coptic of Egypt in Arabic, based on Roman, Byzantine and Ecclesiatical law, was translated on the orders of Zara Yaqob in 1450. He then started applying parts of it to his Kingdom, and for example appointed legal administrators to decide which cases were to be solved by local governors and which by central government. The measures were very succesful, and the code received the name of ''Laws of the Kings'' or Fetha Negest. In 1563 it will become the constitution of Ethiopia until 1931. The Fetha Negest was a cornerstone of the Feudal system that characterized imperial Ethiopia until its end.;x

EVENTHIST165010;In some aspects, Zara Yaqob was a great reformer, but what really defined Ethiopia was its religion, and the Negus was a profoundly religious man. Over centuries of isolation, with only a tenuous connection with the Patriarch in Alexandria, the Orthodox in Ethiopia had become split over several questions. Zara Yaqob sought to unify also the Ethiopian Church and imposed the cult of the Virgin Mary in all the churches. He indefatigably prosecuted other religions and all forms of deviations and heresies, to the point of putting to death three of his own daughters (he had over 54 offspring) together with many others on suspicion of idolatry. The example strongly impressed his subjects, that from then on considered him a saint.;x

EVENTHIST165011;The imperial court and the army numbered several thousands, and no place in Ethiopia could support their needs for food and firewood for more than four months, and therefore the emperors kept an itinerant court that could not return to the same place for 10 years, to allow for its recovery. But one night, a month after a group of heretics had been stoned to death, a bright light appeared in the sky. Interpreting the visit of Halley's Comet as God's approval, Zara Yaqob decided to place his capital on that particular spot. He built two churches and a palace, creating the first capital of Ethiopia, Debre Berhan. The city continued to flourish for a quarter of a century, until Yaqob's son, Baeda Maryam, decided to resume itinerancy. Afterwards Debre Berhan turned into a small village.;x

EVENTHIST165012;In his later years, Zara Yaqob became increasingly despotic and paranoid. He started killing anybody that opposed him. The suspicion that his family wanted to remove him was based in an attempted coup by his son Galawdewos and his Ras Bitwodad (Grand Duke) Iyasus in 1437 that resulted in their imprisonment. However in his later years, he started to become suspicious of everybody, and he ended ordering the beating of several of his sons, daughters and one of his wives, Empress Seyun Mogassa, who died as a result. The matter was further complicated because she was the mother of the heir. Although the church was able to repair the rift between father and son, the death of the mother of the future negus would have important consequences, as she had an important role to fulfill in the imperial court.;x

EVENTHIST165013;In 1487 Joao II of Portugal ordered Bartolomeu Dias around Africa by sea, but he also ordered his trusted spymaster and diplomat, Pêro da Covilhã, to reach India and the Kingdom of Prester John by land. Pêro da Covilhã spoke fluent arabic, and with a companion travelled to Mecca. From there he travelled alone to Goa and Calicut, learning about currents, winds and the origen of the different spices. He then returned to Cairo. From there he forwarded his information together with advise on the best sea-route to India to his King, before continuing to Aden, Ormuz, and Saylac, in the coast of Adal. He finally arrived to Ethiopia in 1490, being well received by Emperor Eskander. After four years of stay, he was preparing his departure, with a proposal of an alliance from the Emperor of Ethiopia to the King of Portugal, when Eskander died. He was succeded by his brother Na'od, after the death of his son. Na'od informed Pêro da Covilhã that he would have to remain in Ethiopia for the rest of his life according to the custom of the Kingdom, but rewarded him lavishly and named him court advisor.;x

EVENTNAME165015;Portuguese ambassadors;x
EVENTHIST165015;King Manuel of Portugal was very interested in preventing spice trade through the Red Sea. In 1520 a Portuguese fleet arrived and bombed Saylac, the port of Adal. They then proceeded to Massawa, the port of Ethiopia, where the Portuguese ambassadors dissembarked. They were prepared to sign an alliance with Ethiopia, but their timing was bad. Almost centenary Eleni had been dismissed, and her step great-grandson, Emperor Dawit II, better known as Lebna Dengel had just killed his main enemy, Imam Mahfuz of Adal. He was continuing a series of succesful campaigns against restless Muslims inside Ethiopia. Everybody was convinced that the Muslim menace had been checked, perhaps for good. Lebna Dengel gave his excuses to the ambassadors but said that Eleni's envoy lacked the authority to sign alliances. After a few years in the country, the ambassadors said goodbye to Pêro da Covilhã, who was now too old to travel, and left.;x

EVENTNAME165016;War of extermination;x
EVENTHIST165016;It was too bad that Lebna Dengel had dismissed the Portuguese ambassadors in 1526, because the next year and without warning Adal had started a war like no other in the history of Ethiopia. Lead by a mysterious warrior, that the Ethiopians called Grañ (Left-handed), and his men called Ahmad al-Fath (the Conqueror), the armies of Adal had been trained in Ottoman tactics, and were armed with flintlock firearms. The Ethiopians were great warriors. Raised in the highlands, they are one of the strongest populations on earth, and their armies were 5 to 10 times superior in numbers. Yet the only thing that they could do against the modern armies of Adal was to make them pay a hefty price for their victories. So they suffered a great defeat at the Awash river in the battle of Shimbra Kure in 1529. Lebna Dengel had 16,000 cavalry and 200,000 infantry against Ahmad 560 cavalry and 12,000 soldiers. Although the Ethiopians were able to kill 5,000 soldiers of Adal, their loses were much higher. Afterwards Ahmad penetrated deep into the highlands, attacking Dawaro and Shewa in 1531, then Amhara, Lasta, Bale, Hadya, Sidama and the Gurage. With half of former Ethiopia under his control, in 1535 Ahmad invaded Tigray in the North, sacking the sacred city of Aksum and destroying the Cathedral were the emperors had been crowned for centuries. But the worst part was the damage inflicted to the people of Ethiopia and Adal by Ahmad, that would change their demography forever. To finance his military campaign against his bigger neighbour, Ahmad used a scorched earth tactic, laying waste to the land and selling every Ethiopian he could capture, Muslim or Christian, as a slave. No Christian priest or nun was left alive by him. Lebna Dengel, outmaneuvered and out-musketed, fled from one province to another, trying to organize the resistance. There was no possibility of a peace agreement, as Ahmad was bent on the destruction of the Christian country. His elder son, Fiqtor, was killed in battle, and the youngest, Menas, was captured and sent as a slave to the Ottoman overlord of Yemen. In desperation, Lebna Dengel sent a plee for help to the King of Portugal. In doing that, he saved his country, but he would not see the result, as he died on the run, exhausted and miserable in 1540.;x

EVENTNAME165017;Portuguese help arrives;x
EVENTHIST165017;When the Portuguese finally arrived, Ethiopia was in the verge of disintegration. The young Emperor Gelawdewos (Claudius) was on hiding with just a handful of loyals. His mother the Empress Sabla Wengel was under siege at the mountain of Debre Damo. The King of Portugal had sent Cristovão da Gama, son of famous explorer Vasco da Gama and brother of the Viceroy of India, Estevão da Gama. He came with 400 soldiers and 1000 arquebuses, plus some small cannons, but in Africa they were the equivalent of a full army. They didn't lose time and defeated Ahmad Grañ three times in 1541. After the rainy season they met him again overconfident, but Ahmed had petitioned help to the Ottoman bey of Yemen, Zebid Pasha, offering vassalage, and he was granted 900 Turkish soldiers and additional arms. At the battle of Wofla, on August 28, 1542, the Portuguese were defeated by the far superior army of Ahmad. Over half of them were killed, and the wounded Cristovão was captured, tortured and eventually beheaded. Believing the Portuguese destroyed, Ahmed dismissed 600 of the Ottomans to other duties, but was then confronted by the remaining Portuguese and the army of Gelawdewos, rearmed with the stored weapons. The battle of Wayna-Daga on February 21, 1543, was initially indecisive, but the Portuguese had sworn to avenge their leader, and singling out Ahmad, killed him. His army fell in confusion and was completely destroyed. The remaining of the forces of Adal abandoned Ethiopia and fell back to Harar. The war continued, now favorable to Ethiopia, and Bale was recovered.;x

EVENTHIST165018;Despite their severe defeat, and the sacking of Harar in 1550, Adal regrouped under the leadership of Ahmad's nephew, Nur ibn Mujtahid. In 1556 he launched a two front coordinated attack with Ottoman help. The Ottomans, leaded by Ozdemur Pasha, conquered Massawa, the best port of the Red Sea, and the only one the Ethiopians had, but their attempt to reach the highlands failed against the determined resistance of Gelawdewos. The attack by Nur was an even worse failure, taking the life of the last of the Walashma sultans of Adal, Barakat. However Emperor Gelawdewos lost his life in battle and his head was taken to Harar. The loss of the port of Massawa to the Ottomans was a worse catastrophe for Ethiopia. They lost control of their trade, they could no longer buy firearms, and anybody traveling from the outside to Ethiopia had to do so in disguise. Never had been Ethiopia so isolated from the outside world.;x

EVENTHIST165019;Dobe'a were primitive nomadic people who inhabited the northeastern part of Ethiopia and bordering parts of Adal sultanate. Nomadic cattle herding and banditry were there only two professions, and the latter caused the decisive campaign of Emperor Baeda Maryam against Dobe'a. First invasion into Dobe'a lands proved fruitless as the crafty nomads were able to flee and hide from the Emperor's troops. This failure prompted Baeda Maryam to seek aid from his vassals. Despite their great loyalty in this campaign, probably because they too were threatened by Dobe'a raids, the camapaign suffered a sound defeat when the Dobe'a were finally found. Only when the furious Emperor called his elite regiment, the Royal Eagle, did the campaign turn from disaster into success and the Dobe'a were broken. Baeda Maryam mobilized his governors to pursue the fleeing non-combatants. Many Dobe'a were slain during those pursuits and massive herds of cattle captured.;x

EVENTNAME165020;The disintegration of Adal;x
EVENTHIST165020;By 1567, the sultanate of Adal had been reduced to the city of Harar and the Oromo had cut her vital connection to the ports of Saylac and Barbera. What had been Adal disintegrated, part falling under control of Somalies, and most becoming Oromo lands. The Ottomans took control of the Red Sea ports as payment for their help. In 1575, Emir Muhammad IV made the mistake of joining the rebellion of the governor of a Muslim province in the North East of Ethiopia. He was captured and executed by Emperor Sarsa Dengel, and this defeat saw the end of Adal's last army. In 1577, the emir transferred the sultanate of Adal to the Aussa oasis in the Danakil depression. This desert below sea-level was located in no-mans land between the Afars, the Ottomans at Massawa and the Ethiopians. By moving to one of the nastiest places in Africa the sultanate prolonged its nominal existence until it was overrun by Afars and Oromo in 1672. The city of Harar, remained viable behind its walls, independent from the sultanate since 1647, as a city-state. It always has been Muslim, and today is considered the fourth sacred city of Islam. For all practical purposes, 1577 saw the end of Adal as a state. The Ethiopians probably didn't notice it. Due to the Oromo they had lost control over most of the South, that was self-ruled by petty Kingdoms.;x

EVENTHIST165021;The pity state to which Ethiopia had been reduced by the concerted attacks of Adal, the Ottomans and the Oromo, was further complicated by the death of Emperor Gelawdewos in battle against Adal, and his brother Menas of disease. Menas' son, prince Yishaq was only 14 years old. He took the King name of Sarsa Dengel, and was crowned as Malik Sagad, meaning ''To whom the Muslims bow''. He would make good his title, as soon he revealed himself as an extraordinary military leader. He destroyed once and for all the power of Adal in 1576, contributing to its final demise. In a series of campaigns, he completely broke the power of the non-Talmudic Jewish Falashas, turning them into a silent minority. He defeated the Kingdom of Kefa, forcing his King to accept Christianity as the official religion, although the population did not convert. And he twice defeated the Turks, in 1578 and 1589, keeping them confined to the port of Massawa. Unfortunately he died before his time, after eating fish from a river ha had been warned by monks not to eat. Since his sons were too young, he had named his nephew Za Dengel as his heir.

But Za Dengel with the help of the powerful Ras (Duke) Za Selassie, and his cousin Susenyos, was capable of seizing the crown in 1603. Then Pedro Páez arrived to Ethiopia. He was a Spanish Jesuit from Madrid, who had studied at Coimbra, and had been sent to Ethiopia during the union of the crowns of Portugal and Spain. He soon learned not only Amharic, the court language, but also Ge'ez, the Ethiopian church language. He was an amazing man, and brought with him an Indian architect that revolutionized construction techniques in Ethiopia. Páez built several churches in Ethiopia, and the local architects learned their techniques. Those techniques would be later used in the castles of Gonder. Impressed by the many talents of Páez, and his prudence, Za Dengel named him his counselor.;x

The Orthodox Church and his former supporter Ras Za Selassie took the side of former emperor Malik Sagad II Yaqob, and raised in arms. After defeating Za Dengel, Za Selassie had his eyes removed, his fingers cut, and then he had him trampled by horses to death. Yaqob was crowned again.

EVENTHIST165026;Susenyos refused to accept Yaqob as emperor, having been very close to his cousin Za Dengel. Susenyos had little chance against the nobility supporting Yaqob. However Susenyos was a resourceful military commander, and he enlisted the Oromo on his side. The Oromo had a very high military capability, and for the first time they were involved in the politics of their new country. From then on, the Oromo were a factor to be taken into consideration, becoming little by little the backbone of the Ethiopian army. Susenyos knew what he was doing. After defeating Ras Za Selassie, who took his side, he presented battle to the emperor Malik Sagad II Yaqob. During the battle Yaqob was killed, but his body was never found. To show the involvement of the Ethiopian Church in politics, the Abuna (Patriarch) Petros took command of Yaqob's army until he was also killed. Something that the Church would never forgive Susenyos. Emperor Susenyos was relatively removed from the main branch of the Solomonic Kings of Ethiopia, starting the so-called Gonder line. To tighten lose ends, he had one of Yaqob's sons strangled, and organized a military expedition against the Kingdom of Sennar (Nubia), where another son was rising an army, forcing him to exile to Rome. He also had two brothers of Yaqob beheaded. Susenyos also wrote several letters to Felipe III of Spain/Portugal asking for military help, but he never got it.;x

Thus the Spaniard was the first European to see it and write about it, 150 years before Scottish James Bruce claimed the same feat. He was also the first European to describe the taste of coffee. Unfortunately his writings were not published until 1945. In his search of an alliance with Portugal, Susenyos finally decided to convert into Catholicism.

Located in the route between Gonder and Massawa, its possession gave him control of the main trade route in Ethiopia. By imposing taxes on trade, Mikael Sehul raised armies equipped with modern muskets. In 1759 he was made Ras of Tigray after getting rid of the previous one. He also married a daughter of Empress Mentewab, gaining the support of her powerful party. When the confrontation between Mentewab and her daughter-in-law Wobit, was about to start a civil war, he was called by the first to Gonder. He arrived with an army of 26,000 men, and displaced both parties, creating his own, based on the Amharic Christian nobility. He soon started squashing rebellions and defeating other parties, becoming the most powerful man in Ethiopia. He was recognized as such and the emperor was forced to invest him as Ras Bitwodad and Enderease (Viceroy) in 1768.

EVENTHIST165045;Nicolò Brancaleon was a Venetian monk who came to Ethiopia with a goal of converting their greatest Emperor, Zara Yaqob, to Catholicism. Unfortunately for him, Nicolò was a great painter and Ethiopian Emperors had a tradition of forbidding skilled foreign missionaries and explorers to leave Ethiopia. Nicolò Brancaleon founded a studio and quickly became the foremost icon and fresco painter and illustrator of religious books. His best known work is the controversial fresco Madonna and Child at the Church of Atronsa Maryam which was destroyed by the Oromo in 1704. His works were still being discovered in Ethiopia in 20th century. After Nicolò's arrival, at least 17 more skilled Italians were imprisoned at the Emperor's court.;x

EVENTHIST351002;Gaston IV of Foix had married Leonor, the third child of Queen Blanca of Navarre. His chances to the throne were slim until Carlos, heir of Navarre, started a war against his father Juan, King of Aragon, who had illegally retained the crown of Navarre from him. When Carlos died, he bequeathed his right to Navarre to his sister Blanca, who also opposed her father. Juan, in the midst of a civil war, sought the help of the King of France and named Leonor heir to Navarre, and together with Gaston, governors of the Kingdom. For this arrangement to work, the legal heir had to disappear, and Gaston had Blanca imprisoned and probably killed. Now that Leonor was heir to Navarre, Juan was lasting too long, so with the support of the Navarrese Beaumont party, Leonor and Gaston took arms against him. Since Juan had run out of heirs, he named Leonor's son, also Gaston, as the new heir. But Gaston de Foix-Navarre, married to the daughter of the King of France, died in a tournament in 1470. Without much choice, Juan and Leonor reconciled again.;x

EVENTNAME3107;The League of Cambrai;x
EVENTHIST3107;Since 1495, Venice had been holding the main ports of Apulia despite Aragonese claims to have them back. With the French invasion of Milan, Venice had acquired Milanese territories east of the Adda River, and upon the fall of Cesare Borgia had also acquired Rimini, Faenza and Ravenna, against the will of Pope Julius II. The Venetians also held Veneto and Friuli, on which Maximilian of Habsburg had imperial claims. In late 1507 Maximilian announced his intention to travel to Italy to receive the imperial investiture from the Pope himself, and in early 1508 he assembled a big army to escort him down to Rome. He requested free passage through Venetian territories, but was told that he would be allowed passage only without his army. Enraged at the answer, Maximilian attacked Venice, but this decision proved unwise: Venice not only routed the imperial army but also seized the imperial cities of Trieste, Gorz and Fiume. A second assault by a Tyrolean force several weeks later was an even greater failure, forcing Maximilian to conclude a humiliating three-year truce. With Pope Julius II's assent, Maximilian took the title of 'Emperor-elect', thus breaking the century-old custom that the Holy Roman Emperor had to be crowned by the Pope. Shortly afterward, Venice provided a pretext for war by appointing her own candidate to the vacant bishopric of Vicenza. The Emperor, the King of France and Ferdinand of Aragon gathered in Cambrai in December 1508 to sign a treaty which seemed to be a defensive alliance against the Turk. In reality they meant to form a league to attack Venice and deprive the Serenissima of most of her mainland territories. Pope Julius II, after a renewed Venetian refusal to give the Romagna lands back to the Papacy, ratified the treaty and at the same time proceeded to excommunicate all Venetian citizens. Ferrara and Mantua, each with separate claims to territories held by Venice, joined the league as well. In April 1509 military operations started, and a month later French troops decimated one of the two Venetian armies at the battle of Agnadello. Even though in August 1509 Venice managed to eliminate Mantua from the war, she still faced the collapse of her strategic position and had by February 24, 1510 to accept the papal demands on the cities she had occupied in Romagna. However, Pope Julius II was still not satisfied and demanded that the war be prosecuted until Venice conceded control over their church to the Pope and compensated him for his expenses. The Council of Ten had privately resolved that the terms had been accepted under duress and were therefore invalid, and that Venice should violate them at the earliest opportunity. This opportunity presented itself shortly afterward.;x

After two years of contrasts between moderates (Feuillants), favorable to a King's support in political reforms such as a new Constitution, radical republicans (the Montagnards), asking for his immediate deposition, and between them the opportunist Girondins, worsened by the external propaganda of 'emigrés' nobles and the fears of suspected plots to reestablish the old regime, a definitive decision was to be made about the King in order to save the revolution. Since circumstantial evidences showed that the formerly King of the French, now addressed as 'Citoyen Capet', had conspired with foreign powers, Louis XVI was deposed the 21 September 1792 and committed for trial with the accusation of treason. On 15 Jan 1793 the National Convention voted for a proposal to execute immediately the King with the figures 387 votes against 334. On 21 Jan 1793 King Louis was 'guillotined'. The regicide provoked deep resentments amongst the European sovereigns.;x

EVENTHIST3148;In November of 1799, Napoléon took part in the coup d'Etat of 18 and 19 Brumaire (9 and 10 November). Two members of the Directory (Sieyès and Ducos) needing a popular general to neutralize the army and inspire the people, decided to use Napoléon. Violence broke out during the council session, which was quelled by Napoléon's soldiers (some of the council fled through the windows). The remaining council members approved a provisional executive government of three consuls. Napoléon was able to in effect seize power by having himself proclaimed First Consul. His position and a new constitution were shortly confirmed by popular vote, and the coming years he was able to unify the nation and reform the finances and all levels of government.;x

The result was known as the Grand Empire. In a glamorous crowning Napoléon picked his crown from the hands of the Pope and put it on his own head. Then he started to readdress Europe. Having annexed Tuscany, Piedmont, Genoa, and the Rhineland directly into France, Napoléon placed the Kingdom of Holland (which until 1806 was the Batavian Commonwealth) under his brother Louis, the Kingdom of Westphalia under his brother Jérôme, the Kingdom of Italy under his stepson Eugène as his viceroy, the Kingdom of Spain under his brother Joseph, and the Grand Duchy of Warsaw (carved out of Prussian Poland) under the nominal sovereignty of his ally the King of Saxony. To link his allied states in northern and southern Germany, Napoléon created the Confederation of the Rhine.

But the choice of which prince should marry the duchess would be of particular importance for the future political and economical stability of Western Europe, so he urged Mary to accept his son, the Dauphin Charles, as husband, in order to secure the inheritance of the Low Countries for his descendants too, even by force of arms if necessary.

EVENTHIST3734;The political sickness of the Polish body manifested itself fully after the death of Jan III Sobieski in 1696. The election that followed was one of the most dismal episodes in Polish parliamentary history. The primary candidates were the King's son Jakub Sobieski, Francois Louis de Bourbon, Prince de Conti, and Friedrich Augustus Wettin, Elector of Saxony. Jakub Sobieski was in Silesia at the time and was unlucky enough to be arrested by Saxon troops. On 37th June 1697 the Szlachta assembled on the election field voted overwhelmingly for the Prince de Conti and the Primate proclaimed him King. On the same evening a small group of malcontents 'elected' Friedrich Augustus, who marched into Poland at the head of a Saxon army. On September 15th, as the Prince de Conti, escorted by a French squadron under Jean Bart, was sailing through the Sound, Friedrich Augustus was crowned in Kraków by the Bishop of Kujavia as Augustus II of Poland. At the end of the month the Prince of Conti came ashore only to discover that he had been pipped at the post. His supporters were far more numerous than Augustus and they immediately to certain precautions showing off strength and surrounding the now unsupplied Saxon army. Augustus inauguration did not become what he had hoped for. He had hoped for the Crown of Poland, but what he got was a truce and a chance to sneak back to Saxony again.

Stanislaw, besieged at Danzig, received only moral support from France, while his rival was backed by Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI and had full military aid from Russia. Stanislaw was obliged to flee from Danzig in 1734, and in 1735 he accepted the terms of the preliminary Treaty of Vienna. He kept the royal title but renounced his actual rights in favor of Augustus III. In exchange, he received Lorraine and Bar, with the provision that they were to pass directly to the French crown upon his death.

EVENTHIST3781;The Directory was the French revolutionary government set up by the Constitution of the Year III, which lasted four years, from November 1795 to November 1799. The Directors chose governmental ministers, ambassadors, army generals, tax collectors, and other officials. However, they had no funds to finance their projects or courts to enforce their will. The Directory was perhaps the most corrupt regime that France has ever known. Its policies were aimed, first, at protecting and increasing the profits of those in political and economic power and, second, at preventing the return of the Bourbons or the establishment of any other regime that might endanger those in power by such means as the redistribution of national property. The period was also noted for extravagant fashions in dress, excesses in entertainment, and a loose morality. However, the most important aspect of the directory and what gave it legitimacy in the eyes of the people, even as it was corrupt, was that it had ended the Reign of Terror.

EVENTHIST3785;Many countries had viewed the French revolution with neutral mistrust or eager interest, but with the Reign of Terror and the Execution of King Louis most countries became abhorred. The New Republic and its ideas undermined the 'Old Order' that existed in most European countries. Those several alliances were set up to restore the Bourbons to the French Throne, crush the revolution and get Europe back to normal again. This succeeded in 1814 and again in 1815 when foreign armies brought Louis XVIII on the throne. Louis XVIII was the brother of the Executed King Louis of France and in early life was known as the Comte de Provence. He remained in Paris after the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789 but escaped to Belgium two years later. After King Louis' execution in 1793 he proclaimed himself regent, and after the death of his brother's heir in 1795, he took the title Louis XVIII. He lived as an exile in various European countries until he became King after Napoléon's first abdication in 1814. On Napoléon's return to power in 1815, however, Louis again fled to Belgium.;x

Napoléon abdicated, first in favor of his son and then unconditionally (Apr. 11). He was exiled to Elba, which the allies gave him as a sovereign principality. His victors were still deliberating at the Congress of Vienna when Napoléon, with a handful of followers, landed near Cannes (Mar. 1, 1815). King Louis XVIII reacted and sent Marshal Ney with a considerable force to capture Napoléon and bring him to Paris in an Iron Cage. But Ney did not follow the orders of his new master, but returned to the side of his old. In the course of a triumphant march northward Napoléon once more rallied France behind him.

EVENTNAME12021;The Angevin inheritance of Naples;x
EVENTHIST12021;Charles VIII, King of France, was a throwback as he still lived lost in a world of chivalry. He clearly had a grand design, probably inspired by the Spanish Reconquista and the rise of the Ottoman Turks, of a crusade versus the infidels and the recapture of Jerusalem, the capital city of Christendom. He based his plan on a nebulous claim through the testament in which Charles IV Duke of Anjou bequeathed Louis XI, his cousin and Charles' father, the inheritance of Naples and the subsequent title of King of Sicily. His ambitions were well known to the Duke of Milan who, convinced to solve his problems with the King of Naples, sent his ambassadors, the Count of Belgioioso and the Count of Caiazzo, to speak to the great lords of the Royal Council of France about the legality of Charles VIII's claim to the Kingdom of Naples, about the weakness of the Neapolitan armies, and about the glory the conquest of Naples would bring to France. In the meanwhile some Neapolitan exiles in France, amongst them Antonello Sanseverino, who escaped the baronal persecutions in Naples in 1487, assured that the Neapolitan people would have agreed on a French intervention. Most of the great lords of the Royal Council were against an attack on Naples, seeing it as very expensive and very dangerous and argued that Charles VIII was too inexperienced to fight a war and that his advisors were weak and foolish to trust il Moro, known all over Italy for his treachery. But the young Charles VIII, who was carried away by a thirst for glory and a desire to conquer the Kingdom of Naples, paid very little attention to their arguments and heard instead the advice of his own advisors, many of them already corrupted by the money and promises of il Moro's emissaries with the lure of getting land and estates in the Kingdom of Naples and ecclesiastical positions from the Pope. Finally, after several days' debate, Charles VIII signed a secret agreement with il Moro's ambassadors, by which it was agreed that Charles VIII would send an army to invade the Kingdom of Naples and Milan would provide men, money and free passage. To have his hands free in Italy, Charles made ruinous pacts with all his neighbours, so they would not interfere. A large sum of money was given to Henry VII of England while the Roussillon was given to Ferdinand King of Aragon and the counties of Artois and Franche-Comté were ceded to Maximilian I King of the Romans and regent of Burgundy, thus sacrificing essential territories to the strategic defence of France for his chivalric dream.;x

On his accession, he took the titles of Duke of Milan and King of Sicily, sending a shrounding chill through Italy, especially to Ludovico Sforza, who had seized Milan from his nephew Gian Galeazzo, and that upon his death, had seen his claim legitimized by Maximilian King of the Romans. Louis XII came to throne in France with the clear idea of avenging his previous defeat by Ludovico and make good his claim to Milan from his Visconti grandmother. Milan and her dependency, Genoa, were seen as the key to Italy. So Louis XII, preparing to make good his claim on Milan, wanted to enlist the help of the main Italian powers, to avoid the mistakes of his cousin Charles VIII. In the meanwhile the anti-Venetian sentiment had been running high, attempts were made by Italian ambassadors to poison the relationships between Venice and the Ottoman Empire and try to induce the latter to declare war to the former. It was clear that Venice could very well side with the French and that occurred with the stipulation of the treaty of Blois, where Venice would recognize French claims to Milan and in exchange for military support and money would receive the Milanese territories east of the Adda river. Louis then stipulated a peace treaty with Ferdinand of Spain and enforced the truce with Maximilian of Habsburg. He made also a pact with Pope Alexander VI: in exchange for a papal bull to annul his marriage to the crippled sister of late Charles VIII and marry Charles' widow, Anne of Brittany, the Pope's son, Cesare Borgia, received the duchy of Valentinois with the hand of Charlotte d'Albret, sister to the King of Navarre and a promise of French military support to form his own duchy in Romagna. After having secured his friendship with Philibert II of Savoy Louis XII crossed the Alps and assembled his powerful army in Asti, a small county in Piedmont that belonged to the House of Orléans as marriage dowry of Valentina Visconti, his grandmother. In the summer of 1499, the French army led by Gian Giacomo Trivulzio, a Milanese noble, invaded the duchy of Milan from West, in the meanwhile, a Venetian army attacked from East. Town after town surrendered and the Milanese armies disappeared. As soon as a revolt broke out in Milan, Ludovico left the city together with his family and his treasure. By September 1499 the French troops made their entrance in Milan warmly welcome by the population.;x

EVENTNAME12025;French troops abandon Milan;x
EVENTHIST12025;In spite of their victories in Northern Italy, the French troops were forced to abandon the battlefield both because of financial reasons and because after the successful battle of Ravenna the Emperor was withdrawing troops and would have joined the holy league formed by Papal States, Spain, England and Venice with the help of Swiss troops hired by Pope Julius II himself and led into war by the Bishop of Sion, Mathias Schiner. Thence the decision to withdraw from Milan. Julius II recovered Ravenna, Bologna and the rest of the Romagna, while his commander, the Duke of Urbino, easily occupied Reggio and Modena, though Alfonso d'Este refused any settlement that would deprive him of Ferrara. After having chased out the French from Italy, the congress of allies which met at Mantua in August made over to the Pope Parma and Piacenza, to which he had at best a shadowy claim. The Emperor and Fernando would have been glad to give Milan to their grandson Charles but the Swiss were in possession and, supported by the Pope, made their will good. The duchy was given to Ercole Massimiliano Sforza, the elder son of Ludovico. The Venetian claims were left unsettled with Brescia still held out and the Swiss claiming Cremona and the Ghiara d'Adda for the duchy. And more, the Emperor demanded Vicenza and Verona. Florence, who in 1509 had ended her long war by the recovery of Pisa, was punished for her support of France by the restoration of the Medici. Entering Milan, Ercole Massimiliano Sforza received the keys to the city from the Swiss soldiers, who promised to protect the duchy of Milan and to help the Duke in sending to him all the troops he would need. The Duke granted them the acquisition of the ducal territories Ticino and Valtellina, the most important accesses to the Alpine passes. Genoa drew back its allegiance to the French King, who in 1506 harshly repressed a local rebellion that broke out owing to the decision taken by the French governor to grant privileges to the nobilty. But Julius II made also a treaty with his late ally, Maximilian, against Venice. The emperor was to support the Lateran council to oppose that one proclaimed by Louis XII in Pisa and to hand over Modena to the Pope, while Julius II was to join in compelling Venice to give up the fiefs which the Emperor claimed since Cambrai and to use on behalf of his new ally also the always convincing 'spiritual weapons'. When this treaty was made public, it had only the effect to drive Venice to side with France.;x

EVENTNAME12027;François Ier against the Empire;x
EVENTHIST12027;On the 24 of February 1525, in the battle of Pavia, the imperial armies led by Ferdinando Francesco d'Avalos, Marquis of Pescara (also winner at Bicocca in 1522), decimated the French troops led by King François Ier. Many French leaders died on the battlefield, such as De la Tremoille, La Palice and Bonnivet. King François Ier, instead, fell from his horse shot out under him, and taken captive. Since 24 February was Charles V's 25th birthday, the Valois was the biggest gift he could ever receive. François was carted off to Madrid, where he was held six months in prison for ransom, and pressed to renounce his claims in Italy and Flanders, to give Bourgogne back to the Empire and to concede the county of Provence to Charles, Connétable de Bourbon, and now leader of the imperial troops. The Emperor believed that the peace with France had finally been achieved after François Ier, agreeing to renounce his claims in Italy, was freed and retaken to France, leaving his sons there as hostages and guarantees for the respect of the treaty. But within two months of his release and in spite of his sons taken as hostages in Spain, François Ier got the Parliament of Paris to void all the terms of the Treaty of Madrid because accepted under duress and in 1526 at Cognac he stipulated a holy league bringing into it Pope Clement VII together with Florence, Venice, Henry VIII of England and also the Duke of Milan, who even if previously restored to the throne by Charles V himself, voluntarily joined the alliance made to stop the Spanish hegemony over Italy.;x

EVENTHIST3108;Any league to stop Spanish hegemony didn't prove to be a solid alliance against Charles V troops (in fact, The Pope, taken captive by the lansquenets sacking Rome, abandoned the League of Cognac).. Genoa, important for military supply to the French troops fighting in Southern Italy, had turned to Spain thanks to the decisions of Andrea Doria who, dissatisfied by François Ier's misbehaviour to the Republic, preferred to offer his services to the Emperor. Since the military campaign in Italy was becoming too expensive for both sides and the political instability in the Empire due to religious conflicts was worsening, Louise of Savoy, François Ier's mother and regent of France, together with Margarete of Habsburg, Charles V's aunt and his representative in the administration of the Burgundian dominions, stipulated a peace treaty at Cambrai on 5 august 1529. The so called Ladies' Peace was successful, the signatories were the only ones who could have influence in the political decisions of the two monarchs and managed to induce them to make peace for the wealth of their respective countries. Signing that treaty, France had to renounce her claims to Milan, Asti, Flanders and Artois, while Spain gave up her inheritance rights to the Duchy of Bourgogne, a French fief. François Ier had also to withdraw all his troops from Italy and marry Eleanor, Charles's sister, in return for the liberation of his two sons, hostages at the Spanish court because of François Ier's disrespect for the treaty of Madrid. At Cambrai France abandoned her plans of expansionism in Italy while all her Italian allies joining an Anti-Spanish league would be now at the Emperor's mercy. The Republic of Florence would experience Charles V's rule.;x

But in 1635 the Emperor and the German princes stipulated a peace treaty in Prague, with which the Protestant rulers were allowed to retain secularized bishoprics held by them in 1627, the enforcement of the Edict of Restitution was delayed for 40 years, the armies of the Emperor and of the German states were reunited to one imperial army and the German princes were forbidden to have alliances between them or with foreign powers. Since this treaty acknowledged the authority of the Habsburg party in the Empire and subsequently it renewed the threat for France of being surrounded at her borders, Cardinal Richelieu decided it was the moment for France to enter a preventive war against Spain and Austria.

They were partly inspired by more liberal ideas imported from Britain, and also by John Locke. They became increasingly opposed to the power of the clergy, the King, and the nobility. During the eighteenth century these institutions had far more power in France than they had in England.

EVENTHIST12106;The unpopularity of Louis XVI haughty wife, Marie-Antoinette, accentuated the public's lack of confidence in the throne. Unhappy in marriage, Marie-Antoinette lived extravagantly and was embroiled in scandal. In 1785, she became entangled in a steamy scandal when a cardinal, the former Ambassador to the Habsburgs, gave her a fabulous diamond neckalce in the hope of winning her favor. The necklace and some of the prelate's money were then deftly stolen by mysterious plotters, a strange scenario that included a prostitute posing as the Queen.;x

EVENTNAME12112;The Storming of the Bastille;x
EVENTHIST12112;After the revolt of the Third Estate, the King offered a variety of concessions in an attempt to maintain order. The third estate was unsatisfied. On July 14th, 1789, thousands of people seized weapons stored in the Invalides, a veteran's hospital. Early that afternoon, about 80,000 armed Parisians stormed and captured the Bastille. More than 200 of the attackers were killed or wounded. A butcher decapitated the commander of the fortress and the throng carried his head on a pike through the streets.;x

EVENTNAME12113;The Night of the Ancien Régime;x
EVENTHIST12113;Following the fall of the Bastille, the King was essentially forced to acknowledge the legitimacy of the National Assembly. In a remarkable session on the night of August 4th, the National Assembly swept away much of the old regime, including seigneurial rights and powers. No longer would the King rule by divine right, or buy allegiance by dispensing privileges to favorites. The Assembly began drafting the 'Declaration of the Rights of Man' and a new French constitution. The days of the French Monarchy were perhaps numbered.;x

EVENTNAME12114;The French Revolutionary Wars;x
EVENTHIST12114;With the creation of a Legislative Assembly to limit the monarchic power, several reasons pushed France towards war in 1792. Internally, the republican party of the Girondins were calling for a war to rid Europe of monarchy and despotism but also to rid France of any internal reactions. Externally, the nobility, the socalled emigrés, fleeing to Austria and Prussia requested that those powers intervene to restore the French monarchy. Louis XVI, King of the French, saw in a war failure the possibility to restore absolutism. But the dissolution of the Ancien Régime in France alarmed all the European royal courts fearing that the French Jacobinism would have spread in the whole continent and provoked deep destabilization inside their own absolutist government systems.;x

EVENTNAME12121;Robespierre and the Reign of Terror;x
EVENTHIST12121;In the National Convention two forces emerged: the Montagnards and the Girondins. Since the beginning of the revolutionary wars, the latter party has been becoming suspected of indulgency for its moderate policies towards the counter-revolutionary forces inside and outside France. On 2 June 1793 an insurrection broke out in Paris obliging the national convention to decree the arrest of all the Girondins. As answer to this a big federalist insurrection led by the remnants of the Gironde party was organized in several provinces of France but it resulted in a complete failure as in a few months it was easily tamed. Since the coup d'état of 2 June, the Montagnard party led by Robespierre no longer faced any strong political opposition to the way they would lead their own radical republican but firmly intransigent domestic policy. Maximilien Robespierre emerged as the leading figure on the Committee of Public Safety. Robespierre was the son and grandson of lawyers from the northern town of Arras. Historians differ in their interpretation of Robespierre. These range from the view that he was a popular democrat who saved the essence of the revolution to one presenting him as the precursor of twentieth-century totalitarianism. In any event, Robespierre crushed the counter-revolution and masterminded the Terror, a period of time during which 'Madame Guillotine' was held warm by the blood of the people.;x

A young artillery lieutenant when the French revolution erupted, he grabbed his first opportunity at the siege of Toulon in 1793 and then become the youngest general in the French revolutionary armies. A military genius, his victories in Italy in 1796 (and again 1800) and his campaign in Egypt 1798 would sharpen his thirst for power and he would become consul, then Emperor, marking the dawn of a new age.;x

EVENTNAME12125;The Napoleonic Wars;x
EVENTHIST12125;Napoléon introduced wide ranging reforms into the territories that he captured from his opponents. He abolished most of the hereditary privileges of the nobility and clergy, reformed land ownership to allow the peasantry real control of their lives, and codified laws so that all citizens would be treated equally under a single set of rationalized laws. He eliminated preferment based on birth from all appointments, by the state or otherwise. These reforms challenged and threated every ancien regime state of Europe, and these states reacted forcefully to contain French ideals.;x

Plans for canals, resovoirs, and bridges were laid, giving Paris her modern water supply. Streets were renumbered, the quays of the Seine reorganized. The Quay d'Orsay, Bourse, the Halle des Vins (a wine trade center), the Louvre (Musée Napoléon), Arc du Carrousel, Vendôme Column, Arc de Triomphe, numerous parks, and the restoration of churches were planned, started, or even completed during Napoléon's reign.

On the night of June 17th, 1798, the Grand Master left his palace and the island, taking with him but a few religious artifacts. The French however did not have a chance to settle down on Malta. Their reckless pillaging resulted in a full-scale uprising in a matter of months. The Maltese, supported by Portuguese and English forces, retook the island. On the 15th of June, 1802, a group of Maltese nobles, led by Marquis Testaferrata, offered the island to the British crown. Soon it proved to be invaluable, serving as a perfect operating base for the English fleet after the declaration of Napoléon's continental blockade.;x

Maximilian had managed to consolidate Habsburg rule and soon gained ground against France when the war recommenced. Since Charles was preparing a campaign in Italy, he admitted that he had lost his right to the dowry and ceded the provinces back to Burgundy in the Treaty of Senlis in 1493.

In the context of the wars of Italy, Spain and England were preparing the invasion of France across the Pyrenees, and Fernando requested guarantees of neutrality from Navarre.

These two were successively merged into the Cisalpine Republic on 29 June 1797 with the capital in Milan. The Cisalpine Republic consisted of roughly the former Duchy of Milan, those portions of the Republic of Venice west of the Adige River, the Duchy of Modena, the Papal Legations, the Piedmontese province of Novara, west of Ticino River and the Valtellina. But The Republic would have dissolved after the defeats of France against the Second Coalition in 1799 occupied by Austro-Russian forces. Only in 1800 in the second Italian campaign after the Battle of Marengo First Consul Napoléon Bonaparte retook the territories which this time were extended to the former Austrian lands of the Veneto and the Papal Legations. In January 1802, the Cisalpine Republic changed its name to Italian Republic with Napoléon Bonaparte as its president.;x

While in the United Duchies a woman could not succeed to the throne herself, succession through a female relative was possible. Hence the husbands of Johann Wilhelm's sisters claimed the inheritance. Duke Albrecht Friedrich of Prussia, married to the oldest sister Marie-Eleonore, had no male heir himself and ceded his claim to the husband of his daughter Anna, Elector Johann Sigismund of Brandenburg. This claim was questioned by the husband of the second sister Anna, Philipp Ludwig of Palatinate-Neuburg, who wanted the inheritance for his son Wolfgang Wilhelm. The Count of Nevers-Rethel, originally a sidebranch of the Cleves ducal dynasty, and the Elector of Saxony considered themselves legitimate heirs by virtue of several treaties, and the Emperor, desiring to expand the Habsburgs' supply base near the rebellious Netherlands,declared both female succession and the treaties invalid and was about to confiscate the United Duchies as a lapsed fief.

Napoléon needed Spanish collaboration to win the war at sea, however Spain, now at peace with England wanted to remain neutral.

EVENTNAME170040;The French King in Naples;x
EVENTHIST170040;The presence of Charles VIII of France in the Kingdom of Naples scared the Italian princes, who had in a certain way permitted the French King to achieve his goal of settling there almost undisturbed. Venice and Florence were worried about a French hegemony in the peninsula. French military presence wasn't limited to Southern Italy but also to villages of Tuscany and the Papal States, which previously surrendered to Charles VIII in his march towards Naples, strategically located to grant the French military supply line. The Pope, who previously granted the French King military access through the Papal territories and consented his stay in Rome, felt in jeopardy as much as to refuse Charles VIII being proclaimed King of Naples. Also King Ferdinand of Aragon couldn't accept the French presence in a Kingdom where he instead, in spite of Alfons V's testament which assigned Naples to the other Trastamara branch, could be the one to have claims there. The position of Naples was also important for the Aragonese trading in the Mediterranean. The Duke of Milan, who decisively affected Charles VIII's decision to settle in Naples, was now alarmed by the presence of French reserve troops deployed in the county of Asti, very close to Milan and at the order of the Duke of Orléans, who had dynastical claims to the Milanese throne. So Venice, Milan, the Pope, Spain and even the Holy Roman Empire (so firmly opposed to the French expansionism in Italy as to join any Anti-French alliance available) consequently formed the Anti-French league in Venice on 31 March 1495. Florence preferred to stay out because of her internal problems caused by Charles VIII's passage and decided to support France instead. Having heard about those arrangements and fearing that the confederates would isolate his army in Italy, Charles VIII decided to return to France for reinforcements leaving his regent in Naples. He had to move his army quickly through the Apennines as to reach the Alps and then safety, but the presence of heavy artilleries and carriages transporting the big loot he accumulated across Italy, slowed his march down. Only at Fornovo on the Taro River, in the Po Valley, Charles VIII finally faced the army of the confederates. Despite having lost all the carriages, he managed to reach the Alps gaining from his expedition to Italy nothing but his army decimated by epidemies.;x

EVENTHIST170045;The French military campaign in Italy was at its low in 1513, Louis XII's attempt to recover Milan from the Swiss occupation turned to be a complete defeat with the routing French troops pursued by the Swiss into French territory. In order to recover international prestige, Louis XII had to recognize the Pope as the only chief of the Church and to abandon the schismatic council he established at Pisa and managed to make peace with England, with which he was at war, just before his death occurred early in 1515. His successor and nephew, François Ier of Valois Angoulême, self proclaiming 'duke of Milan' once on the throne of France, made clear to be intentioned to pursue what his uncle Louis XII had miserably failed, the conquest of Milan. Eager to seek revenge on the Swiss troops who routed the French army at Novara and profaned the Gaston de Foix's burial place in the Milanese Duomo, he assembled a big army and quickly moved to Italy through the unknown Col de l'Argentière so to avoid the practical Alpine passes already held by Swiss troops. The unexpected arrival of the French troops on an alternative road surprised the Swiss troops who preferred to fall back to Milan and wait for reinforcements. The way to Milan was clear but in order to avoid the necessity of besieging Milan itself, François Ier offered the Swiss a large sum to retire into their own country. Not having received their subsidies from the Pope and the King of Spain, the Swiss were about to accept his offer when a fresh corps of mercenaries descended into Italy. The French took position at Marignano (today's Melegnano) to face the attacking Swiss and there, in the evening of 13 and in the morning of 14 September 1515, a fierce battle, also known as the Battle of the Giants, was fought. In that battle, paused only at late night of the first day (during which the two armies stand facing each other awaiting the coming day and even François Ier and his gendarmes, forming the advanced line of the French army, remained all night mounted with lance in hand and helmet on head) and then resumed at sunrise of the day after, the French army supported also by Venetian troops managed to defeat the most celebrated Swiss pikemen, who until then were always victorious on the battlefield. When all was over, François Ier, who had fought throughout with gallant spirit and valour, requested the honour of knighthood from the noble Bayard. The city of Milan, abandoned by its Swiss protectors, easily fell under the French troops.;x

EVENTHIST170048;On 28 June 1519 after the death of his grand-father, the Emperor Maximilian I of Habsburg, Charles, King of Spain and Duke of Burgundy, became Holy Roman Emperor thanks to the money of his bankers (Fuggers and Welsers mainly) in a very expensive struggle with François Ier King of France. Having proclaimed himself as the only legitimate heir of Charlemagne, the first Emperor of Frankish dynasty, François Ier had announced his candidature to the imperial election. As a matter of facts all the electors were heavily bribed in order to obtain the much desired vote, and that was standard practice at those times. Charles 'bought' the Imperial title paying the Great Electors and their emissaries the huge sum of 850,000 golden florins (equal to a value of Kg 2,100 of gold). That money came mainly from the Castilian rents as the New World still didn't provide with much income. Charles's election was also eased by the Army of the Svevian league, which impressed the doubtful electors when chasing the Duke of Wirtemberg, chief of the pro-French party, out of his duchy. That denied the last remote chance for François to win the election. Being elected Holy Roman Emperor as Charles V, Charles (Karl in the German world or Carlos in Spain) of the House of Habsburg obtained the rights of suzerainty over all the fiefs in the Holy Roman Empire. Amongst them the Duchy of Milan together with its sovereignty of the Republic of Genoa represented an important junction in the Habsburg's dominions, the socalled 'Spanish road'. As a result of this election, France found herself dangerously surrounded by the Habsburg might from the South with Spain, from the East with Northern Italy and Franche-Comté from the North with the Low Countries.;x

EVENTHIST170049;In 1530 during the congress of Bologna Pope Clement VII consecrated Charles V Holy Roman Emperor and convinced him to forgive the misbehaviour of Francesco II Sforza who joined the League of Cognac, as the Pope himself did. The Pope managed to have the Emperor grant Sforza the ducal title on the throne of Milan again, but under the firm condition that, on Sforza's death, the Duchy would have returned definitely to the Empire. A marriage was also agreed between Sforza and Charles V's niece Christine of Denmark. On 2 November 1535 Duke Francesco II died childless and, according to previous agreements made during the Congress of Bologna in 1530, the Duchy of Milan reverted to the Empire. As suzerain of those fiefs, Charles V had it administrated by means of life-governors whom he himself appointed. The Emperor's decision strongly displeased François Ier of France, whose younger son Charles, in possession of the title of Duke of Orléans and thus with dynastical claims to the Milanese throne, had his candidature rejected, in spite of his assurances of allegiance to the Empire. The King of France would have planned a new military campaign in Italy against Charles V, this time with the help of the Turk. At first the French King attacked Savoy, whose Duke Charles III refused him the military access through his possessions, and annexed the duchy with the assertion he had a dynastical claim to it: his mother was Luise de Savoie, daughter of Philippe II Duke de Savoie and step-sister of Charles III.;x

The main purposes of this alliance, stipulated in disguise of a trade agreement, was the planned combined attack to the Empire from two opposite fronts and the use of the Turkish galleys led by Kair-ed-din Barbarossa to engage the enemy's fleet and to raid the coastal villages of Italy and Spain. The alliance that had been under discussion since 1525 was preliminarily agreed in February 1535 and formalized in February 1536 between French ambassador Laforest and Grand Vizier Ibrahim. The treaty also granted the French commercial concessions in the Ottoman Empire replacing Venice, as well as conceded the so called capitulations which also allowed French consuls legal jurisdiction over French subjects in Ottoman domains and recognized the French King as protector of the Christian holy places in Palestine, concessions that would have long-term effects on Ottoman relations with other foreign powers as well as internal development.

By the treaty with England on April 11, 1713, Louis recognized the Hanover rule in England and confirmed the renunciation of Felipe's claims to the French throne. Hudson Bay territory, Acadia, St. Kitts and Newfoundland were ceded, and the demolition the fortress of Dunkirk agreed. The same day France agreed that the United Provinces should annex part of Guelders, and will keep the Spanish Netherlands in deposit for Charles VI Habsburg. He also recognized the King of Prussia, and acknowledged the right of the Duke of Savoy to the Kingdom of Sicily and to Nice. To Portugal, a small part of the Guiana was ceded. The peace with Charles VI will have to wait to the treaties of Rastatt (March 6, 1714) and Baden (September 7, 1714), acknowledging his right to the Spanish Netherlands, Milan, Naples and Sardinia, and restoring the left bank of the Rhine to the Empire.

Brought to severe famine the citizenship of Milan was forced to surrender to the condottiero and accept him as their new Duke. As soon as Sforza proclaimed himself successor of Visconti to the throne of Milan and the Holy Roman Emperor didn't acknowledge him the ducal investiture, the war of succession inevitably began.

King Louis XI of France seized the opportunity provided with his rival's defeat and death to take possession of the duchy of Burgundy and also of Franche-Comté, Picardie and Artois. He justified his military intervention with the fact that these lands had always been fiefs to the French crown and that with Charles' death, the last member of the French Valois dynasty they had 'de facto', and according to the salic law, to be reverted to France. But the choice of which prince should marry the duchess would be of particular importance for the future political and economical stability of Western Europe, so he urged Mary to accept his son, the Dauphin Charles, as husband, in order to secure the inheritance of the Low Countries for his descendants too, even by force of arms if necessary.;x

So, Louis XV decided to undertake vast reforms in the arsenals. He passed an ordinance on September 28 1748 that abolished the sentence, although not definitively. This ordinance attached by the same occasion the body of the galleys to the Royal Navy. So harsh were the living conditions and corporal punishments on board, that a sentence to serve on the galleys was like a death sentence. Moreover, as the wars of Louis XV came to an end, the Navy required fewer crews: now, prisonners convicted to forced labour were sent in majority to the convict prison and were employed as a cheap workforce by the Admiralty. Following this ordinance, the convict prisons of Toulon and Brest borned since 1748, then, Rochefort in 1776. The galleys were progressively replaced by the frigates, which were quite superior.;x

EVENTNAME170066;The liberalization of the trade for the grain;x
EVENTHIST170066;The Prime Minister of Louis XV, Choiseul, decided in July 1764, to liberalize the trade of the grain which was previously severely controlled by the state. The French economy was at this time in full rise and the important harvests as well as the low prices in the years 1760 to 1763 encouraged with optimism. Unfortunately, the harvest of 1764 was very bad and the strong speculation permitted by the liberalization of the market of the grains involved a grain shortage. In a lot of cities, spontaneous revolts begun, leading to a great disorder in the Kingdom.;x

EVENTNAME170067;Damiens' torture;x
EVENTHIST170067;From the 1750s, the Parlements begun to practise a policy of systematic obstruction against all royal measurements, while Louis XV, fearful, did not find the energy to manage the reforms which were essential. However, in December 1756, the King decided to put an end to the rebellion of the magistrates and succeeded in making record by the Parlements the edicts restricting a part of their capacities but this united the people against him. In January 1757, during the Seven Year War, Robert-François Damiens tried to murder the King in the gardens of Versailles with a knife but Louis XV was only slightly wounded at the shoulder. Slightly disturbed, Damiens wanted to force Louis XV to reconcile with his people. The entourage of the King and especially Mrs. de Pompadour, made pressure on the Parlement in order that his gesture was interpreted like a regicide. In spite of the anger of the people which protested against this judgement, Damiens would be condemned to the one of the most dreadful torments of all the History. He was initially attached during 57 days on a rack mattress. Then he was condemned to the fire torment. Arms and legs were burnt by red-hot pincers and lead melted was put on the wounds. Then, he undergone quartering during more than two hours, but being very robust, the members did not give way and the exhausted horses should be changed. To put an end to the torture, the executioner approached and quickly cut the tendons, which made fall the four members. All that remained of Damiens when it was thrown to the woodshed was only one trunk whose chest breathed and whose lips still moved... The torment of Damiens, of an age not being one of the Enlightment, did nothing but reinforce the parliamentary protests, which did not fail to underline the disproportionate characteristic of this sentence. Louis XV, the 'Beloved', was not it any more and had definitively lost the favours of his people.;x

EVENTNAME170068;The expulsion of the Jesuits;x
EVENTHIST170068;The Parlement of Paris, composed in a vast majority of gallicans, had always been a keen opposant of the Jesuits and had on this subject the tacit support of the Prime Minister Choiseul. In 1761, the Parlement had finally the possibility of making pressure on Louis XV to banish the Society of Jesus from France. The occasion was given by the trial of the father La Valette. This Jesuit had made bad business in the Antilla. Its creditors bring an action against the Society which was condemned to refund them. Taking advantages of the trial, the Parlement of Paris examined the constitution of the Society, declared it in opposition to the laws of the Kingdom and concluded that the Company was to be dissolved in France. The Jesuits could remain in the Kingdom only by way of simple priests, directly submitted to the bishops. After two years of resistance, the King agreed. The Society of Jesus was abolished in France in November 1764. The other sovereigns of the Bourbon dynasty, from Spain, Parma, and Two-Sicilies followed this example and those from Portugal which had preceded it. Then, all of them agreed with Louis XV to demand to the Pope the abolition of the Society in the entire catholic world in 1773. The Society of Jesus was reconstituted only at the beginning of the XIXth century. The victory of the Parlement over the Jesuits was accompanied by a recrudescence of the fanaticism from the magistrates who were opposed to the Enlightenment while fighting against the Protestants. Many examples of intolerance followed: the hanging of the pastor Rochette who had preached in spite of the law, the torment of the Protestant Jean Calas accused to have killed his son to prevent it from converting to Catholicism or the execution of the young knight de la Barre for practices sacrileges...;x

EVENTNAME170069;The Beast of Gevaudan;x
EVENTHIST170069;Between June 30, 1764 and June 19, 1767, 104 murders were perpetrated in the province of Gevaudan in the southern Auvergne. All the victims were women or children, but no adult man was attacked. All the accounts of the eyewitnesses of the attacks described an animal looking like a wolf. But the wounds, extremely unusual, such as the size of the bites as well as decapitations, couldn't be made by a wolf but only by a 'beast'. In front of the extent of the massacre and the inefficiency of the local lords, the peasants called upon Louis XV. He, touched by their misfortunes, sent a regiment of dragoons commanded by the captain Duhamel to solve the problem. Despite several beats and the massacre of hundreds of wolves, the attacks didn't stop. Louis XV even had to send his personal gun carrier, François Antoine de Beauterne, who does not succeed in doing better than Duhamel. This story had unpleasant consequences on the reign of Louis XV. Not only the peasants always remained under the threat of the 'beast', but became exhausted by the many hunts without being able to plough their fields. Moreover, by the failure of Duhamel and Beauterne, Louis XV became the laughing stock of the other monarchs, especially in England, and the secretly published newspapers tackled its authority severely. The affair fascinated all the French and became one fo the main subject of conversation during two years.;x

EVENTNAME170070;The capture of the Beast of Gevaudan;x
EVENTHIST170070;Three years after the beginning of the murders in Gevaudan by the 'beast', none of the hunts lead by Duhamel and Beauterne gave satisfaction, despite the capture of several large wolves. The local population was defended by itself and the majority of the men only moved armed. After a last victim on June 17, 1767, a poacher named Jean Chastel succeeds on June 19 in killing an extraordinary wolf by his size and his proportions, very different from the common wolves. Some described the killed 'beast' as a large mastiff with long bristling furs and a broad breast. After that, no more attack nor murder was recorded in the area. The affair stopped but remained unsolved since nothing proved that the Chastel's wolf was the 'beast'. Nowadays, it remains some shades on this story, especially such as certain female victims discovered were stripped, the heads of some bodies were carried by the 'beast' (what no animal does) and the 'beast' didn't attack adult men. Several hypothesis were evoked since the 18th century to explain it: giant wolf, tiger, hyena, fantastic animal like a bear crossbred with a monkey, werewolf or even, a serial-killer. The selected hypothesis today is that it was probably a cross between a wolf and a Neapolitan mastiff and this 'beast' was trained to attack by someone who could be Jean Chastel himself. But nothing is truly proven...;x

EVENTNAME170071;The Parlements;x
EVENTHIST170071;The Parlements had been formed in the Middle Age in order to apply the laws and justice. They were present in Paris and in a dozen of provincial capitals. Its members were owners of their office often from father to son. During many conflicts with the royal government, they had little by little acquired the right to check the laws. Louis XIV had reduced their power by removing the right of remonstrance but the regency of Philippe of Orleans would return to them. They had thus became some politics bodies impossible to circumvent which were frequently opposed to the royal power. In May 1765, the Parlement of Rennes opposed to the duke d'Aiguillon, military governor of Brittany, which wished to rise an additional tax, and resigned in block. The King then arrested the leaders and forced the Parlement to obedience. The Parlement of Paris then joined the Parlement of Rennes in the dispute and resigned in block too. The King recalled to all the Parlements that they owed him obedience and that there was only one monarch. But this act of authority of the King was without a future and d'Aiguillon resigned in 1768.;x

EVENTHIST170072;In December 1770, Louis XV dismissed his Prime Minister, Choiseul, under the pressure of his favorite of the moment, the countess du Barry. He would be replaced by a triumvirate made up of the duke d'Aiguillon to the Foreign Affairs, of the abbot Terray to the Finances and René Nicolas de Maupeou with justice. The King was at this time in conflict, once more, with the Parlements of Rennes which was opposing to the duke d'Aiguillon and with the Parlement of Paris which made public reproach with the King of its support to the duke. The crisis with the members of Parlement was accentuated when in January 1771, the Parlement of Paris refused to be in session in order to ratify the royal decisions. Maupeou then convinced the King to act. January 20, Louis XV sent his musketeers to the residence of the recalcitrant and exiled them to the province, without taking account of the protests of the public opinion, the middle-class and even of the princes of blood (his own family), by ignoring absolutely the pamphlets from Beaumarchais. Decided to give back to the royalty its power, Maupeou formed a new Parlement with more flexible magistrates and removed the venality of the offices and introduced the equality of all the subjects in front of the justice.

EVENTNAME170074;L'encyclopédie;x
EVENTHIST170074;Encyclopedias date back to 2nd-century Rome. But Ephraim Chambers's English encyclopedia broke new ground in 1728. Its title, typical of the time, sounds more like a table of contents: 'Cyclopaedia: or a Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences, Containing an Explication of the Terms ... in the Several Arts, both Liberal and Mechanical ... etc., etc. ... '.\n The new idea here is mechanical arts. Earlier encylopedias were never that down-to-earth. The French arranged to publish Chambers's encyclopedia in 1745.\n But, after a fight with the English translator, they decided to develop a greatly expanded French version instead. By 1747, Denis Diderot had assumed leadership of the project -- except for mathematical parts, which were handled by the mathematician d'Alembert.\n Diderot added real fire to the project. He was briefly jailed in 1749 for his liberal views, and when the first two volumes were published in 1751, he was attacked by Jesuit authorities.\n The problem was that Diderot and the other writers were rationalists. The work was now titled Encyclopedia, or a Systematic Dictionary of Science, Arts, and the Trades, and it was on its way to becoming a 28-volume treatise on human affairs.\n The Dictionnaire, as it was called, laid bare the workings of the known world in a way no one had ever tried to do. It boldly told the average man that he could know what only Kings, emperors, and their lieutenants were supposed to know.\n It suggested that anyone should have access to rational truth. In that sense it was a profoundly revolutionary document.;x

He attempted to weigh or 'assay' his nature, habits, his own opinions and those of others. He is searching for truth by reflecting on his readings, his travels as well as his experiences both public and private.\n The Renaissance was also a period of expanding horizons, and one in which there was a vast increase in knowledge of the world and its inhabitants. At the same time Europeans were recovering Latin culture and a much more complete grasp of Greek literature, Science was developing.\n New horizons made previous truths seem wrong or parochial. These discoveries provided Montaigne and other skeptics with a treasure chest of new facts which they used to increase our sense of relativity of all man's beliefs about himself and the world in which he lives.;x

The man chosen was Armand Jean du Plessis de Richelieu, an advocate of centralized state power and a favourite of Louis XIII. In a first time, Richelieu rallied with Marie de Medici' when she was regent and was Secretary of State at the Interior and at the War but was banned from his bishopric when Louis took the power and the assassination of Concini. His appointment was opposed by the nobles who wanted a more conservative Cardinal. However, it was his appointment to the royal council which provoked the most violent opposition in 1624.

She placed her trust in Concino Conini, who was appointed Prime Minister, and in his wife, Leonora Galigaï, two intriguers who came from Florence as she did.

At the same time, the prince of Condé, in the name of the nobility, asked for the convocation of the General Estates. The regent, overwhelmed and whom the power was not assured, preferred to negotiate with the nobles. Thus, the treaty of Sainte Ménéhould was signed on May 14, 1614 in which Marie de' Medici bought the Greats of the Kingdom with the money of the Florentine bankers: 450.000 ecus were given to Condé, 300.000 to the duke of Mayenne, 100.000 to the duke of Longueville, Brittany to the duke of Vendôme, Mézières to the duke of Nevers like several other estates to the other nobles...;x

Concino Concini, with his wife, Leonora Galigaï, had great influence over the mother of the King, Marie de' Medici, who made him Marquis d'Ancre and Field Marshal, without ever having fought. Soon he brought down the hostility of the great nobles on himself. In April 24, 1617, Concini was assassinated by the Marquis of Vitry on the order of Louis XIII in the court of the Louvre. After his assassination, his wife, accused as a witch, was executed in July 8. The same day as the assassination of Concini, Louis XIII fired the ministers of the Concini, among whom was the Bishop of Luçon, future Cardinal Richelieu. On the order of the King, May 3, 1617, the Queen-Mother was put under house arrest in Blois, while the Bishop of Luçon was exiled in Avignon (April 7, 1618).

The rebel forces met the royal armies led by Louis XIII himself at Ponts-de-Cé on August 7, 1620, where they were fully destroyed. With the advice of the bishop of Luçon (Richelieu) and from fear of seeing his mother continuing to plot, the King accepted his return to the court of France.

EVENTHIST170089;The Prime Minister of Louis XIII, Richelieu, was a man hated by the nobility because he reduced the privileges of this nobility. He particularly forbid the duels, favored the local middle-class or the recently established nobility of the merchants, and destroyed several fortresses owned by the Greats. In 1626, Louis XIII wished that his brother, Gaston, then heir of the Kingdom, marries one of the most beautiful matches of France, Marie de Bourbon, princess of Montpensier. The purpose of this marriage was to control the order of succession as Louis didn't have a direct heir. This marriage had been thought of by Richelieu. Thus, various interests of the nobles and all the hatreds against Richelieu gathered around Gaston, so a party 'of the aversion to the marriage' was born. The duchess of Chevreuse, the Queen, Marie de' Médici and the half-brothers of the King, the princes de Vendôme, pressed Gaston to leave the court and rebel against the King. The lover of the duchess of Chevreuse, the count de Chalais was supposed to assassinate Richelieu by claiming a quarrel. Because of internal dissensions, the plot was quickly discovered. The King and Richelieu immediately reacted and arrested the conspirators. The princes de Vendôme were imprisoned, the duchess of Chevreuse exiled in Lorraine, and Gaston had to yield to the will of the King and marry Marie de Bourbon nevertheless, gaining the duchy of Orleans. Only the count de Chalais was executed by decapitation, because he was the only participant not to belong to the royal family or to its entourage. Although not very serious, this conspiracy showed the increasing opposition of the nobles to the policy of Richelieu.;x

Several nobles, upset to see Richelieu cut down gradually their privileges, supported Gaston. Among them was the duke of Lorraine and the duke of Montmorency, whose cousin had been executed on order of Richelieu and the King for having gone against the law on the duels three years before. The duke of Montmorency, then governor of Languedoc, stirred up the province against the King and Richelieu with the help of Gaston of Orleans. The troops of Montmorency were defeated in Castelnaudary on September 1, 1632 by the marshal of Schomberg. Montmorency was captured, sentenced to death and decapitated on the orders of Richelieu in Toulouse on October 30, 1632.

EVENTHIST170091;Of all the revolts which regularly disturbed the ministry of the cardinal of Richelieu, that of the count de Soissons was probably the most dangerous because its failure was only due to the hazard of the war. This plot was supported by the duke of Bouillon, a great leader and prince of Sedan, by money and troops from the King of Spain and by Gaston of Orléans, the brother of the King. The duke of Bouillon and the count de Soissons raised troops and accepted the support of Spain, then invaded France. The plan of the conspirators envisaged to assassinate the cardinal and to incite the rebellion among the people of Paris. As soon as the Spanish army joined the forces of the conspirators, they engaged the troops of the King in battle near the Marfée. They gained a complete victory, crushing the royal army, but the death of the count of Soissons, killed in the battle by a shot in the head, made the victory useless to the ones who were dissatisfied. We don't truly know how the count of Soissons died, if he was killed by a sniper or if, more probably, he died of his own blunder, having the bad habits to raise his visor with the barrel of his gun. The duke of Bouillon submitted himself soon after to the King and kept the town of Sedan.

EVENTHIST170092;The marquis of Cinq-Mars quickly became the King's favorite thanks to the support of Richelieu and, although from modest nobility, accepted the rank of great equerry for which he was called 'Monsieur le Grand'. His influence on the King was great, almost as much as Richelieu's. He hoped to reinforce his position at the court by marrying the richest heiress of the time, Marie of Gonzague, but her being adverse an opponent of Richelieu, the cardinal vetoed such an alliance. The marquis of Cinq-Mars was extremely heinous against Richelieu. He was then approached by several important nobles who couldn't bear any more Richelieu gradually depriving them of their rights and privileges. Thus a conspiracy was born with purpose of getting of Richelieu and joined together the duke of Orleans (the brother of the King), the Queen, Anne Austria, the marquis of Frontailles and the duke of Bouillon. They requested the help of Spain in war with France since 1635 and signed a treaty where Philippe IV provided the conspirators with 120.00 infantrymen, 6.000 cavalry and 400.000 ecus in exchange for a peace treaty where each one returned the conquered cities and where France gave its Swedish and German alliances up. The conspirators even envisaged to assassinate Richelieu. Nobody knows with certainty who betrayed the conspirators, but it was probably the Queen, Anne of Austria, who sought to protect her son, the future Louis XIV. On 12 June, informed of this plot, Richelieu warned the King who gave the order to arrest the traitors. Cinq-Mars was arrested as well as the brother of the King, the marquis of Frontailles fled abroad while the duke of Bouillon, trying to escape, was found in a barn full of hay.

EVENTHIST170093;On January 28, 1635, Richelieu signed the letters of licence which created a new institution: the French Academy. The cardinal was named ' father and protector' academy which counted 40 elected members at life (from where the ironic nickname of 'immortals' to the members). The institution had, and still has nowadays, for goal to give to the French language precise rules, to make it pure and comprehensible by all. The first task of the French Academy was to write a dictionary of which the first edition will be published in 1694. But the Academy had also the role of patron through the many literary prices which it organized. For Richelieu, it was a method of control on all the intellectual meetings, to attach the men of letters and to put them at the service of the state and the royal power.;x

EVENTNAME170094;The Michau code;x
EVENTHIST170094;The Michau code was called from Michel of Marillac who was Minister of Justice under Louis XIII. He wrote, at the request of Richelieu, an ordinance which compiled all the reforms begun by the General Estates and the various Parlements since 1614 and which was a synthesis of more than four hundred texts of laws. Marillac fell in disgrace after the Day of Dupes but its code remained in application. The laws included in the code touched all the fields of the public life: policy, legal, economic and military. Among the most important applications of these laws, we can note the authorization granted to the nobles to practise the trade without strip of, which allowed, with the application of commercial taxes on the foreign merchants, to favour the French trade. In order to protect this trade, the code proposed the creation of a permanent war navy of dedicated to the protection of the sea trade ways. The taxation was also re-examined by a reform of the collection of the taxes and the reduced way of life of the court. In order to reduce the expenditure, several useless fortresses were destroyed. But on the other hand, the military expenditure was increased and a military regulation payment fixed the pays according to the rank and the conditions of quartering of the soldiers. The code allowed also the ennoblement of the commoners, which caused a social upheaval. Another aspect of the code was the reinforcement of the laws allowing the control of publishing books and printing works, allowing to the King a more thorough censorship. The code also prohibited constitution in association or league to the subjects of the King. This code set up the foundations for a strong and centralized state whose Louis XIV was going to push the expression to the maximum...;x

EVENTNAME170095;The Commune of Paris;x
EVENTHIST170095;The experiment of a 'constitutional monarchy' (legislative power given to a people's assembly and executive power to the King and his ministers) was heavily endangered when King Louis XVI vetoed the proposal of the girondine government in charge to reinforce military defenses in Paris against inside and outside enemies and formed a new government calling back the Feuillants, which were openly supporting the monarchy. The reaction of the citizenship of Paris was to storm the Tuileries (the new King's royal court since the people of Paris struck by famine stormed Versailles in October 1789) to have the King confirm former government. But the final struck to the monarchy was given by the proclamation of the Duke of Brunswick, a Prussian army leader opposed to a revolutionary France, who threatened to destroy the city of Paris in case anyone would attempt on the King's life again. As result of this the people of Paris had the city council deposed and established 'La Commune insurrectionnelle de Paris' with extreme radical republican attitudes and stormed the Tuileries for a second time as to have the King house-arrested and definitively suspended from his powers. Under those popular pressures the legislative assembly was forced to call for another election to form a new assembly, the National Convention, which would have worked at the draft of a new and more democratic and egalitarian constitution.;x

EVENTHIST170097;As the French revolution dragged on and saw permanent turmoil and the outburst of war, the people of the western province of France (Poitou, Vendée, Brittany) came to regret the old regime and its relative stability, if not liberty. The unwise move of the Republican government to suppress the old clergy replacing the catholic cult and the announcement of a general call-up (la levée en masse), combined with the return of some Royalist nobles and the support of 'refractory' priests, were the sparks that ignited terrible peasant revolts in march 1793 that would force the diversion of large number of troops and mass massacres in the so called Chouan Revolts (Chouanneries) and the Wars of the Vendée.;x

EVENTHIST170098;The Directory was the French revolutionary government set up by the Constitution of the Year III, which lasted four years, from November 1795 to November 1799. The Directors chose governmental ministers, ambassadors, army generals, tax collectors, and other officials. However, they had no funds to finance their projects or courts to enforce their will. The Directory was perhaps the most corrupt regime that France has ever known. Its policies were aimed, first, at protecting and increasing the profits of those in political and economic power and, second, at preventing the return of the Bourbons or the establishment of any other regime that might endanger those in power by such means as the redistribution of national property. The period was also noted for extravagant fashions in dress, excesses in entertainment, and a loose morality.;x
#;x
EVENTNAME170099;The Pacification of the Vendée;x
EVENTHIST170099;Since March 1793 those spontaneous and uncoordinated riots of peasants in Vendée, also supported by local nobles and refractory priests, organized themselves in a 'Royal and Catholic Army' against which the inadequately equipped Republican forces were being easily routed. The Convention took measures against the emigrés and the refractory priests and on 19 March 1793 it was decreed that every person accused of taking part in the counter-revolutionary revolts, or of wearing the white cockade was to be declared as an outlaw and commissions were sent to where the municipalities needed to be purged. But these measures proved to be insufficient as the successes of the Vendeans, coordinated with the Chouans, still continued in the 'bocages', whose knowledge gave the local rebels immense advantage. The defeats sustained by the Vandéans at Cholet and Savenay put definitely at end the regular warfare but not the massacres upon the civilians which were perpetrated by the republican forces in the rebelling departments. From January to July 1794 'Infernal columns' were formed and sent into Vendée under the command of Tourreau with the Directory's formal order to 'exterminate this rebellious race of Vendéans, to make their abodes disappear, to torch their forests, to cut their crops'. Things went better after the changes of 9 Thermidor when the Convention allowed liberty of worship to the Vendeans and limitations to their conscriptions. In July 1795 a new 'emigrés' expedition was attempted in the landing at Quiberon with the support of Chouans and of some remnants of Vendéan troops, however it ended in complete failure with the death of the last two 'White' chiefs. Only after July 1796 the 'troubles in the West were definitively appeased' and the state of siege was eventually lifted. It was esteemed that in 1793-1796 at least about 120,000 out of a population of around 815,000 died in the 'genocide' of the Vendéens.;x

EVENTNAME170100;For all nations in all times;x
EVENTHIST170100;On may 8, 1790, following a motion by Talleyrand, the National Assembly decided on the creation of a decimal system of measurement units that would keep stable, unvarying and simple. The first unit chosen was based on a pendulum beating a second. On March 30, 1791, after a proposal by the Académie des Sciences, the Assembly finally chose that a metre would be a 1/10 000 000 of the distance between the north pole and the equator. On April 7, 1795 (18 Germinal year III) the Convention decreed that the new 'Republican Measures' were to be henceforth legal measures in France. The motto 'for all nations in all times' was adopted for the new system. This was the Decimal Metric System, which proved to be simple to use, and making measure transitions between different dimensions easier beyond compare. The metric system has survived practically unchanged as the basis of today's International System of Units.;x

EVENTHIST170101;Upon the death of Henry II, the Guises collected the new King, François II, and their niece, Mary Stuart, now Queen of France and moved them from Château des Tournelles to the Louvre. Catherine de Medicis decided not to risk staying with her dead husband's body, and followed the 15 year old King, so as to ensure her position on the new royal council of France. Without bloodshed, the Guise family had taken control of the government. Unfortunately, many in the Kingdom were unhappy with the regime change.;x

EVENTHIST170102;While the Guises brothers had gained control of the government, the Bourbons as princes of the blood had the better claim to direct France's affairs during the royal minority. Staunch Catholics, the Guises intensified the persecution of Protestants begun during the reign of Henry II. The combination of both grievances produced a Bourbon conspiracy against the Guises. Louis, prince of Conde, the younger brother of Anthony King of Navarre, launched a plan to kidnap Francis II, remove him from the clutches of the Guises, and take vengeance on the upstarts. The attempted coup, launched while the young King was at the royal hunting lodge of Amboise, was foiled: some of the conspirators were killed, and relations between these powerful families, already poisonous, took on the character of a blood-feud. Surprisingly, Catherine de Medici was able to insist on a moderate reaction to the conspiracy, but it is quite possible that a more severe response might have resulted in civil war.;x

EVENTHIST170103;Although the regent Catherine de Medici preferred to pursue a conciliatory policy with the Huguenot Calvinists, even issuing an edict in April 1561 offering them toleration for private religious observances, for many Catholics the Queen-Mother's policy was utterly unacceptable. On March 1 1562, the crisis came to a head. While returning from an embassy in Germany, the duke of Guise and his entourage passed through the village of Vassy. Violence errupted between Guise's men and Huguenots who were at worship there. While the casualties were heavy on both sides, for Huguenots throughout France the 'massacre' was proof of a Catholic conspiracy to destroy them, and within a month the prince of Conde and his Huguenot followers seized Orleans and began to arm themselves. Catherine hoped for a peaceful resolution and thus commanded the governor of Paris to order both Conde and Guise out of the city. Guise who had been hailed as a hero in Paris, knew his position was secure and stayed put. Conde rightfully fearing for his life, fled the city to meet up with Coligny. War was inevitable.;x

Having been forced into the arms of the Guise faction, Catherine de Medici's reluctant sanction gave the Guise Catholic faction the aura of legitimacy, but for the prince of Conde and his Huguenot followers Catherine's support for Guise relieved them of any moral obligation toward the Crown.

EVENTHIST170105;On 18 February 1563 Francis duke of Guise was returning from a camp inspection when he was shot three times in the shoulder: he died a few days later. His assassin was Poltrot de Mere, a Huguenot gentleman from Saintoigne, who under torture implicated the Admiral de Coligny and other Protestant leaders. Though Coligny denied any involvement in the crime, and though a royal inquiry formally cleared him of the charge, the Guise family always believed in the Admiral's guilt and looked for revenge. In the long term, however, the assassination meant that the Guises could count on the support of all those Frenchmen for whom the murdered duke had been a national hero, the defender of Metz in 1552 and the conqueror of Calais in 1558, and the champion of the Catholic faith since. There is no doubt that the shots fired by Poltrot de Mere gravely exacerbated the civil divisions in France and added a new note of brutality to the conflict between Catholic and Huguenot.;x

Unable to solve the intractable problem of the Huguenots by force, the new King tried conciliation by issuing the Edict of Beaulieu, better known as the Peace of Monsieur because contemporaries assumed it had been forced on the King by the duke of Alencon (who, as the King's younger brother, was referred to as Monsieur). For the first time in the religious wars Huguenots were allowed free and public exercise of their religion, and eight fortified towns were placed under Huguenot control. However, the peace caused widespread indignation among Catholics, who viewed it as royal capitulation to the Huguenots. Some of them decided to oppose its implementation and to set up defensive leagues, similar in structure to the Huguenot 'state-within-a-state' in existence since the early 1560s. Instead of peace, Henri's policy led to more warfare, and in place of one grave threat to the French monarchy, created two.;x

Henri III had no son and was unlikely ever to have one. This left Henri of Navarre as heir, thereby raising the spectre that the next King of France might be a heretic. In September 1584 Henri duke of Guise and his brothers the duke of Mayenne and the Cardinal of Guise met at Nancy and founded league to keep Navarre off the throne. Philip II signed a treaty with the new League, and military operations began at once.

EVENTHIST170110;In May 1588, the Wars of Religion in France entered its final chapter. The people of Paris, under the influence of the League preachers, were becoming dissatisfied with Henri III and his failure to suppress the Protestants. To be a moderate Catholic was almost as bad as being a heretic to the Leaguers and a popular uprising on the streets of Paris caused Henri III to flee the city. The Catholic League took complete control of the government, welcomed Guise to the city and pressed for a meeting of the Estates-General where they could propose the Cardinal de Bourbon as heir to the crown. There was even a fear that Henri III would be forced to abdicate and that the people might proclaim Guise King. On Christmas Eve in 1588, when Guise was at Blois for the meetings, Henri III invited him to his quarters for some discussion. When he entered, the doors were bolted and although he struggled heroically, he was killed. The same fate was visited on his brother, the Cardinal de Guise. But the younger brother, the Duc of Mayenne, remained alive and became the new leader of the League. Enraged by the treachery of the King, formerly moderate towns rushed to join the League.;x

Ambroise Paré gave his most significant contributions to amputation surgery and prosthetics sciences. He reintroduced the use of linen ligatures when he ran out of cautery oil during battle surgery. Time was still a limiting factor: a surgeon working with no anesthesia, tourniquet, or skilled aid hand was limited to about 30 seconds to amputate and 3 minutes to complete the operation. This is a very small amount of time for a surgeon to ligate major arteries and is why many, such as Guillemeau, Paré's student, again abandoned this method for direct cautery.;x

EVENTNAME170134;The Purchase of the Somme Towns;x
EVENTHIST170134;Under the terms of the treaty signed so long ago between Charles VII and the Duke of Burgundy, the Crown reserved the right to purchase back the Somme territories for a sum that no one had believed the Crown could ever afford. As a result, it was to Duke Philip's great surprise when King Louis XI requested the territories back at the exorbitant sum of 400,000 ecus. Through forced loans, special taxes, and impositions on towns and monestaries, Louis would pay merely half of the sum from his own pocket.;x

EVENTNAME170135;The War of the Public Weal;x
EVENTHIST170135;During the early years of his reign, King Louis XI had done much to antagonize the great magnates of France in his attempts to centralize the monarchy. A steady stream of dissenters flowed to a group of nobles who would form a League against Louis. The principle members were the Duke of Alencon, the Count of Dunois, Charles 'the Bold' Count of Charolais, the Count of Saint-Pol, the Duke of Brittany, Charles II of Albret, John Duke of Lorraine and Calabria and Jacques d'Armagnac, Duke of Nemours, among others. The revolt was signaled when Louis' brother, Charles, Duke of Berry, fled to the court of the Duke of Brittany. Soon afterwards, the Duke of Bourbon marched against the King. Burgundy and Brittany followed suit within a short time.;x

EVENTHIST170136;King Louis XI subdued Bourbon first. The Duke's subjugation was followed by a hasty truce which he was quick to violate. Meanwhile, Charles, Count of Charolais and son of Philippe, Duke of Burgundy, had marched to capture several of the Somme towns and several towns and territories ceded to Jean, Count of Etampes and Nevers by Philippe Duke of Burgundy, including Peronne, Roye, and Montdidier. Royal troops led by Louis met Charles's Burgundian army at Montlhery. The resulting battle left Burgundians masters of the field, but they suffered greater casualties. Thus, both sides claimed victory. However, Louis found himself besieged in Paris, and once the Burgundian and Breton troops presented a united front, Louis could do little but wait out the seige. In time, Louis was forced to agree to the rebels' demands. Thus, the King's brother, Charles Duke of Berry, exchanged his appanage in Berry for the rich Duchy of Normandy. Burgundy received the Somme towns and Charles Count of Charolais received the territories ceded to Jean Count of Etampes and Nevers. Louis XI would not be compensated for Somme towns, and by the terms of the Treaty was not entitled to repurchase the territory until after Charles' death. The Duke of Bourbon was made Lieutenant-General of all the provinces of central France. The Count of Saint-Pol was made Constable of France.;x

EVENTHIST170139;Jean Bodin (or Baudin or Bodinus) was a 16th Century French jurist, natural law philosopher and precursor of Mecantilism. He had a varied and insatiable intellectual curiosity, reading practically everything he could get his hands on. Bodin noticed that clipping, debasement and imports of silver had a common feature: they all increased the amount of money relative to goods. Consequently, Bodin put forth what is generally acknowledged as one of the first statements of the Quantity Theory of Money, detailing the relationship between price levels and the money supply, generally speaking. In 1576-7, Bodin served as a delegate of the Third Estate in the Estates-General of Blois. Bodin threw his political lot in with Michel d'Hôpital, whose politiques faction was trying to construct a ''third way'' between the extremists of the Catholic Holy League and the Calvinist Union. Bodin urged for negotiations with the Calvinists rather than resumption of the religious wars and he opposed the sale of the monarchy's lands to raise funds for any such endeavor. It was during the height of his active political involvement that Bodin composed his celebrated Six Books (1576), wherein he expounded his famous theory of sovereignty, which were in many ways consonant with the political positions he had expounded at the Estates-General.;x

EVENTNAME170140;Jean-Baptiste Say;x
EVENTHIST170140;Jean-Baptiste Say was inspired to write his Treatise on Political Economy when, working at a life insurance office, he read a copy of Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations. His Treatise, often described as a popularization of Smith's ideas, departed from the typical economics methodology of his day. This departure was based on Say's conviction that the study of economics should start not with abstract mathematical and statistical analyses but with the real experience of the human person. Such a humanistic stress resulted in Say's emphasis on the role of the entrepreneur in an economy. In fact, this emphasis was Say's primary contribution to the field of economics. While popular abroad, Say's Treatise brought put him into conflict with Napoléon, who was furious at Say's refusal to tone down his criticism of France's disastrous fiscal policies. This run in with the French dictator soon forced Say to put his theory into practice. He was removed from the French government, and his book was suppressed. Undaunted, Say used the latest English technology to establish a cotton spinning plant, which became quite profitable for the ten years he owned it. Meanwhile, Say and his Treatise came to the attention of Thomas Jefferson and James Madison. Madison thought it the best book ever written about economics. Jefferson courted Say to be a professor of political economy at the new University of Virginia. It was not until 1814, with Napoléon exiled, that Say's Treatise came back into print in France. Say himself was finally appointed to a professorship in economics, first at the Athénée, then at the Conservatoire des Arts et Metiers, and finally at the College de France, where he occupied France's first chair in political economy.;x

Fearing that the troops were being placed for another royal massacre, public support for the Catholic League soared. Although Henri was in the position to arrest Guise and the leaders of the League, he prevaricated and lost the initiative. Frightened by shouts of 'Long live the duke of Guise' from while in the palace, Henri decided to abandon Paris. The revolution in Paris was made complete as Guise and the Sixteen (the Catholic League organization of Paris) supervised the takeover of nearly every major institution in the city. All the gates of the city were eventually secured and the Sixteen made it clear that no one was to leave or enter without express command of the new revolutionary government. Henri III was no longer master of his capital or the institutions of the government within. In July of 1588, Henri III signed the Edict of Union and was forced to recognize nearly all the demands of Guise and the Sixteen.

EVENTHIST170191;Maurice, comte de Saxe (Moritz von Sachsen, 1696-1750) was a general and military theorist who successfully led French armies during the War of the Austrian Succession (1740-48). Anna Ivanovna, duchess of Courland (later empress of Russia), secured Saxe's election as duke of Courland (a Baltic duchy between Prussia and Latvia) in 1726, but the Russians expelled him from the region in 1727 in order to prevent him from marrying the duchess. Returning to France, Saxe in 1732 wrote Mes Rêveries (published in 1756-57), a remarkably original treatise on the science of warfare. He served with distinction in the French army against his own half brother, King August III of Poland, in the War of the Polish Succession (1733-38) and in 1734 was made a lieutenant general. In November 1741, six months after France joined Prussia against Austria in the War of the Austrian Succession, Saxe invaded Bohemia and captured Prague. Although the British had not yet become involved in the conflict, the French King Louis XV in January 1744 made Saxe commander of a force that was to invade Great Britain on behalf of Charles Edward, the Young Pretender, the Stuart claimant to the British throne. The project was dropped after a storm shattered Saxe's invasion fleet at Dunkirk in March. Shortly thereafter, Louis formally declared war on Great Britain and promoted Saxe to the rank of marshal. Saxe and the King then invaded the Austrian Netherlands. The King wisely allowed Saxe to give the orders in the ensuing campaign. Their forces surrounded Tournai, and, when allied troops advanced from the east to relieve the siege, Saxe decisively defeated them in the Battle of Fontenoy (May 11, 1745). It was France's last great victory before the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789. Saxe then captured Brussels and Antwerp (February 1746). Turning south, he seized Mons and Namur, and on Oct. 11, 1746, he defeated the allies at Raucoux, near Liège, thereby completing the conquest of the Austrian Netherlands. In January 1747 Louis appointed Saxe marshal general of France. In 1747 he invaded Holland, defeated an allied army in the Battle of Lauffeld near Maastricht (July 2), and captured the fortress of Bergen-Op-Zoom. Saxe retired to his château at Chambord, where he died. His grandson was the father of the novelist George Sand.;x

At this time, there was already a strong party among the Corsican rebel leaders who were willing to bring Corsica under French domination, so they were quite disapointed when after a few parleys it became clear that the French troops were only acting on behalf of the Republic. De Boissieux too had learned something from these first meetings: that the Corsican rebels may give themselves to whichever power who would allow them to escape from Genoa, possibly an enemy of France. As for now, the rebels were gaining time, not daring to fight the French contingent until they were left choiceless. At the end of the year, new statutes were published, based upon the ones granted in 1733 with very few ameliorations, and of course arms would have to be surrendered. When the French troops began to move towards the interior to seize arms, the rebels were indeed left choiceless. On 13th December, the French were defeated by a large Corsican army at U Borgu and retreated towards Bastia. Reinforcements had to be sent and in the Spring of 1739 there were nearly 10000 French soldiers under the Marquis de Maillebois in Corsica. Against such a strong force, the rebels were soon militarily defeated. Corti fell at the end of June and on 10th July, Luiggi Giafferi, Ghjacintu Paoli and his young son Pasquale, Ghjuvan Ghjacumu Ambrosi and 26 other important leaders negotiated their exile from the island and took sail for Naples. The last fightings took place in the Dilà dei Monti until the end of October.;x

EVENTNAME170196;Taking charge in Corsica;x
EVENTHIST170196;At the beginning of 1740, the French government was very much aware of two facts that would determine its policy towards Genoa and Corsica for the next thirty years: firstly, most of the Corsican people hated the Genoese so much that they were ready to give themselves to any power once they would have thrown away the Genoese yoke, which would most certainly happen once the French troops had left the island, and secondly this power might very well be hostile towards France, which was unacceptable. For both of these reasons an official proposal was sent to the Genoese senate: France would administrate Corsica, including justice rendering and perception of taxes, for a number of years to be determined, until things would cool down some more.;x

EVENTHIST170200;Louis of Orleans, heir presumptive to the throne, along with several great French Lords including the Count of Dunois, Count of Albret, Duke of Bourbon, and the Duke of Lorraine, fled France for Brittany. Forgiven a first time by Charles VIII's Regent, Anne of Beaujeu, Louis continued to dispute the Regency's capacity. The French rebels took refuge in Nantes in the court of his friend, Duke François II, where he continued to intrigue against the French Regency and convince François to declare war on France. However, the great Barons of Brittany regarded Duke Louis II's arrival and subsequent entrenchment within François's council with contempt. As a consequence, some of Brittany's foremost nobles undertook a series of negotiations with the French. At Châteaubriant, the French proposed to join the Breton lords in ousting Louis II and his entourage from Brittany. The Treaty stipulated that the Breton barons would assist the royal troops to dislodge Louis of Orleans and his friends of the Duchy in exchange of the simple recognition of their rights.;x

EVENTHIST170201;Brittany's forces, depleted, and exhausted of fighting, could not resist the might of France. Louis II Duke of Orleans was captured and Duke Francois II could see little to gain with continued resistance. Thus, three weeks before his death, Francois made terms with King Charles VIII of France. The Treaty of Le Verger resulted in Francois's complete submission to King Charles, and a full recognition of Charles's rights as overlord of a French fiefdom of Brittany. A stipulation in the Treaty forced Francois to accept Charles's right to the wardship of the youthful Anne. Upon Francois's death, Charles pressed his right as Anne's ward.;x

EVENTHIST170203;After the success of the establishment in Quebec, the colonists wanted to push towards the Great Lakes in order to control the trade of the furs, to weave bonds with the Indian tribes and, perhaps, to find a passage towards the West.

EVENTHIST170204;One of the only resources of New France (Nouvelle France) was fur, exchanged with the Indian tribes. This trade, rather lucrative, attracted many adventurers ready to enter deeply in the lands in order to withdraw the invaluable resource from it. Historically, Pierre Esprit Radisson and Médart des Groseillers went in the north of Michigan and Superior Lakes to the Hudson Bay.

EVENTHIST170206;The French occupation of Brittany was now complete. The French troops had devastated Brittany and seized several fortress. Duchess Anne was taken prisoner and escorted to King Charles VIII with all the honors due to her standing. Charles VIII was now determined to have the Duchy for himself. Anne's 'bootless calf' marriage to Maximilian was annulled. In part to preserve as much of Brittany as was currently possible, Anne agreed to marry Charles. Thus, on December 6, 1491 Charles VIII married Anne of Brittany at Langeais.;x

EVENTHIST170207;The accidental death of Charles VIII in April 1498 settled the Crown of France on the heir presumptive, Louis II Duke of Orleans, now King Louis XII, whom had long since reconciled with his old rival, Anne de Beaujeu, mother of Charles VIII. The days of the League of the Public Weal were now distant memories, and as the King of France, Louis XII quickly adopted the role and policies of his predecessors. Charles VIII had promised his wife Anne, Duchess of Brittany, that should he die without male issue, Brittany would be freed of its obligations to the Crown of France. Charles and Anne had had four children together, yet all had perished in their youth. Faced with no other option, Louis XII would have to marry his predecessor's widow in order to keep the Duchy of Brittany close to the Crown of France. However, Louis was currently married to the pious and disabled Jeanne de France, daughter of King Louis XI, whom had designed the marriage decades ago in an attempt to extinguish the House of Orleans. Pope Alexander VI was willing to annul Louis' marriage in exchange for the elevation of his son, Cesare Borgia, Count of Valentinois, to the rank of Duke, and military aid for the Pope's efforts in Italy. Louis XII accepted the terms. The county of Valentinois became a Duchy, and Cesare Borgia became the first Duke of Valentinois.;x

Charles VIII had promised his wife Anne, Duchess of Brittany, that should he die without issue, Brittany would be freed of her obligations to the Crown of France, provided Anne marry his successor. Charles and Anne had had four children together, yet all had perished in their youth. Louis XII would have to choose between abiding by the treaty, or retain the Breton lands for the Crown.

Thus, François Ier moved to obtain from the estates of Brittany, gathered at Vannes on August 4, 1532, the authorization to definitively unify the Duchy with the Kingdom. The result of which was a union whereby certain facets of Brittany's privaledges within the realm of France were to be preserved, such as her Parliamentary rights.

To maintain at least the impression of legitimacy he did not directly annex these territories to France but chose to bestow them upon his loyal general Joachim Murat instead as the independent 'Grand Duchy of Berg and Cleves'.

Relieving Nevers at Casale, Richelieu concluded the Peace of Susa with Savoy (Apr 1630). Peace of Regensburg (Oct 1630) confirmed Mayenne's rights with concessions to Savoy and Guastalla whilst reducing the Habsburg presence in Italy. However France couldn't 'meddle in affairs of the Empire' which induced Richelieu to continue fighting til the Treaty of Cherasco (1631) that gave France the strategically vital Pignerol (plus Pinerolo in secret by Victor-Amédée I of Savoy).;x

On 13 August 1756 was signed the first Treaty of Compiègne, giving them control of Calvi, Aiacciu and San Fiurenzu.

On 6 August 1764 was signed the second Treaty of Compiègne, by which the Genoese surrendered five major stronholds to the French: Bastia, Aiacciu, San Fiurenzu, Calvi et Algaiola, keeping only Bonifaziu.

The two parties could never find an agreement since the French found that the Corsicans were far too demanding in regards of their effective military and diplomatic strength, while the Corsicans were always worried that the French would handle them back to Genoa, like they had in the past, if they surrendered too much of their independence.

EVENTHIST170261;After the Treaty of Versailles, France was bound to achieve what Genoa had been unable to during five centuries: establish public order. It took them five years of brutal and expeditive actions against both outlaws, thieves and criminals, and Paolists who had either remained in Corsica or were just returned from exile. Nonetheless, the Comte de Marbeuf, French military governor in the island, was cautious enough to not provoke any large-scale revolt. It was during one of his absence in May 1774 that the situation went awry. The Comte de Narbonne, second in command to Marbeuf, who had been urging him for years to increase the degree of violence against the 'bandits' and their families and villages, suddendly found himself in a position to do it by himself, especially when the returned exiles gave him an opportunity by launching a round of small localized revolts against French troops, in the hope to rally the population to an eventual return of Paoli. The Paolists thought it wise to act during Marbeuf's absence, it turned out it wasn't. Narbonne reacted most violently. Entire villages were burnt down and known rebels' families chased from their homes, while captured 'rebels' were hanged without any form of trial. By the end of the year, there were no more rebels.;x

The latter was elected lieutenant-colonel and it was against him and his party that the population was rising against. The antagonism between Pasquale Paoli, who had become a constitutional monarchist in England, and Nabuliu Buonaparte, once a most fervent admirer of Paoli, but now gained to the radical ideas of the Revolution and soon a follower of Robespierre, then grew for one year until after some violent fighting opposing the two factions in April and May 1793, Buonaparte had to flee from Corsica on 11 June after having hardly escaped from Paoli's men.;x

His followers assured the government in Paris of their loyalty, but meanwhile they ignored the representants of the Convention in Corsica and placed all military and administrative powers into the hands of Paoli and his close partisans. When news came to Paris of the Corsican open rebellion on 17 july, the Convention immediately destituted Paoli and issued orders to have him arrested. By this decision, they left Paoli, who was still willing to negotiate, without any alternative.;x

EVENTNAME170265;La Croceta;x
EVENTHIST170265;Corsica had always been a strongly catholic province and was among the french regions which had counted the most refractory priests. The revolt that started in December 1797 in the North-East of the island became known as La Croceta (A Crucetta in Corsican) because of the small white cross that the first insurgents would sew upon their hats was mostly a religious revolt after years of administrative persecution against the Catholic church. The rebels were mostly peasants which explains that, when the foremost leaders were either killed or captured, the revolt would die down as quickly as it had started, in spite or because of the violent repression.;x

EVENTNAME170266;War of the Fium'orbu;x
EVENTHIST170266;Bernardinu Poli was a much trusted and faithful Bonapartist Corsican officer. When it became known that he was still in possession of the diamonds left to him by Joachim Murat before his departure for Naples, and that he was 'keeping himself', according to the Corsican saying, in his small village at Sari di Porti Vechju, the Marquis de Rivière, Extraordinary Commissar of Louis XVIII in Corsica, attempted to capture him. First by treason, which failed, then by force which failed too faced with the arising of the whole region known as the Fium'orbu. On 18 April 1816, a 8000 strong French army was defeated and Rivière was nearly captured. Shortly after this humiliating defeat, Rivière was removed from office and his successor negotiated Poli's exile for Austria, with the diamonds.;x

EVENTNAME170268;Witch-hunting in France;x
EVENTHIST170268;The medieval Inquisition tried a large number of witches, but collective witch-hunting was exclusively a modern phenomena. Individual maleficium (Latin for witchcraft) was not uncommon in many rural areas, but it wasn't until scholastic demonology related witches and Sabbaths (night meetings with strong conspiracy elements, including cannibalism, orgies and a sacred oath of loyalty to Satan himself) that societies started to get obsessed with the matter. This conspiracy paranoia can track its roots as far as to the first massacres of Jews and Lepers in the High Middle Ages, when thousands were slaughtered by defeated Crusaders and angry countrymen. But it's in the early 15th century when demonological theories will become fully accepted by the upper classes. The Councils of Constance and Basel are considered to be the first public space in which these concepts, maleficium and Sabbath were publicly related. The work of Johannes Nider (1380-1438), The Formicarius (The Anthill), was a masterpiece of scholastic demonology and marked a new era in witch-hunting. The work of Heinrich Kramer (1430-1505), Malleus Maleficarum (Hammer of the Wicked) was the first work that reaches widespread attention, and works as a inquisitorial manual for witch-hunters. But it's not the Church that tries the most in Modern Ages. On the contrary, civil courts are responsible for 85-90 percent of executions. \n \nFrance is home to the very first conspiracy theories as early as the beginning of the 14th century. A powerful and centralized government was the only thing that stopped French towns from burning thousands of witches.;x

Forgiven a first time by the Regent of France, Anne de Beaujeu, he continued to resist her regime. In January 1487, he was again forced to flee with several great lords of France, the count of Dunois, Albret, the Duke of Bourbon, and the Duke of Lorraine, taking refuge in Nantes in the court of his friend Duke François II. Louis and his French noble peers were admitted into François' Council, much to the chagrin of the principal Breton lords who were forced to make way. Louis and his peers proceeded to encourage François to prepare for war with France.;x

After his father's final exile, Berwick served in the French army. \nAs a soldier, Berwick was highly esteemed for his courage, abilities and integrity. As a result of distinguished service in the War of the Spanish Succession, he became a French subject and was appointed a Marshal of France after his successful expedition against Nice in 1706. On 25 April 1707, Berwick won the great and decisive victory of Almanza, where an Englishman at the head of a Franco-Spanish army defeated Ruvigny, a Frenchman at the head of an Anglo-Portuguese-Dutch army. After Almanza, Berwick was created Duc de Fitz-James in the Peerage of France by Louis XIV, and Duque de Liria y Xérica and Lieutenant of Aragon by Philip V of Spain. The last great event of the War of the Spanish Succession was the storming of Barcelona by Berwick, after a long siege, on 11 September 1714.;x

EVENTNAME170276;The Praguerie;x
EVENTHIST170276;The Praguerie was a revolt of the French nobility against King Charles VII in 1440. It was caused by the reforms of Charles VII at the close of the Hundred Years' War, by which he sought to lessen the anarchy in France. The attempt to reduce the brigand-soldiery, and especially the ordinances passed by the estates of langue d'oïl at Orléans in 1439, which not only gave the King an aid of 100,000 francs (an act which was later used by the King as though it were a perpetual grant and so freed him from that parliamentary control of the purse so important in England), but demanded as well royal nominations to officerships in the army, marked a gain in the royal prerogative which the nobility resolved to challenge.The main instigator was Charles I, Duke of Bourbon, who three years before had attempted a similar rising, and had been forced to ask pardon of the King.;x

EVENTNAME170280;Annexation of the Kingdom of Holland;x
EVENTHIST170280;Much to the surprise of Napoléon, Louis took his royal responsibilities seriously and attempted to rule in the interests of the Dutch. In particular he enraged his elder brother by not taking sufficiently strenuous measures to prevent trade between the Dutch ports and Britain, thus leaving a loophole in the Continental System.\n Louis had to abdicate on July 1, 1810. He was succeeded by his five year old son Napoléon Louis Bonaparte. Napoléon Louis reigned as Louis II for just ten days. Napoléon ignored his young nephew's accession to the throne, abolished the Kingdom of Holland and incorporated the region under direct rule within the French Empire.;x

EVENTHIST170282;By 1453, at the end of the Hundred Years War, it was the only part of France to remain in English hands. Despite some squabbles over the next hundred years, it was considered a part of England (at least, by the English). The area was finally ceded to France in 1558 by Mary of England after French troops, led by Francis, Duke of Guise, took the town of Calais.;x

EVENTHIST170283;The Duchy of Warsaw was a Polish state established by Napoléon in 1807 from the Polish lands ceded by the Kingdom of Prussia under the terms of the Treaties of Tilsit. The duchy was held in personal union by one of Napoléon's allies, King Friedrich August III of Saxony.\n Following Napoléon's failed invasion of Russia, the duchy was occupied by Prussian and Russian troops until 1815, when it was formally partitioned between the two countries at the Congress of Vienna.;x

EVENTHIST170284;In the Congress of Vienna, Poland again was the victim of the victorious powers appetite. As most Poles had been staunch supporters of the French to the very end - only a group of Polish nobles around Prince Adam Czartoryski had accepted the Czar as Poland's lord - they were not represented on the Congress. Russian Czar Alexander planned the reestablihment of a Polish Kingdom in dynastic union with Russia. This kingdom would comprise of the Duchy of Warsaw an possibly include territories further east, acquired by Russia in the Polish Partitions 1772-1795.\n However, the British side had objections, and a compromise was found according to which the province of Posen became Prussian, and the rest of the Duchy of Poland (Congress Poland) was reestablished as a Kingdom, in dynastic union with Russia. Cracow was declared a free city under the joint protection of its three neighbours, Austria, Prussia and Russia.;x

EVENTNAME170300;Boerenkrijg;x
EVENTHIST170300;The Boerenkrijg or 'Peasant's war' was a planned revolt in the southern Netherlands that broke out early because of a conscription law requiring every man of a certain age to serve in the army. It was a major revolt in which cities were captured and the French lost several battles. The same events led to a smaller revolt known as the Klöpplkrieg in Luxembourg.;x

EVENTNAME170301;The Concordat with the Roman Catholic Church;x
EVENTHIST170301;The Civil Constitution of the Clergy had reduced the number of bishoprics in France from 136 to 83, confiscated church property and turned priests into civil servants of the state. It had also alienated moderate reformers such as the Girondins who saw Catholicism as part of France. The resulting UltraMontaine movement that looked 'over the mountains' to Rome for salvation caused a split that the Jacobins had been able to exploit and that continued to cause problems in French society. Napoléon was determined to unify the country again and on 26 Messidor, IX (July 16, 1802) Pope Pius VII and First Consul Bonaparte reestablished the Catholic Church in France.;x

EVENTHIST170333;The French East India Company was a commercial enterprise, founded in 1664 to compete with the British and Dutch East India companies. Planned by Jean Baptiste Colbert, it was chartered by King Louis XIV for the purpose of trading in the Eastern Hemisphere. The first Director General for the Company was François Caron, who had spent 30 years working for the Dutch East India Company. The company was granted a 50-year monopoly on French trade in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, a region stretching from the Cape of Good Hope to the Straits of Magellan. The Company failed to found a successful colony on Madagascar, but was able to establish ports on the nearby islands of Bourbon and Île-de-France (today's Réunion and Mauritius).

EVENTNAME170700;Reforms in the Holy Roman Empire;x
EVENTHIST170700;In the end of the 15th century the Holy Roman Empire of German Nation was far from being an effective state. The need for a reform was obvious, and acknowledged by a strong movement for imperial reform that emerged in the late 1480s. However, such a reform was hindered by conflicting ideas on what state should be the outcome of the reform. One group, consisting of the Emperor and his allies among the imperial cities and the weaker princes of the realm, supported reforms that would enable the Emperor to exploit Germany's considerable resources more effectively than in the past. In order to accomplish that, they demanded major innovations such as a regular system of imperial taxation and a regular administration of Germany in absentia by an imperial governing council that was to be kept under the Emperor's control. The emperor has made more extensive reforms that could ensure a more effective administration and could turn Germany into a powerful national Kingdom. This forceful revival of the medieval Kingdom of Germany has alarmed courts throughout Europe, and hostile reaction is forming against this usurper state. There is a strong call for severing ties and declaring war on the emperor.;x

During the 15th century Groningen consolidated it's power in the Ommelanden, and there were continuous struggles with foreign threats. Holland, which was ruled by the Bavarian House by now, tried to get hold of Friesland and Groningen. The Bishop of Utrecht tried to effectuate his rights on Groningen and Drente. And a powerfull count in Oost-Friesland tried to conquer the Ommelanden. In the end all these attacks were repulsed, and Groningen became effectively an independent citystate. She had direct rule over the Gorecht and the Oldambts, and a strong treaty with the Ommelanden that gave her political and economic preponderance. Westerwolde was in pledge from the Bishop of Munster, and she had garrisons along the Eastern border. Large parts of Friesland were subordinate to her and in several cities in Friesland she had blockhouses with garrisons. Her coat of arms was a double imperial eagle, sign of an free imperial city. The sovereignty of the Bishop had become a hollow formality. In 1490, Groningen lost its major seaport of Delfzijl, this loss slowly ebbed the demise as Emden which lies on the opposite side of the river gained in precedence, Emden was now controlled by the Cirksena dynasty, counts of east Frisia.;x

He was orphaned at a young age and became a soldier of fortune fighting for various Italian princes. From 1524 to 1528 he fought in a number of battles for the French as a general in the service of King François Ier. He became dissatisfied as François was mean about payment for his services. In 1528 when his contract expired he staged a coup and took control of Genoa. This gave him the opportunity to join the service of Charles I of Spain (the emperor Charles V) in exchange for which Charles guaranteed Genoa's status as an independent republic. Under this arrangement Genoa was brought into the Spanish orbit and it remained one of Spain's most loyal allies for more than 150 years, serving as the port for Milan, the center of Spanish power in Northern Italy.;x

Political rights were limited to the nobility along with several of the more prominent common families who were ennobled. The Liber Civitas, the Genoese equivalent to Venice's Golden Book, listed all those in the political class, although the oligarchy was never as closed as was Venice's. These reforms ended the chronic unrest that had plagued Genoa for the previous 150 years.

Giovanni Luigi Fieschi, count of Lavagna, was descended from one of the greatest families of Liguria. When he determined to conspire against Doria he found friends in many quarters. Pope Paul III was the first to encourage him, while both Pier Luigi Farnese, duke of Parma, and François Ier of France gave him much assistance.

In 1475 a large Turkish fleet under Grand Vizier Keduk Akhmet Pasha arrived to conduct a naval landing and started to besiege Kaffa with Tatar aid.

EVENTHIST174028;Although several peace treaties were stipulated as to guarantee a certain balance of powers in Italy, they couldn't prevent Alfonso I King of Naples from pursuing his old interests on Genoese territories, notably Corsica, and West Mediterranean sea trade routes. Since the confederates of Lega Italica, amongst them Milan, wouldn't risk to break that fragile alliance, and some Genoese families, Adorno and Fieschi amongst them, had clearly in mind to support the Aragonese, King Alfonso represented a real threat for Genoa and the Fregoso family. In 1458, facing a new Aragonese aggression Genoa could only find help in France as it frequently occurred in the past. Charles VII, King of France, accepted the Genoese allegiance and sent Jean d'Anjou, Duke of Calabria and son of René d'Anjou to rule over Genoa. As soon as he established himself in the city as Governor, with the support of the Genoese fleet he arranged a military expedition to be led against Naples with the aim of getting the crown, which his father René failed to succeed in. But this time the political situation in Naples played in his favour: the local barons were opposing Ferdinando, Alfonso's natural son, not recognising him as the new King of Naples.

Since the military expedition led by Jean d'Anjou to conquer the Kingdom of Naples failed and the rebelling Neapolitan barons eventually agreed to recognize Ferdinando as their King, Louis XI of France decide to abandon his plan to control the Genoese Republic granting his friend and ally Francesco Sforza, Duke of Milan, ownership's rights to the city of Genoa. Sforza soon sent an army led by Giacomo Vimercate to submit the city.

As soon as a combined attack in order to surround the duchy was driven by French and Venetian troops simultaneoulsy, town after town surrendered while the Milanese troops preferred to compromise with the enemy instead of fighting. The Milanese population, already adversed to Sforza because of his harsh taxation policy, rebelled forcing il Moro to escape with his family and treasure to Innsbruck at the court of his liege Maximilian, King of the Romans and Archduke of Austria. The French troops led by Gian Giacomo Trivulzio, entered the city of Milan without any resistance receiving a unexpected welcome by the population which Sforza had harshly taxed. Even the castle's garrison surrendered without any fight to the French invaders. Following the example of Milan and of other Lombard cities, also the Republic of Genoa, which Sforza had being ruling since 1488, swore allegiance to the new masters.

EVENTNAME174033;Corsicans will pledge to us;x
EVENTHIST174033;Since the middle of the fourteenth century, Corsica had been divided into three political entities. In the South, Dilà dei Monti (Beyond the Mountains) was the Terra di'Signori, the Land of the Lords held by feudal dynasties. The five most important were all issued from the same ancestor: Arrigu di Cinarca. The di Leca, the della Rocca, the d'Istria, the d'Ornanu and the di Bozzi kept fighting each other all the time, and alliances and truces between them were broken as easily as they were made. Having their support was essential for a foreign power trying to control this part of the island so they often found themselves supported in their petty strives by Pisa, Genoa or Aragon. Two of the Cinarchesi only managed to unite the whole Dilà under their rule. The first one had been Sinucellu Ghjudice di Cinarca (1219-1307) before dying in a Genoese cell. The second one was Vincentellu d'Istria appointed as a Viceroy by Alfons V of Aragon in 1416. In the North, Diquà dei Monti (Beneath the Mountains) was the Terra di U Cumunu, the Land of the Communes held by villagers' communities led by magistrates and making their own laws though they most often paid taxes to some higher authority. The original organization was kind of democratic but the powerful local families soon took the habit to manipulate the electoral system to keep the important positions between themselves. Some of them had been, or later would be, ennoblished by Genoa and frequent marriages occured between the d'Omessa, the della Casabianca, the di Matra, the di Casta and many others, and the Cinarchese or the Capicorsi lords. They were also merchant families who asked for peace and order before anything else and were ready to submit to whomever was insuring those, be they Pisan or Genoese Republics, or Aragonese Viceroy. In the Capicorsu, the Corsican Cape being the northernmost tip of the island, Genoese noble families had settled during the tweltfh and thirteenth centuries. Although they might be considered as Corsican more than a century later, the da Mare and the de Gentile still had strong ties with their branches which had remained in Genoa. They always provided the best support for the Genoans in their wars on the island. Only on a few occasions, when they deemed themselves tricked or robbed by the Republic, would they attempt to rebel or join ongoing revolts.\nThe Aragonese viceroy, Vincentellu d'Istria, was captured at sea. Tried in Genoa, he was executed on 27th April 1434. Simone da Mare, a Genoese nobleman elected Count by the rebels immediately pledged fealty to the Republic of Genoa and ruled on its behalf thereafter.;x

At the end of that year, the Republic endeavoured to take direct control back. Giovanni and Nicolo da Montaldo, sons of the former governor, were sent with troops in Corsica. They quickly rallied their partisans there and managed to defeat the two false pretenders. They also bought some key-fortresses to gain a tighter control over the countryside and eventually, they threw the da Mare lord in prison.;x

Crimes remained unpunished and taxes couldn't be raised. Some islander leaders then offered to submit to the Bank of St George in the hope that the Genoese institution would be able to restore order. The Capituale Corsorum signed by the Bank's representatives and the Corsican delegates gave authority to the former for all matters of public order, justice rendering and perception of taxes in the island.

They were even invited to a magnificent banquet in Vicu, one of the main villages of Cinarca. When desert was served, the lords were brutally seized and put to death. Six of them were beheaded and fourteen others hanged. Only a handful of the Cinarchesi survived, either because they had wisely ignored the invitation or because they were still in exile. In the following year their partisans were pursued and imprisoned or put to death.;x

EVENTNAME174043;The League of Pisa;x
EVENTHIST174043;The conspiracy developed among the exiled survivors of Vicu. They chose themselves a Genoese leader: Tomassino da Campofregoso, son of the former Doge Giano, whose mother was Corsican. Aware of Tommasino's ambitions the Genoans kept him safely in prison but his allies decided to attack anyway. Old Paulu della Rocca was there, with Raffe di Leca's cousins and even Vincentellu d'Istria's nephew.;x

EVENTHIST174051;With the murder of Rinucciu della Rocca at the hand of a hired traitor in 1511, and the death of Ghjuvan Paulu di Leca in Rome four years later, the two most powerful lineages which had rebelled against us in the past century had come to an end. Their demesnes were seized and their heirs killed or forced into exile.;x

EVENTHIST174052;The only thing the Bank of St George was successful with in Corsica was dealing with the rebel aristocracy and the highest lineages are now destroyed or tamed. All other efforts to have Corsica begin its economic development have failed miserably and they lost a lot of money in these projects. The Bank is now willing to cede the island back to us.

EVENTNAME174056;Peasants revolts;x
EVENTHIST174056;In August 1615, bloody uprisings took place in the South-West of Corsica. This time, instead of targetting the Genoese garrisons or tax perceptors, the peasants assaulted the castles of their own local lords, the di Bozzi family. Many important members of this ancient feudal dynasty were slaughtered and the Genoese comissars had to react most violently: a small army was sent in the rebellious areas and the captured leaders were hanged or sent to the galleys. Taxes were maintained and the di Bozzi were put back in charge.;x

ACTIONNAME174056B;Side with the peasants;x
#;x
EVENTNAME174057;Corsicans are chased from Papal service;x
EVENTHIST174057;It all began when Corsican Guards, upon orders, pursued a man wanted for debts up to gardens of the Cardinal d'Este's palace. The French prelate's men protected the fugitive and repelled the Pope's guards, twice. A strong enmity ensued between French people in Rome and Corsican Guards, culminating on 20th August 1662 when a violent brawl between Corsicans and soldiers of the French ambassador, the Duke of Créquy, took place in a tavern. In the evening, the Duke's palace was assaulted and the ambassadress's carriage was even shot at. Six men died, including a civilian who happened to belong to the Duke's household. Louis XIV reacted immediately by sending back the Nuncio from Paris, invaded the Comtat- Venaissin and asked for the Corsican Guard to be entirely disbanded and for the Corsicans to be declared unfit to serve the Papal States. Before that, fifty of its members would have to be hanged and three-hundred and fifty others sent to the galleys.\nWe have been complaining several times to the Pope about his recruiting officers helping emptying Corsica. He has just agreed to the French demands when he had been disregarding ours for many years.;x
ACTIONNAME174057A;Good for us, or is it really?;x
#;x
EVENTNAME174058;Greek refugees in Corsica;x
EVENTHIST174058;The Republic considered Corsica as a colony since 1284 and its victory upon Pisa and most important coastal cities originated with Genoese settlers from the mainland. This policy was pursued during the following centuries and became even more intensive after the Cinarchese Wars and the War of the French, throughout the 'Iron Century' (1569-1729). One of the most peculiar group of settlers were in fact Greeks. On January 18th 1676, an agreement was signed between the Genoese Magistrates and the leaders of a community originating from Maïna in Morea. Fleeing from the Ottomans, the Stephanopoli brothers and their people were given land in Corsica and Genoese citizenship. This made them into most faithful supporters of Genoa and as a consequence created heavy tensions with the surrounding Corsican villages so that Greek settlings were often raided by various revolters. During the Forty Years War, they even had to flee to Ajaccio for a time before being resettled by the French in Carghjese, where they still are.;x
ACTIONNAME174058A;Settle them there;x
ACTIONNAME174058B;We owe them nothing;x
#;x
EVENTNAME174061;Corsican lords are now our loyal subjects;x
EVENTHIST174061;The Cinarchese lords' privileges are confirmed and their nobility is officially recognized by the Genoese Senate. This makes them free from taxes and they will levy them upon their own demesnes. They shall have no reason to bear arms against us ever again.;x
ACTIONNAME174061A;Fine;x
#;x
EVENTNAME174062;Corsican lords still want more;x
EVENTHIST174062;The Cinarchese lords seem to want a near independence allowing them to choose themselves other lieges than the Republic. This is of course unacceptable, and has been deemed as such by our emissaries who finally broke the negociations and left the island.;x

EVENTNAME174063;The castles are destroyed and the lords dead or gone;x
EVENTHIST174063;The cost may be heavy for the Dilà dei Monti but finally, the descendants of Ghjudice di Cinarca are either dead or exiled. Entire villages had to be burnt to the ground, whole cities had to be forcefully submitted before the lords had to take refuge in their high strongholds. Those had to be taken by siege, one after the other. At last it seems we are the masters of Western Corsica.;x
ACTIONNAME174063A;Fine;x
#;x
EVENTNAME174064;Papal intervention in Corsica;x
EVENTHIST174064;Tired of the endless fighting between various local factions and foreign invaders, five most eminent leaders of the Diquà dei Monti have called to the Pope and officially asked him to retake Corsica under full control. Soon, those men began to raise the Communes with help from Papal emissaries. Later, an army would come.;x

#;x
EVENTNAME174068;The return of Campofregoso family;x
EVENTHIST174068;Since Galeazzo Maria openly ruled his duchy as a tyrant he made many enemies amongst the Milanese noble families. On 26th december 1476 he was assassinated in Saint Stephen's church during religious mass. hand Cicco Simonetta, Sforza's secretary of State, managed to have Galeazzo's son, Gian Galeazzo, being proclaimed Duke while his mother Bona of Savoy being acknowledged as regent until Duke's minority. That provoked resentment in the brothers of the assassinated duke, also aming at the regency title, but negotiations were successfully conducted by Simonetta. If in Milan calm was restored an uprise broke in Genoa against the Milanese Governor Pallavicini led by members of the Fieschi and Campofregoso families united togetheragainst the Sforza rule. Cicco Simonetta gained the favour of Prospero Adorno, once opposer to Galeazzo's rule thus releasing him from prison, with the promise to crush the revolt and reeastablish the Milanese rule over Genoa. Adorno occupied Genoa and became Governor for Milan. But Adorno started to have contacts with the King of Naples and they represented a sign of rebellion. Battista Fregoso, member of the Campofregoso family, which gave several doges to the city, was asked to intervene in crushing the rebellion in order to restore the Sforza lordship over the Republic. Battista Fregoso managed to chase Adorno away and to proclaim himself Doge of the Republic. Milan didn't solve the problems with the administratio of Genoa as the new doge didn't seem to acknowledge Sforza's lordship over Genoa, instead he followed a policy of partnership with Milan without acknowledging the Duke as suzerain.;x
#;x
EVENTNAME174069;Revolts in Boziu and Rustinu;x
EVENTHIST174069;The reasons were ancient and many: peasantry overburdened with taxes, upper and middle classes deprived of political and economical power, a colonial economy implying shameless pillaging of primary resources and massive importation of manufactured goods, obvious dicriminations between natives and Genoese citizens when it came to civil employment and judiciary matters.\nNow to the spark, it is told that on 27th December 1729, in the province of Boziu, Anton Francescu Lanfranchi, who was known as 'Cardone', was cruelly punihsed by the Genoese tax-collectors because he could not pay the due seini. The Due Seini were a very unfair tax, supposedly temporary, which had been instaured fifteen years earlier after Genoa had finally agreed to the Nobili Dodeci's longtime request to forbid firearms in Corsica. To compensate the resulting loss of income (the Republic used to sell licences for firearms) it was then decreed that every family would have to pay this new tax, which was approximatively equivalent to the licence's price. De facto, Corsicans were paying Genoa to forbid firearms, which were only needed because Genoa was not able to enforce law and order in the island.;x
ACTIONNAME174069A;Order will soon be restored;x
#;x
EVENTNAME174070;The revolt spreads like a wildfire;x
EVENTHIST174070;In the beginning of 1730, the initial localized uprising became a generalized revolt. Groups of insurgents were all over the island. Genoese companies were ambushed or openly defeated, and arms were seized. An assault was launched upon Bastia on 19th February, and upon Aiacciu on 8th March. The Genoese governor tried to cool things down through a local council of elected notables: the Nobili Dodeci, an institution two and a half centuries old. The two foremost negotiators designated to approach the rebels, Luiggi Giafferi and Andria Ceccaldi, joined their side in April. In May, the insurgents first formulated some revendications, especially about lowering of taxes and freedom of trade. Genoa made very few concessions and in the summer the fightings resumed. By then, the situation was out of control for Genoa. Bastia was even taken twice: in August and then again in December.;x
#;x
EVENTNAME174071;We are losing control;x
EVENTHIST174071;In January 1731, Corsican leaders held a meeting in Corti. This was the first attempt to create a new local administration and an organized army. The Genoese were still trying to regain control through their last allies: a Capicorsu lord and the Bishop of Mariana even had a meeting with the rebel leaders. But meanwhile, the new administration was now engaged in a fight with the cities still faithful to Genoa: Sarté, Algaiola and San Fiurenzu were taken between March and April. In the late spring, Genoa was only holding its four historical citadels: Bastia, Aiacciu, Calvi and Bunifaziu.;x
ACTIONNAME174071A;This is getting nasty;x
#;x
EVENTNAME174072;Ask for Austrian support;x
EVENTHIST174072;On 10th May 1731, the Genoese ambassador in Vienna, Marquis Gian Luca Pallavicini, was received by Karl II to present a request for military assistance on behalf of the Republic. On 10th August, nearly 4000 Austrian soldiers landed at Bastia under the Baron of Wachtendonck, with them were 3000 Genoese under Camillo Doria. The two men often disagreed as the Genoese often found the Austrian officer's attitude too conciliary towards the rebels. Some more troops landed at Calvi in early april 1732 under the Prince of Wurtemberg and there were now around 10000 Austrians in the island. In less than a month, this first revolt was over and the foremost leaders surrendered and were transfered in Genoa.;x

EVENTNAME174074;The Concessioni Graziose;x
EVENTHIST174074;In January 1733 were published the Gracious Concessions granted by Genoa to the Corsicans under the firm pressure of Karl II. Those were very minor concessions, a few taxes were abolished and most of them were cancelled for 1732, some public offices were opened to Corsicans and there was a general amnesty for the rebels who would swear to remain faithful and loyal to the Republic. It could only bring peace for a while.;x

#;x
EVENTNAME174076;Ghjacintu Paoli;x
EVENTHIST174076;For a moment order was restored in Corsica and the foremost leaders were imprisoned in Genoa. They were released a few months later but they were not allowed to come back to Corsica. Luiggi Giafferi entered the service of the Duke of Parma, while Andria Ceccaldi was to be found at the court of Felipe V. The Genoese, still feeling unsecure, endeavoured to capture the second-hand leaders, men like Ghjacintu Paoli or Ghjuvan Ghjacumu Ambrosi who were still in contact with the exiles. An attempt to seize them turned into a battle where the Genoese soldiers were routed. This is how the second round of revolts began. Freed from the fear of an Austrian intervention, thanks to the conflict about the Polish succession, the Corsican rebels took arms again. Corti, the historical capital, was taken in February and soon the exiled leaders were back and the revolters took hope again.;x
#;x
EVENTNAME174077;Theodor von Neuhoff, King of Corsica;x
EVENTHIST174077;Quite discouraged by their lack of diplomatic success, and demoralized by the Genoese blocus, the rebels were on the brink to ask for surrendering terms when a strange adventurer landed in Corsica. He was not unknown from the Corsican leaders whom he had met in Livorno during their exile. Somehow he persuaded them to crown him King of Corsica. He was only bringing a few thousands rifles and some cannons, but he was also promising to rid Corsica from Genoese domination thanks to his diplomatic relations throughout the courts of Europe, most importantly in Spain, and France... Under his direction, the rebels took hope again and renewed assaults were launched upon the remaining Genoese citadels.;x

EVENTNAME174083;Theodore von Neuhoff is roaming around Corsica;x
EVENTHIST174083;At the beginning of 1743, borne by the English Royal Navy, the former so-called King of Corsica attempted a return in his island. He landed a couple of times and met some of the rebel leaders, some of which tried to raise the country in the East. At this moment it was already too late, the international alliances had shifted and most Corsican leaders didn't trust him anymore.;x

#;x
ACTIONNAME174085A;We no longer have a choice;x
#;x
EVENTNAME174086;The Marquis de Cursay in Corsica;x
EVENTHIST174086;When the French landed in 1748, the Genoese were in no position to oppose them. Moreover they still hoped that they would manage to quell the revolts like they had ten years earlier. Soon it became clear that the French commander was here to negotiate with the rebel leaders who were allowed some kind autonomy in the areas which they controlled. The French kept promising that they would leave but feeling that most of the population was friendly towards them and dreaded the return of the Genoese, they showed no sign of moving. The first incidents between French and pro-Genoese Corsicans happened near Sarté in November 1751. The next year, more serious fights opposed French and Genoese soldiers first in Bastia and then in other places as the newly appointed Genoese Comissar Giovanni Grimaldi was touring the island.;x
ACTIONNAME174086A;The French are too conciliant;x
ACTIONNAME174086B;They're doing fine;x
#;x
EVENTNAME174088;Pasquale Paoli;x
EVENTHIST174088;In 1755, the situation was back to a stalemate in Corsica. Dissenssions were rising amongst the Supreme Council established by the rebels after the assassination of Gaffori two years earlier and some of its members were now advocating to open negotiations with Genoa. This is when Clemente Paoli called unto his brother Pasquale who was living in mainland Italy. He was a soldier, having served as an officer, first in the Real Corsica and then in the Real Farnese in Sicily. And he was also an intellectual mostly influenced by Montesquieu and having studied at the University of Naples. During his sixteen years exile with his father Ghjacintu, he had had much time to devise great projects for his island, so with him ended the Corsican Revolt and the Corsican Revolution began.;x
#;x
EVENTHIST174090;In the beginnings of 1759, reports from French intelligence established that the English were more likely to land in Southern France. At the end of April, the troops occupying the three Corsican ports were moved to Provence. The rebels, who had been relatively quiet during the French stay, renewed their attacks against the Genoese coastal strongholds.;x
#;x
EVENTNAME174092;The Treaty of Versailles;x
EVENTHIST174092;In 1767, the Republic, heavily indebted towards France after the various French interventions in Corsica, and the pro-Genoese cities in the island, finally acknowledged that the rebels could not be overcome by force. On 4 July, the Genoese ambassador in Paris, Agostino Sorba, was mandated to offer France full sovereignty over Corsica. The French, who had been waiting thirty years for this opportunity, did not miss the occasion and the Treaty of Versailles, signed on 15 May 1768, officialized the mortgaging of Corsica by Genoa to France. Of course, the island was to be ceded back if the Republic was ever able to pay back but everyone, Genoese, French and Corsicans, was well aware that this would almost surely never happen.;x
#;x
EVENTNAME174093;The French will take charge in Corsica;x

Although Nur Dawlat was the rightful heir by the succession laws of the Golden Horde, Mengli, Hajji's other son, had the support of ambitious clansmen. Taking refuge in the Genoese colonies, Mengli asked for Genoa's support in overthrowing his brother. Nur Dawlat had become a concern for Genoese merchants as his stronghanded rule threatened Genoese trading in the region.;x

EVENTNAME3689;The Disintegration of the Golden Horde;x
EVENTHIST3689;Until the disintegration of the Mongol empire (14th cent.) the khans themselves were under the suzerainty of the great khan at Karakorum. In the early 14th century the empire of the Golden Horde adopted Islam as its official religion. Thus, Russia was exposed to both Muslim and Asian civilization. Internecine warfare among the Tatar leaders and attempts by the Russian princes, such as Dmitri Donskoi, to end tributary payments contributed to the decline of the Empire of the Golden Horde in the late 14th cent. The state was conquered by Timur, who in 1395 dealt a final blow by sacking Sarai Berke. After his death the empire broke up into the independent khanates of Astrakhan, Kazan, Crimea, and Sibir.;x

EVENTHIST40056;Following the invasion of Tamerlane, Golden Horde fell into vast disarray. Court intrigues and a lack of any strong personalities created a situation of perpetual civil war. Ulugh Muhammad's first attempt to grasp the power in Sarai ended with his expulsion after only a few months of rule. However, eight years later he would return with a vengeance.;x

EVENTHIST40057;While khans fought in Sarai, Ulugh Muhammad was biding his time and gaining strength. Finally, early in 1427 he decided that the time is ripe, and marched south on Sarai. Learning of his fast approach and lacking any support, khan Berke fled, leaving Sarai to Ulugh Muhammad. His return and long rule finally brought stability to Golden Horde.;x

EVENTNAME287000;Independence of the Uzbeks;x
EVENTHIST287000;By the 15th century,the power of the Golden Horde was in full decline. Its power in the former lands of the White Horde was feeble at best, non-existant at worst. In fact, many small Kingdoms had appeared in the east, the most powerful of all, being On's Kingdom, the precusor to the Khanate of Sibir. In 1428, in the city of Sibir, Abul Khayr was named the khan of the Uzbek Horde. The region finally had its own local ruler, but at the cost of the Golden Horde. However, with its principal lands in shambles, those centered around the Volga River, the khan of the Golden Horde could do little better than to accept the existence of Khayr's dominion, lest he wanted to provoke another conflict. And so in 1428, the Uzbek Khanate was free.;x

EVENTNAME287001;The Khanate of Sibir;x
EVENTHIST287001;Following the disintegration of the Horde, descendents of On Khan formed the Khanate of Sibir, near the modern day city of Tyumen. They quickly established their domain which existed from Kurgan in the West, to Ichim in the East. This khanate would survive well into the 16th century until it was extinguished by cossacks from Russia.;x

This was a common practice in the past, and so the Khan gladly accepted. The candidates were Yury Dmitrievich, the late Duke's brother, and the young Vasily Vasilievich, the late Duke's son. The latter had secured the support of the majority of tatar nobles, and thus the Khan decided in his favour.;x

Abu al-Hasan fell in love to the point of abandoning his former first wife, Aixa, daughter of Muhammad X. Aixa and her son Muhammad XII Boabdil, staged a coup with the help of her family and the Banu al-Sarraj. Abu al-Hasan fled with his supporters and continued fighting.

They were religious traditionalists and managed to split the arab nobility of Granada in two parties, the other led by the Banu Bannigas (Venegas) family. Their actions started a period of unstability and civil wars that no doubt contributed to the final demise of Granada.

But the truce conditions allowed for a low intensity frontier war, excluding sudden attacks upon towns and castles, provided they were mere forays, conducted furtively, without sound of trumpet or display of banners or pitching of camps or regular investment, and that they did not last above three days. These conditions ensured the survival of the frontier noblemen, castilian fronteros and grenadin zegries, that made a living out of the frontier war and were in charge of keeping the frontier safe even when central power was weak. But on occasions, the truce was violated by any of the sides. One such occasion was the invasion of Murcia by Abdalbar in the name of Muhammad IX in 1451.

EVENTHIST48001;Between 1515 and 1523 the Welfendukes were in constant warfare with the Bishop of Hildesheim and war parties of both sides ravaged the countryside. The feud started as the Bishop of Hildesheim tried to reform the financial situation of the diocese and bought off the land his predecessors mortgaged to independent knights. The Knights thus got a fixed amount of payment but lost the income of their estates and had to give up their independence. They refused to accept the repayment and cancellation of the mortgage contract and called the Dukes of Wolfenbüttel and Calenberg for help, who in turn took the leadership of the uprising.;x

EVENTNAME48002;The Feud is won;x
EVENTHIST48002;Although the Bishop of Hildesheim won with the aid of Duke Heinrich of Luneburg the only real battle of the Feud against Erich in 1519, the Dukes of Calenberg and Wolfenbüttel achieved the support of Emperor Charles V and the Electorat assembly. Heinrich of Luneburg was forced to cease his support for Hildesheim in 1521 and the isolated Bishop had to give up after two more years of fighting. The peace solution brought some territorial gain for Calenberg and Wolfenbüttel.;x

EVENTHIST48004;Between 1635 and 1637 Georg established a private permanent army and managed with Swedish aid to liberate the Welfenterritory from the Emperor's troops under Tilly. Later he took a neutral position between the Emperor and the Swedes and used his army to keep the heavy fighting off the country. His strategies were based upon defensive warfare supported by modern artillery. The army was the first permanent force in Luneburg, Calenberg and Wolfenbüttel and was kept in service to become the predecessor of the Hanoveranian army.;x

They eventually made a seperate peace with the emperor and thus missed the opportunity to expand their territory in the Westfalian peace.;x

EVENTNAME48006;The Claim for the Electorat;x
EVENTHIST48006;During the second half of the 17th century the lands of Calenberg and Luneburg were successively ruled by able leaders who managed to regain much of the former strength of the Welfen in the middle ages. As Duke Georg Wilhelm of Luneburg was childless and Ernst August of Hanover his only heir, the opportunity arised to reunite a great part of the Welfen realm. Against resistance within the family Duke Ernst August of Hanover introduced a new law of succession to the eldest son that should prevent further divisions. Yet he was outlived by Georg Wilhelm and the inheritance of Luneburg was to be achieved by his son Georg Ludwig in 1705. However the Emperor acknowledged the reestablished power of the Welfen in Northern Germany and offered to make them Electors on December 9th 1692. Yet the opposition of the older line of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel and the Elector of Saxony had to be dealt with. The Saxons could be convinced, but the Brunswickers managed to gain French support against Hanover.;x

EVENTHIST48015;In the personal Union of Hanover and England, it was agreed to keep separate budgets for both countries and the King was not allowed to shift Hanoveranian expenses to the English tax and vice versa. Yet King Georg I and King Georg II felt strong ties to Hanover and tried secretly to transfer some funds to the German administration and to pension of Hanoveranian officials with English money. As the Taxes collected in England were watched closely by the parliament, the King relied on the Irish Tax, which was not watched very closely.;x

EVENTHIST48024;Gerlach Adolph, Freiherr von Münchhausen was appointed to the Hanoveranian secret council in 1728 and dominated the Hanoveranian government for almost 50 years. He tried to keep an independent Hanoveranian diplomacy alive, but had to accept that most monarchs would rather communicate with the English ambassador. The most feared scenario was that a major European power could attack Hanover as revenge against an England that was out of reach. Against English plans, Münchhausen managed to avoid an alliance with the isolated Prussians and keep a neutral position in Germany up to the start of the seven years war.;x

EVENTNAME48025;William Pitt the Elder;x
EVENTHIST48025;As William Pitt kept a strong contempt for Hanover, England began to dominate Hanoveranian foreign relations to a point that threatend the mere existence of Hanover. He drove Hanover into an unhappy alliance with Prussia, but refused to send English reinforcements as the Hanoveranian army was left alone by the Prussians after Friedrich lost the battle of Kolin. Heavily outnumbered by a French invasion force, they had to withdraw and left most parts of Hanover under French occupation. When Pitt finally decided to send English troops after Friedrichs victory at Roßbach, the northern German army was under English control with a Prussian general and fought for English and Prussian aims, not for Hanover. The end of the war brought poverty and almost destruction to Hanover, but immense wealth and colonial power to England. In these days Hanoveranian sympathy for England was at low tide and King Georg II asked the Hanoveranian secret council if it was time to break the personal union.;x

EVENTNAME181000;The Electorate of Hanover;x
EVENTHIST181000;During his reign in the Calenberg part of Braunschweig-Lüneburg, Ernst August conducted an ambitious and determined policy, intending to rise to the ranks of the most powerful imperial princes. Since 1662 he was Prince Bishop of osnabrück and eventually he managed to inherit all possessions of the Lüneburg branch of Braunschweig, which secured a solid territorial base for his country that was further expanded by his successor's acquisition of the old archbishopric of Bremen. He maintained a strong standing army, conducted centralistic reforms and managed to introduce primogeniture, finally securing the country's unity. By successfully supporting him against the Ottomans and promising to always vote for the Habsburg candidate in imperial elections, he convinced Emperor Leopold to grant the electoral dignity to the house of Brunswick-Lüneburg that became thereafter known as the Electorate of Hanover.;x

EVENTNAME181003;Gotthold Ephraim Lessing;x
EVENTHIST331048;Gotthold Ephraim Lessing was one of the most influential figures of the Enlightenment in Germany and can be considered the father of the modern German theater and literary criticism. Born in Upper Lusatia in 1729, he came in contact with literature and philosophy at the university of Meissen. After working quite unsuccessfully as a playwright and literary critic in Leipzig, Berlin, Breslau and Hamburg, he finally got an office as librarian in Wolfenbüttel, paid by his patron, the Elector of Hanover. He was strongly influenced by classic poetry and dramaturgy and, especially, by Shakespeare and wanted German theater to follow these ideals instead of the French classical theater. While he tried to contribute to the establishment of a German national theater in Hamburg between 1766-1769 (which eventually failed), he wrote down his ideas of a drama true to the spirit of Aristotelian dramatic unities and devoted to spread the ideas of the Enlightenment in the Hamburgische Dramaturgie. According to him, the audience should be made to identify with the actors through pity and fear, and, witnessing the catastrophic outcome, be freed from unnatural desires and emotions. He opposed simple, unrealistic black-and-white characters and introduced more ambivalent personalities in his plays. Most of them were set in a middle-class environment and advocate the ideals of the burghers, thus following Lessing's idea of the Bürgerliches Trauerspiel. His most famous plays are Miss Sara Sampson (1755), Minna von Barnhelm (1763), Emilia Galotti (1772) and Nathan der Weise (1779), the last being the most prominent one due to its controversial plea for tolerance and religous freedom. Lessing was also important as a merciless and aggressive literary critic, the first who in a brillant way honestly expressed his opinion of contemporary literature.;x

EVENTHIST185003;Through his influence in Hanover, King of England, historically George III, acquired military aid of several German leaders in his war against the American colonists. About 30000 soldiers, mostly fresh conscripts, debtors, criminals and veterans of European wars, were sold into service by German monarchs, and they came to be called Hessians because more than half of this number were from Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel. Since Hesse-Kassel committed all its soldiers except the Landgrave's guard and its cavalry, the treaty also included a defensive alliance between England and Hesse-Kassel to ensure safety of the latter from its French neighbors.;x

EVENTHIST185004;Shipping of Hessian soldiers to aid the suppression of rebellion in English colonies in North America is probably the best known of Subsidien contracts which small German monarchies of the Holy Roman Empire signed to rent out their troops in order to maintain their disproportionately large armies. The original contract obliged Landgrave Friedrich II to sent 15 infantry regiments, 4 grenadier batallions and 2 jaeger companies, each accompanied by two light cannons, which made about 12500 soldiers in total. The contract assured that Hessian troops in English service could be used only in Europe and North America. After less than a year of engagements in North American colonies, the British were impressed with performance of Hessian jaegers, so the signed an extension of the contract with enlarged the forces rented out by Hesse-Kassel by 4 jaeger foot companies and one mounted company. The payment from this Subsidien came as a great relief to economy of Hesse-Kassel. The taxes were lowered substantially and the Landgraviate completely recovered from the Seven Years War and French occupation. The recruitment of troops provided a great demand for many goods, especially the textile industry.;x

Besides the Elector of Saxony, Philipp of Hessen became the most important and powerful protestant prince in the early years of the Reformation.

EVENTNAME3631;The Great Northern Conflict;x
EVENTHIST3631;In 1697, the 15 years old Charles XII ascended the Swedish throne. Seeing the opportunity, the Russian Czar Peter I allied with Denmark and Poland-Saxony in 1699. However, with British and Dutch naval assistance, Charles XII landed on Zealand and promptly defeated the Danes, then moved to Estland where his badly outnumbered Swedes (1 to 5) won a crushing victory over the Russians. Instead of finishing the Russians, Charles moved against August II of Poland-Saxony and drove him out of Poland in 1704 (having the pro-Swedish Stanislaw Leszczynski elected King), then subjugating Saxony in 1706. While the Russians started the construction of St-Petersburg (1703) and rebuilt their armies, they also took parts of Estland (1704-1706). Charles then decided to march to Moscow via the Ukraine where the Cossacks under Mazeppa had again risen in revolt (1708). The harsh winter and Russian raids decimated his army and he was finally beaten at the battle of Poltava in 1709. The wounded King escaped to the Ottomans. The Russians were encircled by the Ottomans on the Prut River, but Peter succeeded through bribery to obtain a safe conduct in exchange for Azov. While Charles was still exiled in Turkey, Russian, Danish, Hanoverian and even Prussian troops captured most of the Swedish territory around the Baltic. Having emerged from Turkish internment, Charles got killed in 1718 in front of the Norwegian fortress of Frederickshald. The peace treaties that followed Sweden lost most of her Baltic empire.;x

However, Jeanne died in June 1573 (thereby making Henry King of Navarre) while Coligny was gradually won over when he realised the marriage to Marguerite was necessary to achieve his plan for assisting his Dutch, coreligionists by making war on Spain.;x

From 11 February 1573, the siege was led by the Duke of Anjou (the future Henri III). The end of hostilities was brought on by the election (11 - 15 May 1573) of the Duke of Anjou to the throne of Poland. An end to the siege was negotiated on 24 June 1573 and the Catholic troops lifted the siege on 6 July 1573.

EVENTHIST3641;In 1604 Rudolf I (1552-1612) was intent on re-imposing Catholicism on the Hungarians, provoking their first popular insurrection against Habsburg rule. The insurrectionists found a leader in István Bocskai (1557--1606), prince of Transylvania in 1605 and 1606, who fused the popular forces with his own army. Already at war with the Turks, the Habsburgs now faced an uncompromising civil war. A threefold settlement was finally forced on the dynasty: the Treaties of Vienna and Zsitvatorok of 1606 and the legislation of the Hungarian diet of 1608. Together these secured for Hungary religious freedom, constitutional autonomy, and the right of habeas corpus.;x

While riding with his companions on a hunting trip, King Lajos fell off his horse after it was suddenly startled, causing him to break his neck. Lajos left no direct heir. The Diet, Hungary's Parliament, convened to decide who would be the dead King's successor. Two factions formed around the candidates who were most likely to succeed him. The first was Louis's brother-in-law, Ferdinand of Habsburg, and the other was János Zápolya of Transylvania. Ferdinand's claim was supported by Spain, Bohemia, England and the Papacy, while France, the Ottoman Empire, and Poland backed Zápolya.

Jagiello apparently agreed, but after the uproar in the Polish camp, he quickly rescinded his agreement and hastily left the meeting together with Polish nobles. Soon after, Jagiello offered Polish crown to Vytautas citing poor health and inability to rule, which Emperor Sigismund agreed to.

By 1461 the crusade had made no progress so Pius asked Mehmed II to convert. Since that didn't work either, he decided to lead the crusade himself despite being ill. France was at odds with the Pope, Burgundy delayed their help, Milan was trying to seize Genoa, and Florence cynically advised the Pope to let the Turks and the Venetians wear each other out. But the Venetians and the Hungarians signed their support in 1463. Thousands of destitute men from all of Europe came to the Pope's call and he led them to Ancona in the summer of 1464, where he became very ill. While waiting for the Venetian fleet, plague broke out and the crusade army melted away. On August 14, when the Venetians finally arrived, the Pope expired.

EVENTHIST188022;When the conflict between Loyalists, who supported the rightful infante King Ladislaus Postumus, son of late Emperor Albrecht I, and Nationalists who wanted to install Polish King Wladyslaw, Despot Djuradj was not in a position to choose sides. His daughter's marriage with Ulrich II of Cilli, leader of Loyalist faction, already made his decision for him. Although Djuradj wasn't in a position to offer much active support to Ulrich's faction, Count of Cilli still maintained good relationships with his father-in-law. Unable to help his son-in-law and also unable to win King Wladyslaw's favor, Despot Djuradj turned to Republics of Venice and Ragusa for help, but both refused. His flight to Venice antagonized both Hungarians and Ottomans. King Wladyslaw seized Djuradj's estates in Hungary, while the Ottoman Sultan blinded his sons Grgur, who lead the Serbian unit in Ottoman army, and Stevan who was captured when Smederevo fell to Turks. However, King Wladyslaw came to understand the threat Ottomans represented and the small but significant aid the buffer Despotate of Serbia can provide. After spending some time fighting for the Venetians in Zeta, Despot Djuradj traveled back to Hungary to make peace and alliance against Ottomans with the new King. He succeeded, aided by their joint fear of Turks and help of Janko Hunyadi, a Wallachian noble and the leader of Nationalists who also served in the army of Stefan Lazarevic.;x

Unlike King Wladyslaw, Janos Hunyadi failed to secure support of other Catholic monarchs and his vassals. The Pope refused to support Hunyadi's initiative until he settles his disputed with Emperor Friedrich III. Venice was too busy with their own problems both in the Balkans and in Italy, so they were more inclined to ally with Turks than to fight them. Aragonese King ignored Hunyadi's call for help completely. Djuradj Brankovic of Serbia, like in the Second Crusade, decided to stay neutral. Only Skanderbeg of Albania joined Hunyadi in his war. Hunyadi had an army of 70000, mostly cavalry, and met an even larger Turkish army lead by the Sultan himself.

They decided to pledge to protect Serbia against all her enemies, never to order their armies to pass through Serbia unless allowed to do so by Serbian Despot, to pay 100000 ducats of compensation and to return to Djuradj all his estates in Hungary except those that will be given to Hunyadi as dowry of Djuradj's granddaughter Jelisaveta, daughter of late Ulrich II of Cilli, who was to marry one of Hunyadi's sons.

EVENTHIST188030;Kingdom of Bosnia was a chaotic realms where dukes constantly battle each other for territories. The most famous rivalry of that age was between Pavlovic and Kosaca families. After a quiet period, the rivalry revived when Duke Radoslav Pavlovic attacked and defeated the Republic of Ragusa because they tried to turn Cavtat, a town they bought from him, into a fortress. Duke Sandalj Hranic Kosaca immediately intervened on Ragusan side and attacked his archrival. King Tvrtko II was mostly helpless to solve the dispute. Since Duke Sandalj had the support of the Ottomans, Duke Radoslav asked Despot Djuradj of Serbia to broker peace. At almost the same time, King Tvrtko II went to war with Zlatonosovic family in eastern Bosnia. Since they were friends of Duke Sandalj and Serbian Despot, King Tvrtko II decided to throw his lot with Duke Radoslav. A real civil war started in Bosnia. As Kings faction began to loose the war, treacherous Duke Radoslav switched sides and joined the Serbian Despot's camp in 1433. This coalition of Serbian Despot and Bosnian Dukes put forth their own candidate for Tvrtko's replacement: Radivoj. The hostilities temporarily ceased when Emperor Sigismund announced his support for King Tvrtko II and Despot Djuradj withdrew from the conflict. Hungarian army arrived as promised in 1434 and changed the tide of the battle. Coalition of rebellious Dukes was defeated and forts held by Ottomans liberated. Duke Sandalj was crushed by Duke Djuradj Vojsalic, who joined forces with King Tvrtko II when Hungarian army arrived, and died from illness in March 1435. King Tvrtko traveled to Hungary to swear vassalage to Emperor Sigismund. Upon his return to Bosnia, he started a campaign together with Duke Radoslav Pavlovic to destroy Stepan Vukcic, the new Duke Kosaca. King Tvtrko II was also aided by Croatian Princes Ivan and Stepan Frankopan who acted on the orders of Emperor Sigismund. Ottomans intervened on the behalf of Stepan Vukcic and reconquered one of the forts in Bosnia holding it against Hungarian troops until the end of the conflict. In 1436, Ivan Frankopan is denied the succession of the estates that belonged to his late father-in-law and switches sides to join Duke Stepan Vukcic. Hungarian army defeated and probably killed Ivan Frankopan. King Tvrtko II realized that he will not be able to expel the Turks from Bosnia and crush Stepan Vukcic, so he renewed his oath to Ottoman Sultan and reconciled with his enemy. Together with Stepan Vukcic and the Ottoman forces, the King turned on Duke Radoslav and utterly defeated him in 1438.;x

He died in November 1443 without a male heir, but he outlived Hermann of Cilli who was supposed to inherit Bosnia in such case. With Hungary loosing a war against Ottoman Empire, Emperor Albrecht I was not in a position to press the claims of Hermann's successors. The only two remaining choices were the two sons of Stefan Ostoja, Tvrtko's predecessor, Radivoj and Tomas. Just before his death, King Tvrtko II insisted that the treaty he signed with Hermann II be honored and that Count Ulrich of Cilli becomes King of Bosnia.;x

He later went to Padua where he became a friend of Galeotto Marzio - Mantegna painted a portrait of the two which has unfortunately been lost. Pannonius' sharp witted poetry like 'One for Pope Paul': 'Rome, do not ask for the Pontiff Paul to be testicle-tested!/ Isn't his daughter herself manly enough, like her Dad?' made him famous throughout Italy. Pannonius earned his doctorate in 1458 and returned to Hungary to serve as personal secretary to King Mattias Corvinus. In 1459 he became Bishop of Pécs. He devoted most of his time as Bishop to political writings. He was later appointed Head Chamberlain to the Queen and then sent to Rome to consult with the Pope about the Turkish threat. In 1468 he accompanied the King on his war in Morava and around 1470 he was made Palatine in charge of southern Hungary and Slavonia. The King, however, soon distanced himself from Janus which caused the poet to join a conspiracy against the King which was quickly quashed. Pannonius died in the castle of his friends the Brothers Thuz near Zagreb. King Corvinus then collected his poetry for inclusion in the King's library - the Corvinae.;x

EVENTNAME188090;The Vacant Throne;x
EVENTHIST188101;In 1439 Albrecht of Habsburg, King of Hungary, fell ill, probably of cholera, while campaigning against the Ottomans. Within one month he died, leaving two minor daughters and his pregnant wife Elizabeth. For the case of the unborn child being male, Albrecht declared that his son would be his successor in all his fiefs just before his death. Based on this will, Elizabeth attempted to get the Parliament to appoint her Queen Regent for her unborn baby. Still feeling menaced by the Ottomans, a majority of the Diet consisting mostly of the middle and lower nobility however did not want to trust the country's fortune upon a woman and an unborn child and, led by the Transylvanian noble Janos Hunyadi, desired an adult King with a decent powerbase instead. It was Hunyadi who proposed the most obvious choice, Wladyslaw III, King of the other big Christian Kingdom in East Europe, Poland. Initially with the consent of Elizabeth, deputies of the Diet approached the nineteen-year-old Wladyslaw in Krakow and offered him the Hungarian crown. Meanwhile, Elizabeth gave birth to a son, the male heir Albrecht and she had hoped for, and called him Ladislaus. Since then, she was determined to secure the throne for her child and thus withdrew her approval of the offer to the Polish King. But instructed by Hunyadi and other magnates, negotiations continued. When Wladyslaw eventually accepted the proferred throne on March 8th 1440 and everything seemed ready for his coronation and the union of the two Kingdoms, Elizabeth fled Hungary to Austria with her son and the stolen Holy crown of Hungary. She had Ladislaus crowned King in Székesfehérvár on May 1st, more than two months before Wladyslaw's coronation on July 17th. The scene was set for a civil war between the supporters of Elizabeth and Ladislaus, called 'Loyalists' who were strongest in Western Hungary and Slovakia and championed by Ulrich of Cilli on the one side and the supporters of Wladyslaw, the 'Nationalists', based largely in the East and Transylvania and led by Janos Hunyadi, on the other.;x

With Emperor Friedrich V lacking the energy and ability to continue the efforts for the crown of St. Stephen, the Pope encouraging a settlement that would allow for a Hungarian crusade against the Ottomans and fortune in battle against the supporters of Ladislaus, the succession conflict in Hungarian was practically ended by this.

EVENTHIST188096;When on November 10th 1444 King Ulászló was killed in the battle of Varna against the Ottomans and Janos Hunyadi merely escaped alive, Hungary was plunged into another crisis. Succession of the dead King was unclear, a huge part of the Hungarian nobility had died in the battle, many magnates were glad to have no central authority over them. Austria, reviving Ladislaus Postumus' claim on Hungary, occupied the Hungarian border districts, Jan Jiskra seized Spis and the Cilli family took control of Slovakia, driving out the supporters of Ulászló I.

EVENTNAME188097;The National Diet of 1445;x
EVENTHIST188097;When the country was about to disintegrate, Janos Hunyadi took the initiative and managed to convene a NationalDiet in April 1445. The measure of the crisis can be judged by the fact that for the first time ever Hungarian Towns were represented. Pointing out the necessity of united action against the Ottomans, Hunyadi achieved a settlement. The former supporters of Ulászló acknowledged Ladislaus Postumus as rightful King and the Diet demanded Emperor Friedrich V to turn over Ladislaus, who was kept in Vienna, and the Holy Crown of St. Stephen to the Hungarian people. Until the return of Ladislaus seven 'Captains' elected by the Diet were to rule the country and to restore law and order. Hunyadi was the first and most powerful of these Captains and five of the rest were his supporters. Only the final man to make up the seven was not one of his choice. The Hussite mercenary captain Jan Jiskra had built such a strong base in Slovakia and surrounding districts that he could not be ignored if the Diet and Hunyadi did not want to have to fight him immediately. Despite the balance of power being firmly in favour of Hunyadi and his peers this temporary solution worked very well. Even most of the magnates who had been hostile towards Ulászló and Hunyadi did at this time not want to risk the Kingdom's very existance. In the following year, peace was maintained and relative stability restored.;x

EVENTHIST188098;The settlement achieved at the National Diet of 1444 was quite successful in stabilising the country, but the Captains managed neither to get Friedrich V to release Ladislaus Postumus nor to recover control over the parts of Upper Hungary seized by Jan Jizkra who refused to cooperate despite being one of the seven captains. A more permanent solution was needed and a new diet summoned at Pest in June 1446. Hunyadi's supporters among the populace and the lesser nobility very vocally demanded his appointment as Royal Regent, leaving the Diet with little choice, and Hunyadi was elected Gubernator of Hungary for as long as it would take to free Ladislaus, deliberately passing over the Palatine László Garai. The other magnates, distrustful of Hunyadi who had risen from a country squire to the most important person in Hungary within ten years, and envying him for his power and popularity, managed to install several limitations on Hunyadi's authority. A regency council, composed mostly of opponents of Hunyadi, was to 'assist' him in his duties, Garai stayed Palatine and kept some power and themagnates during the regency used every opportunity to resist Hunyadi and stall his measures. Nevertheless Hunyadi at the same Diet and another in 1447 got a whole series of popular reforms passed, e.g. the decree ordering the demolition of the new castles, most of them little better than robber-strongholds, the decree compelling the great officers of state to suspend their functions during the session of the diet, the decree declaring illegal the new fashion of forming confederations afterthe Polish model, all of which measures were obviously directed against the tyranny and the lawlessness of the oligarchy. Due to the resistance of the magnates and wars against the Ottomans and Jizkra, most of these measures remained dead letter, but still some of them had the intended effect.;x

EVENTNAME188099;Crusade against the Turks;x
EVENTHIST188099;After King Wladyslaw managed to pacify the opposition Hungary, he turned his attention to the Ottoman Empire. At the same time, this problem was brought more closely into the attention of other Christian powers. Knights of Saint John, remnants of the Byzantine Empire and Republic of Ragusa were the most active in demands for coordinated offensive against the Turks. The dynastic civil war in Ottoman Empire made these initiatives sound more realistic than before. Pope's first reaction was to send Cardinal Julian Cesarini to aid the pacification of Wladyslaw's opponents in Hungary. Between Cesarini's splendid efforts and Hunyadi's great military leadership, Hungary was more ready for war than ever. Hunyadi won his first crushing vicotory against an invading Ottoman army in Hungary in 1442, and already in 1443 he broke the 80000-strong Ottoman army in Wallachia. These victories and the news of Ottoman defeat against Karaman greatly emboldened the Christian monarchs. Just after Hunyadi's victory in Wallachia, the Pope decided to aid the war effort with a fifth of his annual income. In June 1443, an army of 25,000 with focus on cavalry headed south to attack the Ottomans in Serbia. The army was lead by King Wladyslaw himself and his most loyal vassals: Janos Hunyadi, Djuradj Brankovic and Dracul. In November, Janos Hunyadi lead the charge of 12000 Hungarian knights that completely broke the Ottoman army near Nis. Sofia fell to Christian forces in December. The winter stop the Christian invasion and tired Hungarian soldiers returned to their Kingdom in January 1444. Invasion resumed in June 1444, aided by a fleet made of Venetian and Papal galleys, with Burgundian fleet on its way.;x

Despite the magnates' hostility towards his family and several foreign candidates, there was overwhelming popular support for the only surviving son of Janos Hunyadi whose deeds were kindly remembered, Mathias. The 17-year-old had apparently inherited his father's talents in full measure. Besides, his uncle Mihály Szilâgyi had quickly assumed control of the country at the head of 15,000 veterans who had served under Janos Hunyadi. On January 24th 1458, 40,000 Hungarian nobles assembled on the frozen ice of the Danube and unanimously elected Mathias, who soon received the surname 'Corvinus' from the raven on his escutcheon, King of Hungary.;x

He found excellent material for this new army in the troops of the Hussite mercenaries Jan Vitovec and Jan Jizkra who had seized Hungarian lands during the reign of Ladislaus Postumus. By making them Hungarian nobles and army commanders, he achieved a settlement with them, recovering the lands and taking most of their men into his service. Of these troops who had been trained in the most modern Hussite tactics he formed the 'Fekete Sereg' (Black Brigade), named after the colour of its armour, an elite troop of 6000 soldiers that was to become the backbone of his army.;x

EVENTHIST188113;In 1459 Mathias Corvinus began ambitious reforms of the Hungarian army that he intended to make equal to the Ottoman and Hussite military by implementing modern tactics and organization. Instead of relying on the feudal banderia, he created permanent forces. Besides his elite troops, the Black Brigade and the Hussars, from 1465 on he created a large standing army by enlistment in Hungary and Croatia. This army was efficiently organized, led by a regular commissariat and provided with canons and ballistic machines. It did not only provide Corvinus with military power for his numerous campaigns, but also served as a police force and a civilizing medium, forcefully suppressing the lawlessness of the Hungarian nobility and collecting taxes from defiant nobles.;x

EVENTHIST188114;During his reign, Mathias Corvinus quite significantly changed the Hungarian state and society. He managed to increase the royal income dramatically by making the poorer members of the Diet who were unable to attend it regularly agree to grant taxes several years in advance, outmaneuvering the high nobility, by establishing a regular, functional system of tax collection and by having the treasury administered by specialists with separate functions. Instead of trying to impose much-needed reforms without the consent of the Diet, he managed to reach an agreement with most of the deputies, especially of the lower nobility and the towns, so that he could pass 450 new statutes in a fully legal, unquestionable way. In these statutes, he codified and modernized Hungarian law and state organization. Several laws protected the towns and peasantry from encroachments of the higher classes, he tried to introduce a jurisdiction judging irrespective of status and simplified almost all branches of law, which gained him the epithet of 'the Just'. A new official class, appointed only by ability and merit, helped him enact these policies.;x

He obtained the approval of Pope Paul II in 1465 and the Academia Istropolitana - Istropolis is the latin name of Preporok - was officially opened on July 20th 1467.

Matthias Corvinus gladly welcomed these refugees and let them settle in the southern border districts. Since they were outside Hungarian laws for troop raising, they made for a new reliable army at the hands of the King. The new levy of soldiers based on the refugee Serbs became an impressive light cavalry force, used mainly for raids and counter-raids against the Ottomans and Austria, but also very useful in battle, that was soon known as Hussars. In the following centuries, the Hussars were the world's most famous and respected cavalry units. The Serb refugees were also of immense value for the defense of the Hungarian border.;x

Pope Pius II, determined to fight Hussitism, condemned Podiebrad's heretic attitude more and more vocally and encouraged an uprising of the catholic nobility in 1465. In order to back the rebels and depose Podiebrad, Pius' successor Paul II excommunicated the Bohemian King on December 23rd 1466, released all his subjects from their oaths of allegiance and searched for a reliably catholic prince who would drive him away and take the Bohemian throne.

Despite Polish support for Bohemia, no side eventually managed to gain the upper hand: while Matthias failed in all his attempts to invade Bohemia proper and was threatened by Hungarian rebels and Friedrich III, the lands of the Bohemian crown, Silesia, Moravia and Lusatia, were almost completely occupied by him and could, despite several determined attacks, never be recovered. Realizing this, and desiring to secure their positions, both parties agreed on a peace in Olmütz which came into effect in 1478. By the treaty, Corvinus was to retain the lands of the Bohemian crown until his death when Bohemia could buy them back for 400.000 Florins and was allowed to style himself King of Bohemia in these lands, but gave up his claim on the rest of Bohemia.;x

EVENTHIST188121;About a decade after the treaty of Sopron that had concluded their first clash, the conflict between Mathias Corvinus and Emperor Friedrich III was sparked again by several relatively minor incidents. Both were deeply distrustful of each other, Friedrich accusing Mathias of maintaining a secret agreement with the Ottomans and letting their raiding troops pass through Hungarian lands for their invasions of Austria. When Mathias was still fighting Vladislav Jagiello of Bohemia to gain the Bohemian throne - that he had been promised by the Pope -, Friedrich formally recognized Vladislav as King of Bohemia and elector of the Holy Roman Empire. The rivaly deteriorated into a personal feud after Friedrich in 1477 had given sanctuary to one of Mathias' advisors, Johann Beckenschlager, the Archbishop of Esztergom, who had left Hungary because of a disagreement with Corvinus. This caused Mathias to invade Austria and siege Vienna, which made Friedrich grudgingly accept a truce by which he acknowledged Corvinus as Bohemian King and promised to abandon his support for Beckenschlager. However only two years later Friedrich got Beckenschlager elected Archbishop of Salzburg. Mathias decided this provocation was too much, and began a determined invasion of Austria and Styria with the goal to humiliate Friedrich and expand his territory.;x

However Mathias died of a stroke before the matter was definitely secured, and the young, inexperienced Janos was soon deprived of his rights and his property by the Hungarian magnates who were fed up with the strong central rule introduced by Mathias and desired a monarch 'whose beard they could hold in their fists'. Such a candidate was found in Vladislav Jagiello, King of Bohemia since 1471. Called 'King All Right' by his Bohemian subjects because of his weakness, irresoluteness and saying yes to everything, obviously completely incompetent for ruling a Kingdom and having already initiated a rapid decline of Bohemia, he was the easily controllable puppet King the magnates were looking for. Vladislav was elected King on July 5th 1490 and immediately thereafter accepted the compact of Farkashida in which he confirmed all existing privileges of the nobility and took back all legal and administrative reforms, including the efficient system of taxation regarded as repressive by the magnates. After 3 decades of prosperity and modernisation, the election of Vladislav initiated a rapid decline, ending up in the disaster of Mohacs. Another candidate to the throne was Maximilian of Habsburg who maintained the claim of his father Friedrich III, but since he had already proven to be a capable ruler and would have been likely to use his powerbase in the Empire, Austria and Burgundy to consolidate his authority in Hungary, he was no popular choice.

EVENTNAME188600;The Hussite Wars;x
EVENTHIST188600;The Czech priest and professor Jan Hus developed radical reformatory demands on the base of the teachings of John Wyclif. Despite a guarantee of safe-conduct by Emperor Sigismund, he was executed at the stake for heresy at the Council of Constance in 1415. This could however not stop the Hussite movement in Bohemia. Hus' followers were rapidly growing, and when King Vaclav IV of Bohemia died and his brother Sigismund, already Emperor and King of Hungary was to succeed him, they, unwilling to forgive him the betrayal of Hus and afraid that he would suppress them, refused to acknowledge him and gained control of most of Bohemia proper - while the lands of the Bohemian crown and the catholic part of Bohemia accepted Sigismund. Due to its radical anti-clerical and anti-feudal tendencies Hussitism posed a big threat to the church and nobility in the countries adjacent to Bohemia. Several German and European princes therefore decided to oppose the Hussites and to support Sigismund in his struggle with them that lasted for almost two decades. Should we decide to fight these heretics, we should be aware that this would be internationally regarded as an intervention in favour of Sigismund as rightful King of Bohemia rather than a war of conquest, and that therefore, if Sigismund prevails and manages to restore royal authority, we would be expected to turn over any conquests in Bohemia to the Kingdom of Bohemia.;x

The brutal internal war cost many lives and weakened the Hussites substantially. A decisive battle at Malesov on June 7th 1424 was won by the Hussites.

EVENTHIST401008;Since Emperor Sigismund remained unyielding and refused to seriously negotiate a compromise with the Hussites when Prokop the Great tried to approach him in 1429, Prokop convinced an assembly of the Hussite leadership to resort to the force of arms. All factions - Taborites, Orebites, Praguers and Utraquists - had to contribute to 5 new armies that were quickly mustered, numbering about 40000 men and 5000 cavalry, and an invastion of the German territories of Saxony and Lusatia, strongholds of the Hussites' Romanists enemies, was launched.;x

EVENTNAME401009;Battle of Lipany;x
EVENTHIST401009;Both parties having realized that it was impossible to achieve a complete victory by military force, Hussites and catholics started negotiations for a compromise at the Council of Basel in 1433. The more radical members of the Hussite delegation, especially its leader Prokop Holý, and the unbending representants of the Roman Church who were reluctant to tolerate what they considered heresy however prevented an agreement. Thus the Hussite delegates returned to Bohemia in 1433, accompanied by a deputation of the Council. While the Taborites resumed the fighting and began to siege Plzen, the deputation of the council approached the leaders of the moderate Hussite nobles, called Utraquists. The Utraquists were hostile towards the radicality and the democratic tendencies of the Taborites and Orebites, hence a national diet sitting in Prague which was dominated by them agreed to the 'compactata', four articles that recognized the main demands of the Hussites in January 1434. This agreement was inacceptable to the Taborites and Orebites, and a civil war for power in Bohemia ensued. An army of the nobles commanded by Divis Borek z Miletinka met the army of Prokop Holý and Prokupek at Lipany near Prague on May 30th 1434. The Utraquists were numerically superior and had a skillful commander in Borek, hence when the Taborite cavalry under Capek ze San fled the battlefield, possibly deliberately betraying their side, the fate of the Taborites and Orebites was sealed. The Utraquist heavy horse annihilated them almost to the last man, and almost all their leaders including the two Prokops were killed. This battle basically eliminated the radical Hussites as a political force in Bohemia and opened up the way for a settlement between the moderates and Sigismund. However had the cavalry not fled, this could have become Prokop's greatest victory and allowed his followers to take control of Bohemia and keep on defying the church and Sigismund...;x

On July 5th a Bohemian diet assembled at the Moravian town of Jihlava (or Iglau) accepted the 'compactata', four articles containing concessions to the religious demands of the Hussites that had found the consent of the Council of Basel, subjected themselves to the authority of the council and the Church and acknowledged Zikmund as King of Bohemia.

Albeit militarily successful against King Zikmund's and the Church's attempts to subdue them by force, Bohemia is now threatening to fall into anarchy. At this point, the most charismatic figure of the Utraquist faction, Jiri z Podiebrad, decides that Bohemia and his confession can only be saved if he manages to get himself elected King and take up the reins of government. While the idea of establishing a national dynasty on the Bohemian throne is quite popular, it also meets strong resistance: lots of Utraquists would hate to see their power limited by a new King, and thus prefer turning Bohemia into an aristocratic republic with almost non-existant central authority.;x

EVENTNAME401021;Raids to Upper Hungary;x
EVENTHIST401021;The influence of Hussite teachings was not restricted to only Bohemia. Hussite preachers, mostly radical Taborites and Orebites, infiltrated all neighbouring territories. While their impact in German lands was mostly minimal, they had notable success in the Kingdom of Hungary, where the enserfed peasantry was receptive to their proto-communist ideas, and even more so among the Slovak peasantry in Upper Hungary. When in 1428 Hussite armies began systematic raids of Upper Hungary, the slowly growing Hussite community in Slovakia provided them with some support which allowed them to effectively control large parts of Upper Hungary until 1434.;x

EVENTHIST81001;As Viracocha and his heir fled, a young prince by the name of Inca Yupanqui, summoned warriors to defend the town of Cuzco from invading Chanca armies. Most of the Inca recruits sensing that the battle was hopeless, did not participate and instead gathered and watched. The tide of battle swiftly turned, however, when Inca Yupanqui went straight for the Chanca idol, capturing it. When the spectators saw the Chanca armies panic, they instantly joined the Inca side. This victory earned the young prince the title 'Pachacuti', which means Lord Cataclysm. It sparked a spree of conquest that would continue until the death of Huayna Capac, some 90 years later.;x

Pachacuti literally evacuated the town of Cuzco to rebuild it into the spiritual headquarters of the empire. One way in which he did this, was to take the 'huacas', or holy objects, from the nations he conquered and moved them to Cuzco, where Inca priests revered them. But at the same time these holy objects were in a sense held hostage, to discourage their respective worshippers from revolting. But perhaps his greatest achievement was the impressive fortress of Sacsahuaman located in the capital of Cuzco. This Massive fortress required 20,000 men 30 years to complete. Ironically though, this same fortress would help the Spanish defend their hold on the city from Inca insurgents less than a hundred years later...;x

EVENTHIST193802;In 1805, following Bonaparte's assumption of the title of Emperor of the French, the Italian Republic was transformed into the Kingdom of Italy (Regno d'Italia), with Napoléon as King and his stepson Eugène de Beauharnais as Viceroy. The 'Corona Ferrea' or the 'Iron Crown of the Lombards' (still nowadays kept in Monza's Dome, a city near Milan) so called from a narrow band of iron within it, said to be beaten out of one of the nails used at the Crucifixion, was worn for the last time in history by Charles V of Habsburg when he was crowned Holy Roman Emperor and King of Italy by the Pope Clemens VII at Bologna in 1530. On 26 May 1805 in a ceremony arranged in Milan's Dome Napoléon crowned himself King of Italy and said the ritual words: 'God gave it to me, woe to him who touches it'. These were the words spoken for the first time by Charlemagne when he received the crown as King of the Lombards in 774.;x

EVENTNAME3877;Hideyoshi's Anti-Christian Edict;x
EVENTHIST3877;In 1587, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who had already consolidated his hold over central Japan in the wake of Oda Nobunaga's murder, seized control of Kyushu, the main stronghold of Japanese Christianity. Alarmed at the possible undermining of authority that Christianity could cause, he proceeded to issue an edict that technically expelled the Jesuit missionaries from Japan, although in reality they were permitted to continue operating so long as they maintained a low profile. He also forced many important Daimyo to renounce their new faith. However, despite this, the number of Christian converts continued rising to a peak of about 300,000.;x

A series of mounting conflicts with the Portuguese, the possibility of trading with the Dutch, and alarm at the spread of Christianity in the Land of the Gods resulted in an Edict of Expulsion for the Jesuit missionaries. The Tokugawa regime then began persecuting the estimated 300,000 Japanese Christians using torture and execution as their primary instruments. This eventually helped to prompt the Shimabara peasant rebellion in Kyushu in 1638 in which about 30,000 overtaxed peasants rebelled, but were eventually massacred. If the Tokugawa regime had instead extended toleration to Christianity, then in Kyushu Catholicism may have eventually emerged as the dominant religion.;x

EVENTNAME3880;Policy of Sakoku implemented;x
EVENTHIST3880;Because of the political consolidation of Japan, antagonism of the ruling elite towards Christianity, and general disdain for the southern Barbarians as Europeans were termed, the Tokugawa regime in the 1630s began to implement the policy of Sakoku, or the Closed Country. The Merchant Marine was disbanded, no large ocean-going ships were allowed, and foreign travel was prohibited. This culminated in the final Sakoku edict of 1639 that banned all trade with Europeans except for a small Dutch factory at Nagasaki. Japan then turned inward for the next two centuries. However, if Japan had maintained closer contacts with the West by tolerating Christianity or getting itself deeply involved with situations in East Asia, then this policy of isolation would never had occurred.;x

The Japanese mounted two invasions in 1592 and 1597, but both failed, largely as a result of the efforts of the Korean Admiral Yi.

Mochikuni had originally adopted his nephew Hatakeyama Masanaga as his heir, when his biological son Yoshinari was born shifted Mochikuni changed his mind. This widened a split in the Hatakeyama family that was caused by the division of land of Akamatsu Mitsusuke's land.The resulting conflict was made worse by the fact that the Hatakeyama are one of three noble families that have the right to be the Kanrei of Yamashiro, the Hosokawa and the Shiba being the other two, and therefore wield considerable power as the highest officials in the Bakufu. The fighting has been been made worse by the involvement of the two other major families in Nippon, the Yamana and the Hosokawa. Both the Yamana and the Hosokawa have asked for permission to chastise the other clan for the involvement.

However, one year later Tomi-ko, Yoshimasa's wife, had a child. This put Yoshimi in an awkward position, though he remained as heir apparant to Yoshimasa. This infuriated Tomi-ko and and she sought the support of Yamana Sozen who envied Hosokawa and had been looking for some time for a legitimate reason to attack Hosokawa.

To Yamana's infuriation Hosokawa was merely reprimanded. That evening Yamana moved against Hosokawa by conducting Yoshimi to the Bakufu headquarters and began preparations to defend it. Seeing this, Hosokawaw also mobilized his troops into a defensive position within the city.\n Yoshimasa realized what a battle in Kyoto would mean and in an attempt to forestall the bloodshed within Kyoto he forebade them from interfering in the Hatakeyama succession as well as that whichever side attacked first would be branded a rebel. Even as powerless as the Ashikaga shogunate was, this threat was large enough to scare the men from attacking immediatly as being branded a rebel would alinate his allies and give cause for anyone to attack and freely cofiscate his lands without punishment.;x

EVENTNAME242007;The Breaking of Kyoto;x
EVENTHIST242007;While neither side wanted to be branded a rebel, both Yamana and Hosokawa maintained their positions. Flurries of letters and strengthening of battlements went on throughout spring. Finally in May of 1467 Hosokawa attacked the mansion of one of Yamana's generals, Isshiki. Even though Yoshimasa had earlier declared whoever started the fighting would be branded a rebel, Yamana was branded as one likely because of major contributions by Hosokawa. Fighting continued for several days and many buildings were destroyed in the process and fires spread. This however was only a prelude of what was to come for within less than half a year over 90 percent of Kyoto was destroyed.\n 'The flowery capital that we thought would last forever to our surprise is to become the lair of wolves and foxes. In the past their have been rebellions and disasters, but in the first year of the Onin war the laws of gods and Kings are broken and all the sects are perishing.' - Bakufu official, after the war;x

The Laws for Temples and Shrines which attempted to control mainly Buddhism sects were issued in 1612-1615 as part of them. The shogunate also introduced Terauke system which made all subjects be forced to register for a Buddhism temple to control them easily and Honmatsu system which submit all temples and shrines to an ossified hierarchy system.

EVENTNAME242040;Keicho Embassy;x
EVENTHIST242040;Date Masamune, a powerful daimyo in the Tohoku region, planned to send a mission to establish friendly relations with European countries (some people advocates that he attempted to make an alliance with Spain to overthrow the shogunate). He got the permission to do it from the shogunate and appointed his vassal Hasekura Tsunenaga as the ambassador with around 180 followers. The mission, called Keicho Embassy from the era name, set sailed from Ishinomaki on 15 September 1613. Their Japanese-built galleon visited via Mexico to Spain where Tsunenaga met Felipe III of Spain to ask him a trade agreement in 1615. They stayed on the town of Coria del Rio near Sevilla for a few months, and even today there are a few hundreds of residents using the surname 'Japon', considered as their descendants. The same year, Tsunenaga managed to be received in audience by Pope Paulus V in Rome. However, he wasn't able to conclude any agreement with them because of the shift in the shogunate's policy. At that time, Japan was moving toward to the closed-door policy and increasing oppression against Christianity. Tsunenaga returned to Japan via Luzon after his seven years fruitless trip and died in 1622. Although he was the first Japanese official ambassador to the Americas and Rome (and arguably Europe), his achievements were ignored until 19th century.;x

EVENTNAME242041;Tensho Boys Mission;x
EVENTHIST242041;In 1582, three Christian daimyos (Arima, Omura, and Otomo) in the Kyushu region were persuaded to send Japanese Christian teenagers to Europe by Jesuit Alessandro Valignano. The first purpose of it was to get support to their mission from European countries, the second was to bring up capable Japanese priests. They chose four excellent noblemen called Ito Mancio, Chijiwa Miguel, Nakaura Julian and Hara Martino for the envoy, called Tensho Embassy or Tensho Boys Mission from the era name. Arriving at Lisbon in 1584, they visited the cities including Madrid, Rome, Venice, Verona, and Milan. They were welcomed by European authorities among them were Felipe II of Spain and Francesco I of Tuscany. In addition, they became the first Japanese who were gave an audience with Pope, Gregory XIII. They also attended at the coronation of Pope Sixtus V of 1585. Returning to Japan, they met with Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1591. Although they were ordained as the first Japanese priests in 1608 (except Miguel who converted back in 1601), they couldn't accomplish their goal as Japan turned into anti-Christian policies. Martino left some influential works including the Japanese translation of 'Imitatio Christi' but he was expelled from the country and died in Macao in 1629. Julian became a martyr in Nagasaki in 1633 (374 years after that, Pope Benedict XVI did beatification of him in 2007). In a large sense, their most important exploit was publishing of printed Japanese books for the first time by using letterpress printing machines which they had brought back from Europe. Today, these books in existence are regarded as valuable historical materials for linguistic research.;x

EVENTNAME242042;Restoring relations with Korea;x
EVENTHIST242042;After Japanese invasions of Korea, it had been stalemate in their relations for a while. However, the new shogunate of Japan had been very interested in foreign trade while Korea had been threatened by expanding Manchus of the north. In addition, the daimyo of Tsushima islands which located in the middle of the strait had been very eager to resume their profitable intermediate trade. Thus, their interests ran together and they began to seek to restore relations with each other. Historically, Korea sent an envoy to Japan to restore their relations officially in 1607. They would become to exchange emissaries on suitable occasions following two centuries as they used to do during the Muromachi period. A Japanese trading post was also built at Pusan which became to be prospered as one of the few ports that Japanese merchants could carry on overseas trade: They primarily traded Japanese silver, gold, and sulfur and imports from South-east Asia for Chinese high quality silk and cloths at there.;x

EVENTNAME242043;Shakushain's Revolt;x
EVENTHIST242043;This large-scale revolt was a final attempt by Ainu (the natives of Ezochi, today's Hokkaido) to preserve their political independence. Since the late of 16th century, the Matsumae clan, local rulers of the area of Ezochi then controlled by Japanese, had been given the monopoly in the trade between Japanese and Ainu at there. The clan had used their position to make an unfair profit by which the natives had came to be deeply disaffected. Eventually on June 1669, Ainu tribes throughout the region which had been opposed to each other were now united in a rebellion against Japanese under the leadership of Shakushain, a charismatic Ainu chieftain. Although they fought fiercely, losing their leaders to battles and assassinations they were suppressed by 1672. After that, the Matsumae clan and the shogunate pursued more cruel oppression and disorganization on their local community. They would never see such a serious trouble until 1789.;x

EVENTNAME242044;Menashi-Kunashir Rebellion;x
EVENTHIST242044;The shogunate had been well aware of the threat of the Russian advance toward the Pacific Ocean since the early of 18th century. In 1789, growing dissatisfaction of Ainu (the natives of Ezochi) with high-handed ways of Japanese merchants led to a rebellion in eastern Ezochi. The shogunate ruthlessly quashed them and then exploited the incident for strengthening its control over there. By 1809, whole of Ezochi became to be directly ruled by the shogunate.;x

Portuguese Jesuits who had been taking into confidence of the government insisted to execute the crews as pirates because they wanted to keep Protestants away from Japan. However, Tokugawa Ieyasu accepted them as advisors for foreign affairs because of his much interest in the international situation. They contributed to the development of relations with Netherlands and England, thereby weakening the influence of Spain and Portugal. Adams also supervised building of several western-style ships. He was rewarded with estate in the Miura Peninsula and he came to call himself Miura Anjin (the pilots of Miura) as a samurai. He lived in Japan until his death in 1620. Jan Joosten was also granted a house in Edo. The area came to be called 'Yayosu' which derived from Japanese pronunciation of his name and the place-name still exists as 'Yaesu', the east side of the Tokyo Station today. He sunk on his way to Indonesia in 1623.;x

EVENTNAME242047;A plan of expedition to Luzon;x
EVENTHIST242047;Japan is thought to attempt to invade of Luzon at least three times during 16-17th centuries: Toyotomi Hideyoshi is the possible first person to conceive of it next to Korea, alarmed at European activities from the late 1580s. But the plan ended up with his death in 1598. The second was Matsukura Shigemasa, a minor daimyo of the Shimabara domain in Kyushu. He oppressed Christianity so intensely that he prepared to conquer Luzon which was believed that missionaries made their base. He also desired to dominate profitable trade on there. To set the plan into action, he burdened his subjects heavily, bribed high officials, and even dispatched reconnaissance officers in 1630. However, his ambition went into the dumper with his sudden death shortly after the dispatch. Some have advocated he was poisoned by officials of the shogunate who resented to be involved in any overseas troubles or exposed their corruption. The last was the shogunate itself in the 1630s. It suffered on both masterless samurais and persistent missionaries so that another expedition emerged as a practical option. But the Shimabara rebellion in 1637 forced the shogunate to concentrate on domestic issues and to abandon the plan for good. \n \n Now that we have achieved supremacy over the expanded realm, some militants press to carry the plan into effect while others question about the cost-effectiveness of it.

EVENTNAME242048;Reductions in foreign trade;x
EVENTHIST242048;Since the 1610s, Japan had been more cautious about foreigner especially Catholic missionaries who would bring unstable factors into the realm. Helped by the decrease of demands for foreign arms with the end of the war-torn era, the shogunate determined to restrict ports for trade with European to two (Nagasaki and Hirado) in 1616. Following that English merchants withdrew from Japan by 1623, losing out to Dutch competitors. The shogunate also interrupted relations with Spain in 1624, resenting to its religious tendencies. As a result, Japan's thriving foreign trade began to contract.;x
#;x
EVENTNAME242049;The Sakoku edict of 1635;x
EVENTHIST242049;This edict is regarded as a prime example of the Japanese desire for seclusion: As more high officials of the shogunate had begun to focus to consolidate their regime, they had become to resent being involved in foreign affairs. This change was accelerated by the incident in 1628 in which a Spanish warship destroyed a Japanese Red Seal Ship in Ayutthaya. The shogunate determined to strengthen the isolationist policy, considering that such an accident caused by free trade would escalate into an unwilling international war. The Sakoku edict of 1635 was issued as the third of a series from 1623 to 1651, following the abolishment of the Red Seal Ship trade system in 1633. With the edict, the Japanese were to be prohibited completely from leaving and returning their country, Catholicism was strictly forbidden, and foreign trade was restricted as to set limit the ports open to trade (Nagasaki, Tsushima, Ryukyu, and Ezochi).;x

They levied heavy duties on subjects to build a new castle, bribe high officials, and prepare an expedition to the Luzon regardless of their ability to pay. They also cracked down on Christianity so obsessively as to devise new tortures by themselves. On December 1637, this finally led to the Shimabara Rebellion, the largest revolt during the shogunate era in which about 30,000 peasants helped by masterless samurais rebelled against the ruler, Matsukura Katsuie. He failed to deal with them and eventually the shogunate itself suppressed and killed them all but one on April 1638. The daimyo was excuted which was to be the sole example during the era because the shogunate recognized that his evil deeds were the root of the rebellion. Nevertheless, the shogunate decided to take the opportunity to drive Christians out.;x

By the end of 16th century, this once-thriving kingdom on its trade with South-East Asia had declined because of losing ground to Chinese and European competitors. The shogunate attempted to exploit the opportunity to submit it. After negotiations broke down, the shogun permitted the daimyo of the Satsuma domain (the southernmost part of Kyushu) to conquer the kingdom. On March 1609, 3,000 troops with 100 ships of the Satsuma domain started to invade the country. Soon after, the king was forced to accept the domain as the suzerain.

EVENTNAME242056;Luzon Sukezaemon, a Red seal ship trader;x
EVENTHIST242056;Naya Sukezaemon (1565-?), known as Luzon Sukezaemon, was a Japanese merchant adventurer. He made a large profit from trade between Luzon and Japan in the late 16th century. In 1594, he made Toyotomi Hideyoshi a lot of tribute of imported goods to win his favorite. However, in 1598, he closed to be forfeited his property because of his rather luxurious lifestyle (some claims it was because of the outrage of Hideyoshi who knew that the gifted porcelains were valueless mass-production items made in Luzon). The quick-eyed trader fled to Manila to continue his dealing. Around 1607, with the beginning of Spanish interfere in the Philippines, he emigrated to Cambodia where he managed to win the king's favor.;x

EVENTHIST242057;Araki Soutarou (?-1636) was a Nagasaki-based merchant prince making a fortune in his lifetime. In 1592, He became one of the first eight merchant who were granted an official Red-sealed permit for foreign trade. He had travelled for trade to all over South-East Asia, especially Annam (today's northern Vietnam) and Siam. Nguyen Phuc-Nguyen the ruler of Annam favored the Japanese so much that he gave a daughter in marriage in 1619. Then she lived in Nagasaki until her death in 1645, even today she is still beloved by people of Nagasaki. Araki was also known by his unique shipping flag with the reversed VOC mark which aimed to beguile pirates.;x

EVENTNAME242058;Ikki and Kakure-Kirishitans;x
EVENTHIST242058;Kakure-Kirishitans are called 'Kakure (Hidden)' Christians because they went underground to avoid harsher persecution from the shogunate after the Shimabara Rebellion of 1637. Historically they barely managed to survive the shogunate era but they became negligible disassembled groups and many of them drifted away from Catholic teachings without good leaders. However, if the shogunate's religious policies had been insufficient because of a lack of the strong Confucian backbone, Japanese Christians would have been able to be united enough to act as seditionaries, combined with mass discontent with the regime in some cases.;x

EVENTNAME242061;HMS Phaeton attacked on Nagasaki harbor;x
EVENTHIST242061;As the Netherlands were conquered, all Dutch colonies began to provide their resources for France. Willem V the former stadholder asked Great Britain for asylum and taking over these lands. It gave Great Britain a fine reason to attack on any former VOC's territory. Even though the shogunate had known it by annual reports from Dutch merchants in Nagasaki, they had paid little attention because of the great distance. However, historically on 4 Oct 1808, HMS Phaeton sailing under a Dutch flag entered the harbor of Nagasaki. When fooled Dutch residents visited the ship, the crews captured them and threatened the authorities to burn down the harbor demanding fresh food and fuel. The shogunate decided to fight off them but it ended up revealing another problem: Local officials had reduced the garrison without asking mainly because of their default. Eventually, the shogunate reluctantly accepted their demands and the frigate left the harbor at ease. The incident caused not only punishments for those responsible, but also arguments on the diplomatic policy all over the country. The antiforeignism became dominant since there were repeated intrusions into coastal waters by foreign vessels even after the incident. Then the shogunate decided to adopt exclusive policies, which finally led to the reactionary Edict to Repel Foreign Vessels of 1825.;x

Eventually, the clan entrenched Osaka Castle, the headquarters of it, and called for potential anti-shogunate powers across the country to be engaged in the coming battle. The decisive siege battle was fought in 1614-15 with four months suspension, between the shogunate force with 155,000-194,000 men and the clan with 55,000-96,000 men. The shogunate managed to win it, called Siege of Osaka, and abolished the clan. With this victory, the shogunate truly accomplished the reunification of the country under its banner.;x

EVENTHIST242063;Though the region was relatively stabilized, the situation began to change since the end of the 16th century. Osaki clan monopolized an authoritative post called 'Oushu Tandai' or Shogun's Deputy in Tohoku since 1400, but local lords which got much stronger began to overwhelm the clan with the lost of central authority. Eventually in 1522, Date Tanemune, a prominent lord in the region, was appointed to 'Shugo' or Governor of Mutsu Province over Osaki's head. Then, the Oushu Tandai system was virtually abolished. Osaki clan was reduced to a local lord defending only his own territory.;x

In 1571, a vassal Oura Tamenobu suddenly rose in revolt against the family and broke away from them occupying a few Northern provinces. This treachery damaged the clan's solidarity and the stability in the region.;x

EVENTHIST242067;Date clan made a dramatic comeback from its hardship for a few decades, under Date Masamune (1567-1636), who was among the most capable lord in the period. From his first battle at age 14, he racked up victories so many as to overwhelm neighboring clans. In 1589, he managed to eliminate Ashina clan, which allied with the new central regime. The victory made him the master of southern Tohoku while it put him in a difficult position.;x

However, later he changed his mind and attempted to make his an illegitimate child, Shioichimaru the successor, then Vassals were split into two factions and conflicted each other. Finally Shioichimaru was assassinated with his parents in their asleep in 1550. Thus Yoshishige managed to inherit the family estate but the incident left serious after effects. The unstabilized situation continued for a few years.;x

EVENTNAME242069;Regional unification of northern Kyushu;x
EVENTHIST242069;In 1551, Ouch clan which also ruled a part of northern Kyushu regions was taken over by a traitorous vassal, Sue Harukata. Otomo Sorin seized the opportunity to turn his former enemies into his retainers. As a result, he ensured to rule the northeastern Kyushu including Hakata, a prosperous commercial city. Then, he gradually extended power over the surrounding area while he approached the shogunate to get vindication of it. In 1559, He was appointed to 'Kyushu Tandai' or Shogun's Deputy in Kyushu. Even if it was in name only, it legitimized his rule over almost all of northern Kyushu at that time.;x

EVENTNAME242070;Regional unification of southern Kyushu;x
EVENTHIST242070;Shimazu clan was an old-established family ruling southern Kyushu, but they are plagued by internal feuds for a long time.

EVENTNAME242071;Decisive battle over the hegemony of Kyushu;x
EVENTHIST242071;By the late 1570s, Kyushu was almost divided into two powerful clans: Northern Otomo and southern Shimazu. The tension between them ran high more and more, at last they fought a fatal battle, called the Battle of Mimikawa in 1578. Historically Shimazu managed to defeat Otomo and his 30,000-40,000 men then ensured the unification of the whole region. However, if the result had been contrary, what kind of situation would have become? Otomo Sorin, the clan's head, had been attracted to Catholicism since the 1550s so deeply that he was christened as Don Francisco just before the battle. He hoped to create the Kingdom of Heaven in the region...;x

By 1584, Shimazu forced Ryuzoji clan, which was the most powerful in northern Kyushu after Otomo's fall, into submission through the victory at the Battle of Okita-Nawate. Almost all Kyushu fell under Shimazu clan then it became among the most prominent one in Japan. Its army was renowned around the country for its aggressive tactics using mass firearms effectively. However, these facts ended up alerting the new central regime to them.;x

EVENTNAME242074;Great victory of Hojo clan in central Kanto;x
EVENTHIST242074;By the middle of 16th century, Hojo clan steadily extended power over central Kanto while other local lords wasted time on their disputes. Having just realized the fact, almost all lords in Kanto joined together against Hojo. In 1545, 70,000 allied troops besieged Kawagoe Castle which was a Hojo's strategic stronghold in central Kanto. In response, Hojo's generals worked out a surprise attack plan. On the night of 19 May 1546, 8,000 soldiers assaulted the besieging army. The attack was so unexpected that the allied force had to be collapsed once and for all. There were few casualties on Hojo side while 13,000 allied soldiers were killed in action. As a result, the alliance had to dissolve while Hojo ensured future hegemony in Kanto. \n Also, Uesugi Norimasa, the head of a defeated clan which was once prominent in the region, was forced to take refuge with Nagao clan which was a branch of him in Echigo. In 1561, he ceded his title of 'Kanto Kanrei' or Shogun's Deputy of Kanto and his family name to Nagao Kagetora, the clan's head. Later he became well known as Uesugi Kenshin.;x

EVENTNAME242076;Battle of Okehazama;x
EVENTHIST242076;This is the most famous, successful surprise attack in Japan, which was fought on 12 June 1560. Imagawa Yoshimoto, who based on Suruga (Today's eastern Shizuoka), focused on westward since he allied with northern Takeda and eastern Hojo clan in 1554. Also, he was the most powerful daimyo in the region while Oda clan was minor one which had just managed to pacify family infighting. Thus, no one doubted Imagawa's victory when he advanced on the west with 10,000-25,000 soldiers in 1560. However, on hearing about the enemy troops rested throughout a narrow valley near Okehazama, Oda Nobunaga decided to make a sortie with only 2,500 soldiers, rejecting common reactions like taking a strategy of exhaustion or making a humiliating peace. Arriving at the head of the valley, he ordered to assault just the heart of enemy's headquarters. This attack achieved stunning success: He succeeded to kill Imagawa Yoshimoto himself and miraculously won the battle! As a result, the situation completely reversed and Oda began to expand rapidly his influence. Another important effect was about Tokugawa Ieyasu, who based on Mikawa (today's eastern Aichi). He became independent from Imagawa, and then allied with Oda.;x

EVENTNAME242077;Nagashima Ikko-ikki;x
EVENTHIST242077;Japanese 'Ikki' meant not only just an uprising but also a league or bond among a certain social classes. During the Sengoku Period, farmers and local feudal lords often formed such Ikki to defend what they thought of as their rights. Sometimes they went so far as to expel their helpless lord and to achieve self-governance. Among these Ikki, 'Ikko-ikki' or Single-minded Leagues which gathered around Ikko sect, a popular militant Buddhist order centered on Hongan-ji temple much annoyed almost all daimyos because of its fearless fighting style and good organizational skills. \n \n In 1570, an Ikko-ikki rose a revolt against Oda in Ise-Nagashima (today's northern Mie). Cooperating with some clans which had been expelled from its domain by Oda, they made a strong stand against Oda's invasion and governed themselves until finally Oda managed to exterminate them without mercy in 1574.;x

EVENTNAME242078;Regional unification of southern Shikoku;x
EVENTHIST242078;Since the 15th century, eastern part of the island was under strong influence of central powerful clans like Hosokawa and Miyoshi, but another part of it was divided by many local feudal lords who defended his own territory. Among them there was Chosokabe clan which rooted in Tosa, today's Kochi. They managed to unite the area, and then, they sought to invade neighboring territories.;x

EVENTNAME242079;Regional unification of Shikoku;x
EVENTHIST242079;After the unification of southern Shikoku, Chosokabe clan quickened its pace to conquer the whole island, seizing the opportunity that Miyoshi clan quickly decayed in the 1570s. By 1585, Chosokabe virtually reached its goal. However, the regional unification was too late to advance to the next step as compared with the development of the central political situation.;x

EVENTNAME242080;Conflicts within Chugoku;x
EVENTHIST242080;In the early Sengoku Period, local feudal lords in Aki (today's Hiroshima) decided to band together to survive between two regional power, eastern Amago clan and western Ouchi. The lords recognized Mori clan, the most powerful among them, as the leader. In 1542, Mori Motonari reluctantly assisted Ouchi to attack on Amago. At first they succeeded to intrude into enemy's territory, but then, they suffered defeats in a row. Finally, They managed to return safely. However, Mori decided to push their coalition up to the position on par with neighbors to defend themselves from playing into the hands of other powers.;x

EVENTNAME242081;Regional unification of Chugoku;x
EVENTHIST242081;By the 1560s, once mighty Ouchi clan had been fully declined because of betrayals and defeats. Then, the Chugoku region had divided to two regional powers: Mori and Amago clan. When Amago Haruhisa, a capable family head of Amago, died in 1560, Mori decided to seize the opportunity to abolish them once and for all. Finally in 1566, Mori managed to capture enemy's stronghold in Iwami (today's Shimane) and force Amago into submission and united the whole Chugoku region. After that, Mori attempted to conquer northern Kyushu which once Ouchi had ruled over, but it ended up without good result.;x

EVENTHIST242082;When he had taken Kyoto, Oda Nobunaga promoted Ashikaga Yoshiaki as a puppet Shogun. Thereafter the shogunate had been free from being bullied as long as it didn't argue with Oda. However, Yoshiaki began to challenge Oda's authority because he felt frustration with his position. Finally in 1570, he openly called for anti-Oda faction to unite for his cause. Responding to his call, many lords including former allies of Oda organized the alliance against him. On the verge of a great victory, Oda found himself in a difficult situation.;x

In 1570, they began anti-Oda action all at once and plagued the Oda-dominated region with constant social unrests, responding to their hierarch's call. To eliminate this instability factor, Oda Nobunaga attempted to capture their main stronghold, Ishiyama-Hongan-ji, a fortified temple which located in Settsu (today's Osaka). Though the conflict evolved into a war of attrition which continued until 1580, finally Hongan-ji had to seek peace after Oda succeeded to cut their maritime supply lines. Soon after the humiliating peace, Ikko sect split into two factions and rapidly declined. It also brought about a drastic fall in the frequency of religious revolts across the country.;x

In the spring of 1590, he decided to eliminate the Hojo clan, which ruled over whole Kanto and was the final roadblock to unifying Japan, after the matter couldn't be resolved peacefully. Because of Toyotomi's overwhelming force, Hojo clan entrenched in Odawara Castle, the most impregnable fortress in Japan at that time. However, Toyotomi was able to prepare more than enough troops and supplies while Hojo failed to gain any reinforcement from outside, Hojo thereby had no choice but to surrender on 5 July 1590.\n \n Also, Toyotomi seized the opportunity to subject all daimyos in Tohoku including powerful Date clan. Prior to the battle, Toyotomi required support of them and to accept it essentially meant obedience. They could have ignored it under false pretenses or allied with Hojo to resist Toyotomi, but eventually they all decided to accept humiliating submission.

To promise a stable regime to his descendants, Ieyasu attempted to construct a more centralized system than the Muromachi Shogunate, in which local daimyos were kept exhausting with forcing public works, alternate-year residence in Edo and so on.;x

EVENTHIST3369;Ismaïl emerged at the age of 14 to take his father's position as head of the Kizilbash (a Shiite Turkmen tribe). He quickly established a base of power in north-western Persia, and in 1501 he took the city of Tabriz and proclaimed himself Shah of Iran. In a succession of swift conquests he crushed the Ak Koyunlu (White Sheep Turks) and resurrected the nation of Iran under his Safavid dynasty.;x

EVENTHIST266002;Upon the death of his father, Kara Yusuf, Iskandar assumed rulership of the Kara Koyunlu. In the Spring of 1437, with the hopes of fragmenting the Kara Koyunlu, Shah Rukh appointed Kara Yusuf's second son, Jahan Shah, sovereign of Azerbaijan. Rukh's plan was fruitful as the introduction of Jahan as a second claimant triggered a conflict of interests amongst the tribes.;x

EVENTNAME266003;Jahan Shah ousts Iskandar;x
EVENTHIST266003;Despite valiant attempts to resist, with the support of the Shah Rukh, eventually Jahan Shah gained the upperhand in the battle for control of the tribes. On April 21st of 1438, Iskandar died during Jahan Shah's siege of the castle he was hiding in and Ispan wisely retreated to Baghdad. Although by establishing himself as the only ruler of the Kara Koyunlu, Jahan Shah would bring stability, intially a few tribes still resisted his authority.;x

EVENTHIST266004;The death of Ispan signaled trouble for the Baghdad branch of the Kara Koyunlu. Ispan bequeathed the government to his nephew Elvend as his son Fluad was too young at the time. However, most of the emirs preferred Fulad believing that a younger ruler would be easier to manipulate. Because the interests of these errant emirs were in conflict with those of Jahan Shah, the main branch of the Kara Koyunlu found itself taking greater interest in the affairs of Baghdad.;x

His descendents would rule Azerbaijan and the Western half of Iran until 1374 when the Kara Koyunlu declared their independence and took Kurdistan and later Tabriz. These two nations would find themselves swept over by the might of Timurlane.

EVENTNAME266023;Safavid Takeover;x
EVENTHIST266023;Jahan Shah's religious policy was quite lax and subject to change. Jahan Shah typically espoused the religion that would help him the most at a given moment. Such a policy was dangerous as it was inevitable that his followers would tire of his duplicity. As fate would have it the Safavid sect, a sect of shiite priests from Azerbaijan, began gaining popular support in the 1480s. As was his policy, Jahan Shah sought to prevent them from ever becoming a threat by appearing to pander to their beliefs and invited their leader, Sultan Haidar, to his court. Jahan Shah miscalculated badly, as upon Haidar's arrival in Tabriz, the people of the city took up arms against Jahan Shah and proclaimed Haidar ruler of Persia. While it would be a while before Haidar could consolidate his empire, the time of Kara Koyunlu dominance was over.;x

After his success in irvan, Ismail moved to conquer the castle of Gulistan.

EVENTHIST204009;Despite having snatched the throne from his young nephew, killing many people in the process, he proved himself one of the most able rulers and administrators in Korean history. First, he strengthened the monarchy established by Taejong, by weakening the power of the prime minister and bringing staff directly under the King's control. He also strengthened the administrative system, which had also been introduced by Taejong, enabling the government to determine exact population numbers and to mobilize troops effectively. Just like Taejong, he was a hardliner with regards to foreign policy, attacking Jurchens on the northern front in 1460 and 1467. He also revised the land ordinance to improve the national economy.

This shrewd move failed when the ship bearing the diplomats was intercepted by the Dutch. Raja Sinha waited until the Dutch were over-extended and pre-occupied by the French attacks on their possessions in India and struck back with great effect in 1672. He was able to reconquer virtually all of the Dutch gains from the earlier phase of the war, although Dutch command of the sea enabled them to retain Trincomalee and the other ports on the eastern coast.

The Grand Duchy was to keep its old laws, a separate treasury and its own army under its own Grand Hetman and Field-Hetman.

However there was some Lithuanian opposition before 1st July... Mikolaj the Black, the head of the mighty Radziwill family had long dreamed to of detaching the Grand Duchy from the domination and recreate a Lithuania with him as King. The first steps were taken in the 1540's when Mikolaj approached the Habsburg Emperor who was very interested in seeing a weakened Poland on her borders. This lead to Mikolaj receiving the title Prince of the Holy Roman Empire in 1547. In the end Mikolaj never raised the Banner of Independence.

However in the last two decades of the 16th century a lot of protestant refugees from France, South Germany and Italy arrived. These cultural elite brought fresh idea to the Kingdom of Lithuania whom had been pressed between her catholic and orthodox neighbors. The Radziwilli Kings had strong royal power and had opened the country for influences from abroad. Cities were much more important than in the Aristocracy of Poland, and thus the people of the cities quickly became a cultural and religious melting-pot spreading Protestantism to the rural lands around them. When whole provinces slowly became protestant the King started to support the Protestant Faith. First personally and later as a State-religion looking at Prussia and Sweden as ideals. This also meant that Lithuania could take an independent stance between Russia and Poland. However, the many different religions in Lithuania made the government make a very tolerant religious policy at least until the 1640's.;x

However, the Lithuanian Magnates in opposition of the King viewed fellow Poland as the perfect societal form. When the King converted to the Lutheran form of Protestantism many of them became reformed. Both to mark their difference with the King and because the Reformed ideals of God before King. The Reformed faith was also a perfect ideology for them to imprint upon the serfs. They were serfs because God wanted them to be and thus they became more manageable.

Lithuania and Brandenburg should sign a Holy Protestant Alliance and wage war on Poland. Brandenburg would be freed from her Prussian vassalage by Poland and Lithuania would whatever she wanted and could take from Poland. A faction of young governmental official cherished it, but the King was a very careful man. He and his closest advisors discussed. There conclusion was very plain. First it was an impossibility to support Germans against Poland in a war of aggression. Secondly the worst possible thing was total victory. If Lithuania took a mile of Polish land it would be a mile too much. Any conquests would include more Catholics and orthodox and worse more unruly magnates brought up in the Polish Anarchy of a country. So the King politely declined the honor, but instead he proposed a tract of trade and cultural exchange. However as most political well informed Lithuanian could have guessed it did not come much out of it. The Society of Brandenburg-Prussia had far more in common with Poland than with Lithuania.

EVENTHIST3452;Before the Independence in 1569 Mikolaj the Black, named King as Mikolaj I, had become Prince of the Holy Roman Empire and befriended the Habsburg ruler of Austria, the Emperor Maximilian II. Maximilian was as sharp a politician as Mikolaj and profited on weakening Poland. Now Mikolaj's position was very bad in the 1570's he had to fight broad factions of Magnates in what could be described as a Civil War and fend his borders from Polish acts of revenge or even a re-conquest. He had to do what served independence best and that was to strike a deal with Maximilian. A Military Alliance was signed on 3rd February 1570 and Mikolaj's eldest son married Elizabeth of Steirmark. This alliance actually kept Poland from attacking even if local border incursions were regular. With the ascending of Rudolf to the Habsburg Monarchy the relations became wary and the alliance fell, but at that time the relations with Poland was at least acceptable.;x

If not they said, he not they would have to take the consequences. At this point Mikolaj II Krzysztof had newly been crowned. He was young and not as negative to noble power as his father had been. In an effort to keep societal peace he accepted a compromise.

The rights to hold office increased, but was now also made a duty and only the King could appoint. The Szlachta was given a say in the making of Foreign Policy, but only as a second house for non-Szlachta members was instituted in the Sejm which held legislative power of taxation.

EVENTHIST3459;During the 1630's and 1640's the Magnates found life in the Kingdom unbearable. To escape the egalitarian powers of the government and the King many of the started to interfere in local Polish business. Many of them owned as much lands on one as the other side of the border. They freely swapped lands with their Polish brother and thus managed to strengthen the Cause in both Poland and Lithuania. During the Deluge the Magnates of the Ukraine and the Wild lands fought all and everyone. Poland was in havoc and the Lithuanian King had to accept the fact that he only could control the Northern part of his lands. At these point King Aleksandras II mounted a huge campaign against the Tartars, Russians and Crimeans swapping up insurrective Magnates at the same time. He though stopped from interfering with the polish government, 'that last sane mind on that side of the border' as he called King Wladyslaw IV of Poland. The subjugated Magnates had two options. They either had to accept a tough reform package or get all there lands confiscated and pushed over the border to Poland. The choice was easy. They stay, but the reform was harsh. Only the state could now own land. The user only owned the right to use it. But to keep that right the user had to pay a user's fee decided by the King. With this vehicle the King started to break the large latifund holdings of the Magnates and again changing the fabric of society. His son continued the reform policy after the King was murdered by a Ukrainian Magnate on 30th March 1654.;x

It was a not too glorious retreat and he was considering himself defeated. The Szlachta had dethroned Aleksandras, but was compromised by the fact that the Polish King refused to have anything to do with the traitors. Not all the Szlachta was against Aleksandras and upon his return another army joined him. Together they smashed the rebel forces and executed the traitors.

EVENTHIST3465;In the Ebb of the Enlightenment Lithuanian government started to change slowly into a more pluralistic and modern society. Royal power was decreased to the fortune of the many and not the few. With the Revolutions in America and France both Poland and Lithuania started egalitarian reforms. Archconservative Russia which had conquered the Ukraine and the Wild lands did not appreciate these developments. She struck a deal with Austria and Prussia to split Poland and Lithuania and bring it under 'civilized' rule. The Revolutionary Wars of the East was triggered by the Murder of the Lithuanian King, Karol II Stanislovas, on 21st November 1790. The King had visited the theater in Vilnius and was shot by three cloaked men point blank when leaving his carriage to enter the Royal Palace. The King traveled lightly so his personal guards and servants all succumbed in the fighting and the murderers disappeared in the night. On 23rd the news hit the streets and thousands of angry people stormed the Russian Embassy lynching everyone in sight. The Russian Government immediately craved an official apology and to let Russian special police help the investigation. At the same time the Police Master of Vilnius, Rafal Kresmanikes, received a messenger from the Swedish Police Master in Dorpat, Gustav Adolf Reuterholm. Reuterholm disclosed a lead that Kresmanikes found leading to St: Petersburg. The young King, Ludwike Mykolas I, was furious. He allied with Poland and mobilized the army.

The Polish embassy, led by chancellor Jan Szafraniec and Zbigniew Olesnicki, the bishop of Krakow, protested harshly. Olesnicki gained an offical statement from Pope Martin V forbidding Vytautas to accept the crown from the hands of Sigismund, on the pretext that the latter hadn't been crowned as Emperor. It was a forceful blow for Sigismund, whose animosity for Poland grew even stronger. The final blow came from Jagiello, who had been threatened by the Poles that the treaty of succession of the crown of Poland signed in 1425 would be revoked if Vytautas was coronated.

EVENTNAME3632;Habsburg Inheritance of Lothringen;x
EVENTHIST3632;In 1733 there had been great conflict in Europe centered on the election of King Stanislaw Leszczynski. Russia and Austria had supported Friedrich Augustus II's son, but he lost the election. War had been close and several plans had been discussed to secure peace for all. One was that Friedrich Augustus II's son got the throne and Stanislaw would have been compensated with Lorraine. However that situation never materialized and when François III Stephan of Lorraine married Maria-Theresia of Austria the lands of Lorraine would be inherited by their eldest son, Josef.;x

EVENTHIST3735;On the death (1733) of Augustus II, Stanislaw returned to Poland from France and was again elected King. Under Russian pressure, a minority of the Polish diet chose instead Augustus III, precipitating the War of the Polish Succession. Stanislaw, besieged at Danzig, received only moral support from France, while his rival was backed by Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI and had full military aid from Russia. Stanislaw was obliged to flee from Danzig in 1734, and in 1735 he accepted the terms of the preliminary Treaty of Vienna. He kept the royal title but renounced his actual rights in favor of Augustus III. In exchange, he received Lorraine and Bar, with the provision that they were to pass directly to the French crown upon his death. The former duke of Lorraine (later Holy Roman Emperor Francis I) was compensated with the promise of Tuscany. Stanislaw' daughter, Maria Leszczynska, was married to Louis XV of France, but because of his many amorous escapades she appeals to the Pope to annul her marriage and he does. She immediately leaves France for Poland. When Stanislaw dies a couple of months later the petty noble of Lorraine declare the agreement of 1733 dissolved and they split the territory between them.

EVENTNAME217002;Johann Gutenberg;x
EVENTHIST331045;There was printing in Europe prior to Johann Gutenberg (c. 1394 - 1468) if what is meant is the making of images by applying pressure. Others had thought of carving an image in reverse on wood or metal, then pressing with color onto paper or what have you. Gutenberg's crucial invention was a new way of multiplying the multiple type for individual letters. He saw that a page of text was the task of printing frequently repeated individual letters, which led to the idea of making many copies of each letter to be reused as often as possible. Gutenberg's profession as a goldsmith and metal caster helped him solve the problems of casting letters that were interchangeable. In 1448, after some failed business dealings in Strasbourg having to do with his invention, Gutenberg found a wealthy investor in Mainz - his birthplace - in the person of Johann Fust, a wealthy lawyer. Fust invested two installments of 800 guilders in the project, but after five years had not received the expected return on his investment. In 1455 Fust sued for his principal plus compound interest and possession of all Gutenberg's assets. Gutenberg lost the suit, was ordered to pay 2,026 guilders and had over all his materials and equipment. Fust's son-in-law, Peter Schöffer, had beenGutenberg's foreman and so knew all the secrets of his invention and the product of his efforts, 'The Gutenberg Bible' - which was published sometime before 1456 - as well as the process itself became the property of the new firm of Fust and Schöffer. They promptly published a Latin Psalter (1467) and the Catholicon (1460). Even after his bankruptcy, another Mainz personage staked him a full set of printing equipment. Later, Count Adolph of Nassau, the Arch-Bishop of Mainz, rewarded Gutenberg, who was by then destitute and nearly blind, a modest pension. There are too many effects of the printed book to mention here. The key is a decrease in the cost of books. This made it much cheaper to build a nice library which meant that learning was from then on available to many more. It also facilitated the triumph of national languages over Latin, since many who were literate did not read Latin. It also spelled doom for many dialects - we know of more than 3,000 in Europe in Gutenberg's day - as mass production made choosing one language for a broad area a profitable choice. It marks the beginning of the democratization of ideas that continues to this day.;x

EVENTHIST17301;Vincenzo Gonzaga kills Chrichton, a Scotsman, who served as a counselor of his father's. His father, the duke Guglielmo is outraged.

However, two years later, Louis expansionism had convinced England and the Netherlands to enter an alliance against France and Spain. Duke Carlo III Ferdinando decided to side with the House of Bourbon. That unlucky political decision would mean the end of the independence for Mantua: since the end of Second War of Mantuan Succession the Habsburgs were always hostile to a French presence in Italy (specifically the Nevers branch of the House of Gonzaga) and wouldn't miss the opportunity to definitively subjugate the ducal city to the imperial rule.;x

In 1613 Monteverdi was appointed 'maestro di cappella' at St. Mark's, Venice. Monteverdi can be justly considered one of the most powerful figures in the history of music.;x

EVENTNAME220013;The Economic Crisis;x
EVENTHIST220013;The Spanish hegemony in the Italian peninsula was exercised by means of heavy bureaucracy and harsh taxation directly in the Habsburg dominions of Milan and Naples and indirectly in the rest of the peninsula by forcing the other minor Italian states to respect Spanish economic and diplomatic directives. The vassalage to Spain, which granted to some extent an enduring peace in Italy afer the Italian Wars, which the historians would call 'the pax hispanica', together with the disuse of the Mediterranean sea as international trade route towards the East Indies brought the Italian economic system to eventually collapse. As a result of this agriculture will become the prevailing economic activity in Italy until the end of XIXth century. That meant the coming back to power of the landowning aristocracy.;x

Ensuing talks failed with Guglielmo wanting to strip Montferrato of more privileges - resulting in open revolt led by Oliviero Capello with Savoyard and Papal blessing. An attempt on Gonzaga (23 Oct 1567) during a church service cost Capello his life while potential suspects were also persecuted. Flaminio Paleologo - Signore di San Giorgio e Caluso (natural son of Gian-Giorgio Paleologo) is the most famous of these.

Best known pieces were Mantegna's 'Lamentation over the dead Christ', Ruben's 'Council of the Gods' and Corregio's 'Venus, Cupid and Mercury'. Economic hardship in the XVII century induced Vincenzo II to negotiate the sale of his family's artistic inheritance to Charles I of England for 80,000 pounds sterling. Carried out by his successors to finance the War of Mantovan Succession (1627-31), it caused an uproar to a cash-strapped England but in hindsight was a lesser evil when Habsburg troops sacked Mantova (1629) and carried off the remnants of the collection.;x

Their cousin Ferrante II di Guastalla contested the decision. Mayenne's father, Duc de Nevers led a coalition of Pope Urban VIII, Doge Giovanni I Corner and Louis XIII. Guastalla's faction had Ferdinand II of Austria, Felipe IV of Spain and Carlo Emanuele I of Savoy. Mantua was sacked by Habsburg troops (1629) while Savoy trapped Nevers at Casale til Richelieu dug him out and negotiated the Truce of Susa (Apr 1630). Peace of Regensburg (Oct 1630) confirmed Mayenne's rights with minor concessions for Savoy and Guastalla but reduced the Habsburg presence in Italy and prevented French interference. Bourbon refusal prolonged the war til an outbreak of plague and arrival of Gustavus II Adolphus in Germany ended the conflict with the Treaty of Cherasco (1631).;x

EVENTHIST220033;After Imperial troops sacked Mantua (1629) and Savoy occupied Montferrato, French intervention ended Savoyard ambitions at Susa (Apr 1630). Although preliminary peace was achieved at Regensburg (Oct 1630), France continued to interfere. Fortunately a timely rebellion of French Huguenots under Enrico - Duca di Rohan (funded by Spanish gold) succeeded in drawing Richelieu's attentions from Italy, allowing Habsburg forces to retake Mantova and dictate the Treaty of Cherasco (1631). Nevers was expelled from Italy whilst the senior Gonzaga heiress Maria now wed Guastalla's heir - who became the new Duca di Mantova and vassal of the Imperatore. Montferrato was partitioned between Savoy and Spain, thereby securing the southern frontier shortly before the incursion of Gustavus II Adolphus in Germany.;x

Nevertheless Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I used his rights as imperial suzerain in the West to declare the succession illegitmate - making Anna-Isabella's cousin and brother-in-law Vincenzo Gonzaga (Conte di San Paolo) Duca.

Mattioli was imprisoned in France - becoming associated with the 'Man in the Iron Mask'. Regardless, Gonzaga and the Sun King stayed firm allies whereby Carlo became a French General - gaining a pension and a share in future French conquests in Italy (1681).

EVENTHIST222000;Like most of the Danish Kings before him Erik wanted to add Slesvig and Holstein to the list of their possessions, so in July 1413 he held a 'Danehof' which was to decide if Slesvig and Holstein was rightfully his. Since the 'Danehof' was a legal assembly used to solve territorial disputes within Denmark, and the counts of Holstein had waged war against the Danish crown in the past, the court ruled in favor of their monarch. The counts of Holstein rejected the ruling as they didn't view themselves as part of the Kingdom and the 'Danehof' had no right to pass judgement over them. King Erik was prepared for this response and used it to portray the counts as traitors. The following war ended in favor of the counts, but the Holy Roman Emperor (Eriks cousin) forced the counts accept a truce in which they were to leave all occupied territory.

In 774 Pope Adrianus I, threatened by a renewed Lombard claim to the Patrimomium Petri (also know as the Duchy of Rome), called Charlemagne in Italy to protect him, thus granting the Frankish King possession of the conquered Kingdom of Lombards and the Duchy of Spoleto as its vassal in exchange for the cession to the Pope of some Lombard held territories,the future Papal States.

The triumphant condottiero felt greatly aggrieved and most of all betrayed. After a harsh dispute with the Duke, he failed to obtain a personal interview with him.

Ludovico Sforza -the Moor- continued the fortification of Milan's castle, while embellishing it with the works of his Renaissance court artists, including Leonardo da Vinci, until the first fall of the Sforza dynasty when the the French occupied Milan in 1499.

Carmagnola's most important success was the battle of Maclodio (1427), but he did not follow it up. The Republic, impatient of his dilatoriness, raised his emoluments and promised him immense fiefs including the lordship of Milan, so as to increase his ardour, but in vain. At the same time Carmagnola was perpetually receiving messengers from Visconti, who offered him great rewards if he would abandon the Venetians.The general trifled with his past as with his present employers, believing in his foolish vanity that he held the fate of both in his hand.

The agreement and the investiture of the duchy will remain secret until Duke Gian Galeazzo's death, because based upon the formal reason that Galeazzo Maria, il Moro's brother and Gian Galeazzo's father, who died assassinated in 1476, was already born when Francesco Sforza still had to proclaim himself Duke of Milan.;x

Alfons of Aragon was defeated and captured by a Genovese fleet at the battle of Ponza in 1435. Transferred to Milan, Alfons succeeded in gaining Visconti's favour to his cause against the French Angevins. He convinced Filippo Maria that a French presence in Italy could be against the interests of Milan since the House of Orléans had never hidden its dynastic claims on the Duchy of Milan. But Genoa, a bitter rival of Aragon during centuries of dispute over Sardinia, Corsica, and the control of the Western Mediterranean trade, was appalled by Visconti's sudden change of sides, and immediately asked for admission in the Venetian-Florentine league against her former suzerain.;x

In order to enforce peace, Ludovico Sforza, regent of the duchy followed the traditional Milanese attitude to stipulate political marriages, which his father Francesco begun with the 1454 treaty of Lodi. A political marriage was arranged to strengthen the relations between the ducal court of Milan and the royal court of Naples between the Duke of Milan, Gian Galeazzo and Isabella d'Aragona, granddaughet of Ferrante, King of Naples. The ceremony took place in 1488 in Naples but the wedding was confirmed in Milan only the following year.;x

EVENTHIST228025;After the death of Lorenzo de' Medici, occurred on 8 April 1492, no Italian prince seemed to be able to keep on pursuing a constant balance of powers between the major Italian states. Florence, ruled by a foolish Piero de' Medici, was shifting his political attitude towards Naples at the expenses of Milan, so that Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan, quite paranoiac, abandoned the old league formed with strain by il Magnifico between Florence, Naples and Milan as to counterbalance Venice and Rome and signed on 22 April 1493 an Act of Confederation with the new Pope Alexander VI inviting Venice to join in. Ferrante I of Naples replied officially pressing Ludovico to resign from his regency of Milan since Gian Galeazzo Sforza, il Moro's nephew and Duke of Milan had already come of age and able to rule the duchy alone. Ferrante threatened to declare Ludovico usurper, and Ludovico decided to bring a bigger threat over Ferrante's head. Charles' ambitions to claim the Angevin throne of Naples were well known to Ludovico Sforza who, convinced to definitely solve his problems with the King of Naples, sent his ambassadors, the Count of Belgioioso and the Count of Caiazzo, to speak to the great lords of the Royal Council of France convincing them of the legality of Charles VIII's claim to the Kingdom of Naples, of the weakness of the Neapolitan armies, and of the glory the conquest of Naples would bring to France, once a crusade to liberate the Holy Land was in planning. At the same time, some Neapolitan exiles in France, amongst them Antonello Sanseverino, who escaped the baronal persecutions in Naples in 1487, assured that the Neapolitan people would have agreed on a French intervention. Most of the great lords of the Royal Council were against an attack on Naples, seeing it as very expensive and very dangerous and most of all senseless. But the young Charles VIII, who was carried away by a thirst for glory and a desire to conquer the Kingdom of Naples, paid very little attention to their arguments and heard instead the advice of his own advisors, many of them already corrupted by the money and promises of il Moro's emissaries with the lure of getting land and estates in the Kingdom of Naples and ecclesiastical positions from the Pope. Finally, after several days' debate, Charles VIII signed a secret agreement with il Moro's ambassadors, by which it was agreed that Charles VIII would send an army to invade the Kingdom of Naples and Milan would provide troops, money and free passage.;x

EVENTHIST228028;When in 1499 the French troops invaded Milan, Ludovico il Moro escaped to Innsbruck in Austria at the court of Maximilian I to ask his protection. Louis XII remained in Milan only a couple of months, then he made return to France and left Trivulzio there as his viceroy. But Trivulzio's way to administrate provoked deep Milanese resentments as much as to long for a Sforza's return and in January 1500, hearing that Sforza was assemblying troops to conquer Milan, an Anti-French revolt broke out in the city, the french troops were forced to abandon Milan except the garrison in Castello Sforzesco. In facts, with the gold he brought with, il Moro could hire mercenary troops and by February 1500 he made his entrance in Milan. After Milan, Sforza retook all the cities in the duchy and beyond Ticino River, where in Novara he had to face a French counterattack led by La Trémouille, also hiring Swiss mercenaries. The Swiss troops hired by il Moro, probably lured by the French gold and incited by their fellow-countrymen in the opposite camp refused to fight. 'The Duke's forces were composed of different races: German 'landsknechte', Burgundians who were commanded by the same Claude de Vauldray who had fought with the Good Knight in his first tournament, and Swiss mercenaries. There were bands of Swiss fighting on the side of the French, and those within the city declared that they would not fight against their fellow-countrymen in the other camp. They laid down their arms, and neither threat nor promise availed. Soon it was discovered that one of the gates of Novara had been opened by treachery, and that the French were entering the city. Then, as a last hope, Ludovico and his companions put on the dress of common soldiers and mixed with them in the ranks. But the unfortunate Duke was betrayed by one of the Swiss captains, who was put to death later by his own countrymen as a traitor.'(Bayard: The Good Knight Without Fear And Without Reproach, e-book by Christopher Hare) Ludovico Sforza was recognised and captured, then sent as prisoner to France where he miserably died, some years later, in the Castle of Loches, in Turenne.

EVENTHIST228030;On 28 June 1519 after the death of his grand-father, the Emperor Maximilian I of Habsburg, Charles, King of Spain and Duke of Burgundy, became Holy Roman Emperor thanks to the money of his bankers (Fuggers and Welsers mainly) in a very expensive struggle with François Ier King of France. Having proclaimed himself as the only legitimate heir of Charlemagne, the first Emperor of Frankish dynasty, François Ier had announced his candidature to the imperial election. As a matter of facts all the electors were heavily bribed in order to obtain the much desired vote, and that was standard practice at those times. Charles 'bought' the Imperial title paying the Great Electors and their emissaries the huge sum of 850,000 golden florins (equal to a value of Kg 2,100 of gold). That money came mainly from the Castilian rents as the New World still didn't provide with much income. Charles's election was also eased by the Army of the Svevian league, which impressed the doubtful electors when chasing the Duke of Wirtemberg, chief of the pro-French party, out of his duchy. That denied the last remote chance for François to win the election. Being elected Holy Roman Emperor as Charles V, Charles (Karl in the German world or Carlos in Spain) of the House of Habsburg obtained the rights of suzerainty over all the fiefs in the Holy Roman Empire. Amongst them the Duchy of Milan together with its sovereignty of the Republic of Genoa represented an important junction in the Habsburg's dominions, the socalled 'Spanish road'.;x

The Pope managed to have the Emperor grant Sforza the ducal title on the throne of Milan again, but under the firm condition that, on Sforza's death, the Duchy would have returned definitely to the Empire. A marriage was also agreed between Sforza and Charles V's niece Christine of Denmark. On 2 November 1535 Duke Francesco II died childless and, according to previous agreements made during the Congress of Bologna in 1530, the Duchy of Milan reverted to the Empire. As suzerain of those fiefs, Charles V had it administrated by means of life-governors whom he himself appointed. The Emperor's decision strongly displeased François Ier of France, whose younger son Charles, in possession of the title of Duke of Orléans and thus with dynastical claims to the Milanese throne, had his candidature rejected, in spite of his assurances of allegiance to the Empire.;x

Charles of Orléans and Louis of Savoy because of their family ties with the House of Visconti, Alfons of Aragon because of an alleged secret agreement with the last Visconti Duke which would have entitled him to the duchy of Milan. Encouraged by that and as to continued her war of conquest Venice tried to renew her old alliance with Florence. But Florence was now ruled by Cosimo de Medici, a Sforza's friend, who instead resolved to support the condottiero in order to check Venice and her expansionist policy in Terraferma. The traditionally good relations Florence held with France allowed Sforza to receive Charles VII's military support in his fight against their common enemy Alfons of Aragon who was ruling over Naples at the expenses of Angevin claims. Sforza's good relations with the French King, and consequently with the Houses of Orléans and Anjou, induced the duke of Savoy to make peace with the condottiero and to acknowledge him as the new master of Milan.

Beatrice helped her husband to become Duke of Milan and was present at the Congress of Vercelli between Charles VIII of France and the Italian Princes before dying during childbirth.

EVENTHIST228036;During the 14th century, the duchy of Milan was the most important producer of woollen and cotton fabrics in the Italian peninsula, and was competing with wool factories in Tuscany and other European regions: amongst them Provence, Catalonia, Flanders and England. Silk, already regarded as an oriental product, became more generally used during the 1440s when Filippo Maria Visconti brought in craftsmen from Lucca, Florence and Genoa, specialised in making high-quality velvets and gold and silver brocades. It did not take long for the new craft to become a leader in Milan especially for 'auroserici' fabrics (using metallised thread, spinning gold and silver together with silk) that became famous throughout Europe. The splendour of the Visconti and Sforza courts was a powerful incentive for the silk factories. In 1461 The Art of Silk was improved with the approval of the Statutes of Weavers and Merchants and in 1470 several decrees were issued to facilitate the mulberry growing in the duchy of Milan. In 1486 Ludovico il Moro ordered the construction of 'La Sforzesca', a farm near the city of Vigevano used for growing mulberries and silkworms.;x

But the main reasons for the concession were to be found in Maximilian's desperate need of money in order to keep the imperial lands under his control.;x

EVENTHIST228046;On 2 November 1535 Duke Francesco II died childless and, according to previous agreements made during the Congress of Bologna in 1530, the Duchy of Milan reverted to the Empire.

#;x
EVENTHIST228047;On 2 November 1535 duke Francesco II died childless. At those times, the only dynasty having valid claims to legitimately rule over the duchy of Milan was the French House of Orléans, which last member, Louis XII, also King of France, had previously bequeathed his Orléanais inheritance to the husband of his daughter Claude, François of the House of Valois-Angouleme, also known as François Ier King of France. The claims to the duchy of Milan dated back to Bianca Visconti, King Louis XII's grandmother and sister of Filippo Maria Visconti, the last duke of Milan of his dynasty. Because of this inheritance, François Ier and his sons could consider themselves as the only legitimate candidates to rule over the imperial duchy. Also Pope Paulus III of the Farnese family was aiming at the imperial administration over Milan and Parma to be assigned by the emperor to his illegitimate son Pier Luigi.;x

EVENTNAME228049;The Lombard hegemony;x
EVENTHIST228049;After having established the Signoria over Genoa, Filippo Maria Visconti restored the political control over Lombardy also recovering the Alpine territories of Domodossola and Bellinzona as consequence of the battle of Arbedo (1422) in which Carmagnola successfully led the Milanese troops against the Swiss pikemen. Not appeased by those political successes Visconti turned his greedy ambitions on central Italy, prosecuting interrupted family's ambitious policies to expand the duchy under River Po towards Romagna. In fact, his father Gian Galeazzo, obsessed by the dream of a reborn Lombard Kingdom, spent the whole life in trying to conquer all the Italian Imperial lands to be united under the same Milanese rule. Only death dissuaded him from accomplishing his proposed task. A newly presented favourable chance was the death of Giorgio degli Ordelaffi, Lord of Forlì in Romagna : Visconti gained the support of the local nobles in establishing his own Lordship as ward of Tebaldo, Giorgio's son. That of course displeased the neighbouring cities and above all Florence, with which Milan stipulated a peace treaty in 1420 as to guarantee 10 years of non-belligerence.;x

EVENTHIST228051;For more then ten years Northern Italy was the war theater of 'Mercenari' at disposal of the best offerer between Milan and the other Italian states united in a League originally formed by Venice and Florence. It was to the interest of all soldiers of fortune of both sides to make the operations last as long as possible, to avoid decisive operations and to liberate all prisoners quickly. Consequently the campaign were very exhausting and dragged on interminably, some battles were won and others lost, truces and peace treaties were made only to be broken, and no definite result was achieved. A peace treaty was also stipulated in Ferrara in 1428 in which at first Visconti stated to renounce claims to territories lying beyond the Panaro-Magra Rivers, but refused to concede the territories of Bergamo and Brescia to Venice, which was still occupying with her troops. Political and economic interests of both sides were conflicting and when the new Pope, Eugenius IV, was being suspected of involvement with the League to damage Milan, Visconti retaliated sending his troops to invade the Papal States. That represented a violation of the peace treaty and subsequently a new Antivisconti League was formed to wage war against Milan.;x

But war actually didn't and couldn't stop, Visconti soon invaded Papal States with the intention to punish the Pope Eugenius V, former Venetian Cardinal, for plotting with the League against him. Facing a new and stronger League, whose troops were commanded by Francesco Sforza, Filippo Maria succeeded in asking the condottiero to mediate with the League-confederates for an immediate peace. In exchange for that service, Sforza married Visconti's daughter Bianca Maria. Since Visconti hadn't yet any direct male heir, Sforza would be in condition to claim the throne at Visconti's death. In the treaty signed in Cremona in 1441 Venice obtained the suzerainty over the cities of Brescia, Bergamo and Ravenna while Visconti had to confirm the independence of Genoa and to give up definitely his ambitious plan of a reborn Lombard Kingdom in Northern Italy.;x

EVENTHIST228055;Since Galeazzo Maria openly ruled his duchy as a tyrant he made many enemies amongst the Milanese noble families. On 26th december 1476 he was assassinated in Saint Stephen's church during religious mass. hand Cicco Simonetta, Sforza's secretary of State, managed to have Galeazzo's son, Gian Galeazzo, being proclaimed Duke while his mother Bona of Savoy being acknowledged as regent until Duke's minority. That provoked resentment in the brothers of the assassinated duke, also aming at the regency title, but negotiations were successfully conducted by Simonetta. If in Milan calm was restored an uprise broke in Genoa against the Milanese Governor Pallavicini led by members of the Fieschi and Campofregoso families united togetheragainst the Sforza rule. Cicco Simonetta gained the favour of Prospero Adorno, once opposer to Galeazzo's rule thus releasing him from prison, with the promise to crush the revolt and reeastablish the Milanese rule over Genoa. Adorno occupied Genoa and became Governor for Milan. But Adorno started to have contacts with foreing rulers seemingly as to get independence from the duke of Milan and that represented a clear sign of rebellion. Battista Fregoso, member of the Campofregoso family, which gave several doges to the city, was asked to intervene in crushing the rebellion in order to restore the Sforza lordship over the Republic. Battista Fregoso managed to chase Adorno away and to proclaim himself Doge of the Republic.;x

The elder Isabella married Francesco II Gonzaga - Marquis of Mantova where under her auspices became one of the most cultured courts in Europe. A collector of antiquities, she was also a musician and poet as well as patron to the likes of Ariosto, Guilio Romano and Raphael. After her husband's death, she governed on her son's behalf earning him a ducal title and a Cardinalate for her younger son. Her sister Beatrice was consort of Ludovico 'il Moro' Sforza - patron of Bramante and da Vinci. Leading a brief but brilliant political career she helped her husband to become Duke of Milan and was present at the Congress of Vercelli between Charles VIII of France and the Italian Princes before dying in childbirth at the age of 22.;x

On refusal of joining Pope Julius II's 'Holy League' against France, d'Este was excommunicated and his lands forfeit to the Church. He fought alongside Louis XII defeating Papal and Venetian troops at the Battle of Ravenna (1512).

She evades Rinaldo and meets Ferrau. Rinaldo and Ferrau fight, then make a truce and share a horse to seek Angelica. Ferrau seeks his helmet and encounters the ghost of Angelica. She flees and falls asleep in a grove until awakened by a lamenting knight, Sacripante. Angelica manipulates Sacripante while he tries to seduce her. Angelica and the embarrassed Sacripante share her horse and encounter Bayardo. Noted for its many allegories and metaphors, it illustrated the fallacy of human sense and judgement over the ideals of knight errantry. Widely popular it became the basis of several Baroque operas by Antonio Vivaldi and George Frideric Handel.;x

Married by proxy in 1673, she became Queen of England upon her husband's ascension (1685). Although beautiful and charming the English detested her for being Catholic and an advocate of absolutism along French lines. When she gave birth to the future 'Old Pretender', a hearing was held to establish his legitimacy. Soon after Whig aristocrats deposed James II and Maria in favour of James's Protestant daughter Mary and her husband William (III) of Orange in the 'Glorious Revolution'.

Luckily he aquired the Duchy of Mirandola for Comacchio (1707) from the Spanish conflict, whilst gaining in compensation the Counties in Novellara and Bagnolo for the Polish struggle (1736). In between, Rinaldo married his son Francesco (III) to Charlotte-Aglae d'Orléans (1720) and his daughter Enrichetta to Antonio Farnese (1728) but neither alliance proved fruitful as Francesco and d'Orléans were soon enstranged and a childess Farnese passed his patrimony to the House of Bourbon.;x

EVENTHIST115000;In 1566, Khutukhtai, the great-nephew of Altan Khan, lord of the Tümets, became converted to Tibetan Buddhism and arranged a meeting between the latter and Seunam Gyamtso. The monk, who is thought of as Tsongkhapa's third reincarnation, persuaded the Mongolian lord to convert likewise in 1758.

EVENTNAME115014;The Great Tea Road;x
EVENTHIST115014;During the XVIIth century, Russian ambassador Starkoff brought back some tea to the tzar, thereby starting a profitable trade between Russia and China. Tea soon became the most popular beverage in Russia and was conveyed along the caravans trading road, which has become part of history under the name of « Great Tea Road ». When the town of Kiakhta was founded, it grew into the biggest wholesale trading center between Asia and Russia as well as a part of Eastern Europe. Tea was carried to Irkutsk, which became a junction for commercial roads between Europe and Asia, then across the Buriat territory and Baikal lake. The caravan would usually peregrinate for more than one year. From Irkutsk, tea was sent out to the markets in Tobolsk, Tiumen, Nijni Novgorod and many other towns, before eventually being dispatched throughout Russia. The Great Tea Road was 9 to 10 000 km long, and held the second place for its turnover, directly following the Silk Road.;x

EVENTNAME115015;Buriat Princes;x
EVENTHIST115015;The Buriats formerly lived in tribes whose members were in majority blood-related. A prince reigned at the head of each tribe and his power was handed down from generation to generation. The lands were at everyone's disposal, but the cattle was private property. A group of leading princes gradually stood out and got the upper hand over minor princes, who were already exploiting the poorest masses. This resulted, during the XVIIth century, in a Buriat evolution from the communal system to the feudal one.;x

EVENTHIST115017;A large part of the Mongolian tribes has remained unwilling to accept the sovereignty of the Yuan Dynasty who lived mainly to the West side of the Baikal lake and to the North of the Altai. Those Mongolians called 'Oirat' were strangers to the turmoil that shook Genghis Khan's heirs and which led to the expulsion of the last Yuan emperor in 1638, nevertheless they still represented a power to be reckoned with. Their leader, Esen Toghan Tayisi, began conquering scattered tribes in 1434, and then unified Mongolia under his power.;x

However, Mongolians did not take advantage of their position to rush and conquer China. Yu Qian, the Chinese War Minister, rejected any negociation to free the illustrious prisoner. Eventually released in 1450, the Emperor had a bad surprise : indeed his brother Zhu Qiy (Shizong) had in the meanwhile arranged his coronation.

Esen Tayisi was assassinated in 1455 and his heirs couldn't hold the tribes together. The Oirats got then divided between three groups : the Jüüngars (Left Hand), after whom Dzungary, an area to the North of the Xinjiang, will be named, the Khoshuuts, and the Torguuts, the latter being also known as Kalmuks.;x

Western Mongolians threw off the last remains of the Oirat yoke and joined Great Khubilai Khan's descendants. An exceptional woman, Mandukhai Khatun, took under her wing one of the few survivors of Gengis Khan's lineage, Batu-Möngke. She put him on the throne, expelled the Oirats from Mongolia, and took on the role of regent. When he reached the age of 18, Batu-Möngke married his adoptive mother and titled himself the Dayan Khan. His reign was incredibly long and allowed Mongolia to enjoy its first period of peace and prosperity since the fall of the last Yuan emperor.;x

The invasion of the Turks in early 1446 had desolated the land and given the Albanian herdsmen a wider range, forcing the Greek peasants to overcrowd the many Venetian towns. Albanians received favourable terms, for it was Ottoman policy to preserve them as a make-weight to the Greeks. In Morea 60000 peasants were reduced to slavery. It was thus that the Morea became perhaps the most miserable province in the Balkans, nor can there be any doubt but that Mohammad deliberately intended this to be its fate.

Giovanni Aseno-Zaccaria (natural son of Centurione II Zaccaria) self-proclaimed 'Prince of Achaea' rebelled shortly after the Greek withdrawl from Athene. Another was inspired by Albanian migrants who joined disgruntled Greek Arkhons under Manouel 'Ghin' Kantakouzenos (Governor of Mani) shortly after the fall of Constantinople (1453). Ghin Cantacusino was exiled when Co-Despots Demetrios and Thomas Palaiologos sought Turkish intervention from Umar Pasha - only to be harassed by Aseno-Zaccaria who'd recently escaped captivity at Klumutsi and raised another revolt.;x

He allied with Genoa and the Pope, and defeated Demetrios, who fled seeking help from the Ottomans in 1460. The Ottoman army duly attacked Morea and quickly breached the Hexamilion wall across the Isthmus of Corinth, which was too long to be effectively manned and defended by Thomas' forces. Thomas escaped with his family to Italy, where he had already been recognized as the legitimate heir to the Byzantine Empire at Rome. The commanders of the garrisons of the fortified cities in Morea, deserted by their rulers, chose individually whether to fight or surrender, depending on their own will and circumstances. In the final battle of the Roman Empire in its Byzantine incarnation, Graitzas Palaiologos, the military commander of the city of Salmenikos defeated Mehmed II, who after a month of siege returned home without conquering that 'unimportant city'. In the following year Graitzas received an offer to become a general of the Republic of Venice, which he accepted, thus leaving Salmenikos to the Ottomans.;x

EVENTHIST51013;The Wattasids were the ruling dynasty of Morocco from the middle of the 15th century to the middle of the 16th century. The Wattasids were an old vizier family of the Merenids and when they gained control of Morocco, it was in shambles. Morocco was in the midst of economic, demographic, domestic, and foreign problems. The inability of the Wattasid sovereigns, to deal with these issues, eventually led to the dynasty's demise.;x
ACTIONNAME51013A;The nation is spiraling out of our control!;x
#;x
EVENTHIST232009;Although the Wattasids managed to regain control of southern Morocco, the struggle to keep the south from declaring its independence once again, arose. The Wattasids decided to strengthen their line through marriage with the Sa'di dynasty. Eventually, the Wattasid idenity was effectively overshadowed by that of the Sa'di.;x

EVENTNAME232012;Al-Mansur's Heir;x
EVENTHIST232012;Under al-Mansur, Morocco become familiar with a prosperity it had not known centuries. Al-Mansur was a great leader and strategist. Prior to his conquest of the Sudan, he had already recognized his son Muhammad al-Shaikh al-Mamun his heir. His choice would prove to be interesting.;x

#;x
EVENTNAME232013;Muhammad al-Shaikh al-Mamun;x
EVENTHIST232013;The chosen of his father, his designation of heir served merely to inflate his ego. Quickly, al-Mamun became the center of many scandals as well as instigator of a few rebellions. Al-Mansur's patience for his son finally ran out and he had him imprisoned at Meknès. Al-Mansur had chosen a poor heir.;x
ACTIONNAME232013A;He is unworthy of the designation of heir and so his title is stripped!;x

Mulay Zidan procured Marrakesh were he would remain until his death. With this division, Morocco was no longer able to exert any control on the pasha government of Timbuktu.;x

EVENTNAME232026;Second Expedition to the Sudan;x
EVENTHIST232026;Al-Mansur's first expedition to the Sudan was a failure. He rushed to conceal his failure by fabricating the events that transpired. He stated that he authorized a guide to lead a rebellious group of troops in the direction of the Sudan and then abandon them in the middle of the desert. His folly was forgotten and in 1590, Spanish renegade Judar was given 3000 men to attack Sudan by way of the desert.;x

#;x
EVENTNAME232029;Dissidence in the Sudan;x
EVENTHIST232029;Newly conquered territory in the Sudan was difficult for Morocco to rule. So far removed from the capital, former lands of the Songhai were extremely difficult to govern. Many of these lands fell prey to attacks of the native peoples.;x

EVENTNAME232030;Rulership of the Sudan;x
EVENTHIST232030;Ruling such a vast empire proved to be more difficult than al-Mansur had assumed.

EVENTNAME232033;The Sudan Beckons;x
EVENTHIST232033;The battle of Ksar Kbir had saved Morocco from the aggressive imperialism of Europe, but the rest of Africa wasn't as lucky. Facing an expanding Ottoman empire to the east and European colonization to the west, Morocco turned south, instead. The Sultan struck an alliance with the central African state of Borno as part of his strategy to prevent Ottoman expansion. The Sultan also targeted Songhai, hiring an Arab named Ibn al-Filali to be his spy in Gao. In 1588, al-Filali reported good news - Songhai had been terribly weakened by a destructive civil war. The Sultan took advantage of the situation by sending a letter from a brother of the Songhai King asking for Moroccan help in reclaiming his throne from Ishaq II. The Sultan sent the letter to Ishaq II, asking him to accept Moroccan authority. Even if the Songhai emperor refused, it would give Morocco a reason for war.;x
ACTIONNAME232033A;Send the letter to Ishaq II;x

EVENTNAME232034;Songhai's Submission;x
EVENTHIST232034;The Askia of Songhai submitted to Moroccan hegemony, sending a tribute of gold and slaves - the first of many such. Morocco had become the most powerful state in the Sahara.;x

EVENTNAME232035;Songhai's Surrender;x
EVENTHIST232035;The defeated Songhai emperor offered tribute to Morocco in exchange for his Kingdom - 100,000 pieces of gold and 1,000 slaves. The commander of the expedition, Judar Pasha, was prepared to accept this and return home. His troops were exhausted, ill and many miles from home. In a rage, the Sultan rejected Askar Ishaq's offer and sent another general, Mansur Pasha, who he instructed to complete the conquest of Songhay.;x

EVENTHIST232036;After defeating the Songhai at the battle of Tondibi Judar Pasha occupied the trade cities of Songhai. He secured control over the salt trade but couldn't find the source of Songhai's gold even though he tortured many citizens. Instead he looted the cities, sending their vast wealth back to Marrakesh to fill the treasury and build palaces. He made his way north with thirty camels loaded with gold, slaves and fifteen of the King's daughters, which he sent to be the Sultan's concubines. The university of Timbuktu was destroyed and many of the ulema were decimated. Some were killed in struggles, while others were exiled to Morocco. The Moroccan army plundered the wealth of the city and burned the libraries. Huge libraries of books and manuscripts were dispersed. Timbuktu never again recovered its leading position.;x

EVENTHIST232039;The Moroccan occupation force had great trouble stabilizing its conquests. The ulemas of Timbuktu were not to be trusted, and Judar Pasha found himself out of favor with the Sultan for even suggesting peace. Judar was forced to govern with one hand tied behind his back when the Sultan sent a new Pasha to ensure a crushing victory against Songhai - a victory that never came, thanks to the miserable swamps of Dendi the Songhai forces hid in. The inevitable rivalry between the two Pashas contributed to a state of paralysis in the regime.;x

EVENTHIST232041;Taking advantage of the fights between different tribes in Tlemcen, the Spanish supported the Banu Rashid to dethrone Muhammad and install his brother Ahmad in the throne of Tlemcen in 1545. Muhammad sought the help of Hassan Pasha, ruler of Al-Djazaîr and son of Khayr ad-Din Barbarossa, and was restored with the help of the Turks. The growing Ottoman influence in the area reached Morocco, but the Sa'did Muhammad al-Shaykh, known as al-Mahdi, dethroned the pro-Turkish Wattasid sultan Ahmad. The days of the Wattasids were over in Morocco. He then sent his son Muhammad al-Harran with 30,000 men to take over Tlemcen. But the Turks defeated them and al-Harran died of illness. Then the Ottoman beylerbey of Al-Djazaîr (Algiers), Salah Ra'is, conquered Fez in 1554, installing Ali Abu Hassan supported by Janissaries, but Muhammad al-Shaykh reconquered Fez the same year and formed an alliance with Spain. The death of Salah Ra'is when fighting Spain, allowed Muhammad al-Shaykh to retake Tlemcen. However the Ottomans sent spies that assassinated the resisting Muhammad al-Shaykh in 1557, ending the bid of Morocco to take over Tlemcen, that was absorbed into the Ottoman Empire.;x

EVENTNAME230013;Humayun invades Gujarat;x
EVENTHIST230013;In the early 1530's, the aggressive Sultan of Gujarat, Bahadur Shah, invaded and annexed the states of Malwa and Mewat. Although he attempted to maintain cordial relations with the Mughals, Humayun could not overlook the ambitious sultan's military gains. In 1535, Humayun led his forces into Gujarat to teach Bahadur Shah a lesson.;x

EVENTNAME230014;Mahmud Shah asks for help;x
EVENTHIST230014;While Humayun was concerned with Gujarat, Sher Khan, formerly an impressive commander in the employ of Babur, took the opportunity to invade Bengal. By way of a circuitous route to the Bengali capital, Gaur, Sher Khan was able to catch the Shah completely unaware. The unprepared Shah was forced to buy off Sher Khan by ceding vast territories to him. Not content with his gains, Sher Khan invaded again in October 1537 with the aim of conquering all of Bengal. Only with news of a second invasion, did Humayun realize the gravity of the situation in the east. He marched against Sher Khan in December 1537 but was delayed by a long siege at Chunar and only entered Gaur in July 1538.;x

EVENTNAME230015;Humayun enters Gaur;x
EVENTHIST230015;Humayun's forces marched into Gaur without serious opposition in July and spent the autumn enjoying local festivities. In fact, Sher Shah was purposely avoiding open contests with the superior Mughal forces and left Bengal to occupy Mughal territories in Bihar and Jaunpur, plundering as far west as Kanauj. Humayun only belatedly realized the trap he was in and left Gaur for Agra before his retreat was cut off entirely. Sher Shah's Afghan followers lay in wait and Humayun's army was decimated.;x

EVENTNAME230016;Sher Khan's Victory;x
EVENTHIST230016;On the way home from Gaur in June 1539, Humayun's forces entered battle against Sher Khan and his Afghan followers. Sher Shah proved victorious and the Mughal forces were massacred, drowned or captured. Humayun himself was saved by a water-carrier who carried him across the Ganges, into which he had recklessly jumped. This stunning victory over the Great Mughal was a tremendous success for Sher Khan and made him the de facto ruler of the Mughal lands from Kanauj in the west to the hills of Assam and Cittagong in the south.;x

EVENTNAME230017;The Battle of Kanauj;x
EVENTHIST230017;The year after his disastrous defeat against Sher Shah, Humayun made another attempt to regain his empire and put down the rebellion. His brothers refused to cooperate with him in this, despite Humayun personally travelling to Lahore to convince them. Nevertheless, he quickly raised an army and faced the Afghans in battle on May 17, 1540 opposite Kanauj. Hopelessly demoralized and badly managed, Humayun's forces were soundly defeated and Humayun only just managed to escape. The great conquests of Babur had been lost and once more Hindustan returned to Afghan rule. Humayun was forced into exile for the next fifteen years.;x

EVENTHIST230021;After the conquest of Delhi, Babur was left with the task of deciding how to administer his realm. Rather than keeping the Afghani structure that had kept the Sultan weak during the Lodi period, Babur looked to economic structure of Persia and adopted the Mansabdari system. Under the system, the Mughal emperor generated land revenues by granting land to mansabdars who would pledge to provide the emperor with a set number of troops proportional to the quantity of land they were given. As the bequests were both revocable and non-hereditary, the system provided the emperor great control over the mansabdars. Of course, its onset, the reformed system angered landed nobles.;x

However, instead of handing over his spoils, Adham Khan set about ruling as if he was an independent ruler. Adham took grotesque liberties with the population of the province, raping many of the former ruler's harem and slaughtering the least attractive ones. Enraged by the audacity of his servant, Akbar rode out to Malwa to personally take control of the territory. When Adham barged into Akbar's harem and attempted to kill a noble appointed position equivalent to that of Prime Minister, Akbar ordered Adham to be thrown from the ramparts of the fort of Agra. Maham Anga went mentally insane with the death of her son, leaving Akbar, at 19, to take complete control of his Empire.;x

EVENTHIST40087;In 1450s, a lengthy bickering over the ownership of the lands being bought by Novgorodian boyars in (formally) Muscovy-controlled areas arose between Muscovy and Novgorod. On the other hand, Muscovites were still bitter over the heartily welcome given to Shemiaka by Novgorodians, as well as their refusal to pay 8,000 rubles tribute to Muscovy. Vasily II declared war on Novgorod in 1456, after the matter couldn't be resolved peacefully. Muscovy troops defeated Novgorodians and threatened to capture the city. The ensuing peace made Novgorod pay additional 8,500 rubles, return all the lands bought by Novgorodian boyars to Muscovy crown, pay yearly tribute to Muscovy Grand Prince, and agreed to write all laws in the name of Vasily II, and not veche, thus ending the independence of Novgorodian Republic.;x

Residing in Galich, a town in the north of the Muscovite realm, he claimed the throne for himself, mobilized a large army, and prepared for war. Vytautas of Lithuania, the Duke's grandfather, and the boyars of Moscow convinced Vasily to send the Metropolite of Moscow as an envoy who would negotiate peace with Yury. The latter agreed to a cease fire, according to which the Khan of the Golden Horde would decide who would become the Duke of Muscovy, while in the meantime, both opponents would keep their current posessions.;x

Yury however threatened to resort to arms, and finally, both Dukes went to the Khan's court. While Yury had formally more rights on the throne, since Dmitry Donskoi in his testament said that Yury shall follow Vasily I on the throne, and since it also was in accordance to the old Russian inheritance tradition, young Vasily was supported by the majority of the Muscovite and Tatar nobility, which was why the Khan finally decided in his favour.;x

There, however, Sofia Vitovtovna, the Grand Duke's mother, ordered to strip Kosoi of the jewelry he was wearing, as it was rumored to be stolen from Dmitry Donskoi many years ago.

EVENTNAME233009;Death of Yury Dmitrievich;x
EVENTHIST233009;Surprisingly soon after finally beating Vasily and securing the throne, duke Yury dies. His testament, written a long time ago, detached only his personal posessions amongst his sons, without appointing a heir for the grand duchy, but warning his sons to pay taxes to the 'grand duke'. This statement was taken as assumption that Vasily would again become Duke, and as Yury and his children had no real support amongst the nobles, Vasily easily regained his throne. Vasily Kosoi, Yury's eldest son, did not accept this, and started gathering troops. As not even his brothers, Dmitry Krasny and Dmitry Shemiaka, were ready to support Kosoi, his fight was doomed, and he ended up leading a band pillaging the Vyatka region.;x

EVENTHIST238001;Haydar 'Alî came from a family of calvary officers in the Mysore army. While serving in Mysore as a commandant, Haydar 'Alî had many occasions to learn about European methods of fighting and was deeply impressed. As early as 1755-56, he is said to have obtained the services of Frenchmen to organize his artillery, arsenal and workshop. Haydar 'Alî 's rise to power was the result of not only his personal dipolmatic skills, but largely on the armed power he acquired. His brilliant combination of European styled musket-using infantry and mobile calvary organized on the Mughal pattern proved invincible. Undoubtedly, he was the first important Indian commander to realize the value of European methods for drilling infantry, whom he tried to provide with flintlocks. Intervening in a struggle between the raja and his powerful minister, Haydar 'Alî styled himself the power behind the throne. After receiving the title of Haydar 'Alî Khan from the Mughal Viceroy of the Deccan, Haydar 'Alî found pretense to claime himself superior to the Raja of Mysore and took over control of the state. Shortly thereafter, he would go on to expand towards the Malabar coast.;x

EVENTNAME7118;The Naples Trastamara Dynasty;x
EVENTHIST7118;In 1458, in accordance with his father's will, Ferdinando succeeded Alfonso I on the throne of Naples. Ferdinando I, also called Don Ferrante, was the natural son of Alfonso V of Aragon and I of Sicily and Naples. In order to arrange a good future to his bastard son, King Alfonso had him married in 1444 to Isabella of Chiaramonte, a feudal heiress of remarkable feudal possessions in Southern Italy and granddaughter of Maria d'Enghien, Queen consort of Ladislao, the last Angevin King of Naples. But after Alfonso died Pope Calixtus III didn't legitimate Ferdinando as new King of Naples, he declared instead that the line of Aragon was extinct and that the Kingdom was to be considered a fief of the church. Although the Pope died before he could make good his claim and the new Pope Pius II on the contrary recognized Ferdinando, Jean d'Anjou, Duke of Lorraine and René's son, also known as 'Duke of Calabria', profiting by the discontent of the pro-Angevin Neapolitan barons, decided to attempt to regain the throne of his ancestors and invaded Naples. The war started well for the Anjou with the easy occupation of Apulia and the temporary control of Naples after the victorious battle of Sarno in 1460. Ferdinand was so severely defeated that his Kingdom seemed to be completely lost in Angevin hands, but with the military help of Francesco Sforza, Duke of Milan, through his brother Alessandro and of the Albanian leader Gjergj Kastrioti, known as 'Skanderbeg', who came to the aid of the prince whose father had aided him, he triumphed over his enemies in the battle of Troja in 1462. By 1464 Ferdinando could re-establish his authority in the Kingdom, Jean d'Anjou left Southern Italy while the barons agreed to recognize the Aragonese as their King.;x

EVENTNAME12022;Charles VIII presses claims on Naples;x
EVENTHIST12022;The French claim on the throne of Naples was unpopular with many of the Italian states, nevertheless, they were all cowed at first by the fierce conduct of war of the French army and by the powerful artillery Charles VIII had at disposal. However King Ferdinando I of Naples sought the diplomatic way, asking Charles VIII for the renewal of the treaties he had previously stipulated with Louis XI and to eventually submit the controversy to the Pope's high decision. As a clear answer to that his ambassadors were just ordered to leave France immediately. Then Ferdinando II managed to reconcile with Pope Alexander VI and that made Ludovico Sforza so suspicious as to request an immediate French intervention in the Kingdom of Naples. On 25 January 1494 Ferdinando II died and his son Alfonso succeeded to the throne. Alfonso's first successful diplomatic move was the alliance with Florence and Papal States. Fearing the French himself, Pope Alexander VI preferred to have Alfonso II as new King in Naples. But as soon as the French King, Charles VIII, moved towards Naples, part of the Kingdom defected from Naples and swore allegiance to the new liege. Also Alfonso II didn't want to face the aggression and abdicated in favour of his son Ferdinando (II) who arranged for resistance instead. While the French army did show its fierceness in Italy by slaughtering and pillaging the villages that didn't want to pay homage, no army seemed intentioned to face the invaders: instead of opposing the French, deals were made with them to avoid battle. Facing with a disbanding army and with a turmoil that broke out in the city of Naples, Ferdinando II was forced to leave his Kingdom and flee to Sicily under the protection of his cousin King Ferdinand of Aragon. On 22 february 1495 Charles VIII King of France entered the city of Naples distributing money to the populace. As a French diplomat, Philippe de Commynes, wrote in his Memoires, the French King took 4 months and 19 days only to reach Naples from Asti, an ambassador would take just a little less. Charles VIII didn't face any enemy army, so it was said he conquered Italy with 'wooden spurs' and 'chalk' used to assign lodgings to his troops. But the Italian diplomacy was already at work, looking for military support against the French aggression.;x

EVENTNAME239001;Neapolitan Decadence;x
EVENTHIST239001;In the late XVIIth century, the disuse of the Mediterranean sea as the main international trade junction between Europa and the East Indies brought the Italian economic system to collapse. Southern Italy became more removed from the mainstream of European development and the administration of Naples lagged behind that of their European contemporaries. The practice of agriculture as prevailing economic activity meant the coming back to power of the most conservative landowning aristocracy. while the receding of the naval threat from Muslim powers in the Mediterranean Naples also became much less militarized. That economic backwardness associated with the effects of Counterreform deeply affected Italian social life too, now less and less inclined to accept innovation and to develop some entrepreneurial attitude.;x

Important, scholars in the Neopolitan Enlightenment included Antonio Genovesi, Ferdinando Galiani and Gaetano Filangieri, who established the basis for, modern political, economical and monetarist sciences.

EVENTHIST239006;Giovanna of Anjou-Durazzo was not destined to be Queen, and when she found herself with the crown of Naples on her head after the death of her brother, she refused to give up her previous dissolute life. She soon started to yield the power to whoever happened to be her current paramour. The nobility was restless and conspirative. Pope Martinus V, as his predecessors, wanted to see Naples in the firm hands of a trusted man, but as a previous arranged marriage to Jean of Bourbon had failed, and Giovanna was now 50 years old, he decided to invest Louis III of Anjou, Count of Provence, of the junior branch of the House of Anjou, with claims to Naples. Martinus and Louis recruited the help of Neapolitan condottiero Muzio Attendolo, also known as 'lo Sforza'. When Sforza's army invaded Naples, Giovanna turned to Alfons V of Aragon, who had also distant claims to the crown of Naples, and in exchange for his help, adopted him as heir. Alfons arrived to Naples with his forces, and made Braccio da Montone, Sforza's greatest rival, commander of the Neapolitan armies.;x

Pope Eugenius IV declared that as suzerain he had the right to invest the new King and as for now he would send a bishop as temporary regent. However the Neapolitan people, determined to respect the will of their former Queen, ignored the Papal resolution and sent a delegation to Provence to urge René of Anjou to claim the throne in Naples. Since René of Anjou had been taken captive in Burgundy by Duke Philip the Fair, his wife Isabelle of Lorraine accepted the crown in his place. From his base in Sicily, Alfons of Aragon, who was designated heir by Giovanna between 1420 and 1423, and had a claim to Naples as King of Sicily, gained the support of the Neapolitan nobility hostile to the Anjou dynasty, and started making preparations to invade the Kingdom before the French Angevins could arrive in Naples and take the crown.;x

EVENTHIST239009;After his release from Milan, Alfons returned to Naples, where his brother Pedro had conquered Gaeta. Naples was defended by Isabelle of Lorraine with the support of Pope Eugenius IV. For three years Alfonso conducted as much a diplomatic war as a military one, gaining allies to his cause from the Neapolitan nobles. In 1438, René of Anjou paid a huge ransom to Burgundy for his release, and arrived in the Kingdom, but since he had exhausted his funds his allies abandoned him and he had to retreat to Naples. A long siege was then established, during which the Infante Don Pedro was killed by a chance shot to the great grief of his brother. The support of the Genoese fleet allowed René to sustain the besieged capital, but finally on June 1, 1442, 300 well-armed men entered the town through an open drain accesible during the dry season, revealed to Alfons' son Ferrante by some prisoners. After several hours of fighting, Naples was conquered and René escaped to Florence. After conquering the rest of the Kingdom, Alfons entered the capital in triumph on February 23, 1443. Pope Eugenius refused to invest Alfons as King of Naples and threatened to declare him in unlawful possession of Naples, Sicily, Corsica and Sardinia. Alfons threatened back with his support for an anti-Pope, Felix V, chosen at the Council of Basel, and Eugenius accepted to invest him in exchange for his support as the genuine Pope and help against the Turks that never materialized. Ferrante was named Prince of Calabria, and the Neapolitans were pleased that their Kingdom was not going to be incorporated to Aragon. Alfons, who as a Castilian had always felt a foreigner in Barcelona, never returned to Aragon, and his court in Naples was filled with the splendor of the Renaissance.

EVENTNAME239010;The Pope requests more troops;x
EVENTHIST239010;In the fight for the reacquisition of the Church territories, the Queen sent her best condottiero, Muzio Attendolo, 'lo Sforza', commander of Neapolitan troops to help the Pope against Braccio da Montone. Although both Muzio Attendolo Sforza and Braccio da Montone came from the Alberico da Barbiano's Compagnia di Ventura di San Giorgio, they had different approaches to strategic-tactical warfare, the 'Scuola Sforzesca' based mainly upon coordinated field manoeuvres and planned tactics and the 'Scuola Braccesca' based mainly upon energic assaults and the element of surprise. In their first battle against each other Fortebraccio (da Montone's nickname) prevailed. Informed of M. Attendolo Sforza's defeat, having always been hostile to the celebrated condottiero, Gianni Caracciolo, Giovanna's favourite advisor and lover, managed to induce the Queen to refuse the Pope's request of more troops in order to stop da Montone. In spite of her refusal and thanks to the mediation of Florence, Martinus V managed however to come to terms with da Montone promising him a title in exchange for his military services. Finally the Papal troops commanded by Braccio da Montone himself succeeded in retaking the Church territories. As soon as the order in his States was re-established and in order to punish Giovanna for her unexpected refusal to send troops, the Pope offered the crown of Naples to the junior House of the Angevins, always interested in the succession to the throne of Naples, proclaiming Louis III d'Anjou 'King of Naples' on 4 December 1419.;x

EVENTNAME239011;The Queen's choice;x
EVENTHIST239011;Alfons of Aragon, after being adopted by Giovanna of Anjou-Durazzo, arrived at the Kingdom of Naples with the intention of being recognised as its legitimate ruler, due mainly to his descent from the last Hohenstaufen King of Sicily, and not due to the will of a member of an usurping dynasty, the House of Anjou. He wanted to take control of Naples immediately without waiting for the Queen's death. He soon imprisoned Caracciolo, Giovanna's lover, but he failed to capture the Queen. Muzio Attendolo Sforza, the Neapolitan condottiero in the service of the Pope, informed that Giovanna was in great danger, went hastily to Naples and rescued her. It was then easy for the Pope to convince the Queen to adopt Louis III of Anjou, Count of Provence, instead of Alfons of Aragon. Taking advantage of the absence of Alfons due to his problems in Aragon, and with the military help of Visconti, Duke of Milan and Signore of Genoa, the Aragonese were expelled from Naples, and Giovanna appointed Louis as Duke of Calabria, the heir's title. Louis moved his court to Cosenza to arrange his stay in Italy.;x

Sanseverino managed to escape and took refuge in France at the royal court. The arrested nobles were horrendously tortured before being executed. In January 1487 during a wedding-feast arranged in Castel Nuovo (aka Maschio Angioino) in Naples, the King completed his fierce personal retaliations. He deceitfully invited the nobles who had taken part in the baronal revolts with the aim to have them all arrested, then after arguable trials all the nobles were sentenced to death. Rumours had that some of them were simply closed in bags and thrown in the sea, leaving no traces. As a last macabre act, Ferdinando ordered that corpses of the conspirators should be mummified and then permanently exposed in the Castel Nuovo as a warning to all the Neapolitan subjects. The break of the truce indeed displeased the Pope who didn't even receive the city of Aquila as previously agreed. Innocentius VIII will proclaim the vacancy of the throne of Naples.;x

Ludovico il Moro acted as regent of Milan in spite of his nephew's come of age and Beatrice d'Este, il Moro's wife, availed herself of her position as mistress of the ducal court surrounding herself with learned men, poets and artists and due to her education and political ability she took part in the ducal policies too. Isabella, member of a royal dynasty, couldn't accept to renounce the right to rule in Milan and nevertheless to play a second role at the ducal court. She then complained to her father Alfonso, Duke of Calabria, about her segregation in the ducal court and asked for an immediate political or military intervention in favour of her husband Gian Galeazzo, who dared not to retake his legitimate power. By this, Alfonso, Ferrante's son and future King of Naples, had the occasion for pressing his claims to the throne of Milan, which Filippo Maria, the last Duke of the Viscontis, seemingly promised to his grandfather, Alfonso I, before death caught him in 1447 and the war for succession in Milan started.;x

EVENTHIST239018;King Federico III of Naples was unable to oppose much resistance, and the French entered Naples in August 1501. Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba met more resistance in the siege of Taranto, defended by Federico's son Ferdinando. Ferdinando surrendered Taranto to Spain on March 1502, and Fernando of Aragon did not keep Cordoba's promise of personal freedom to him, asking Cordoba to send him to Spain. His father King Federico III had already ceded the Kingdom to Louis XII King of France, who in exchange for it, appointed him Duke of Anjou. Federico III will die in 1504 in France. In 1550 with the death of his son Ferdinando, who was taken captive in Spain, the line of the House of Trastamara Naples will be definitely extinct. But the Kings had neglected to properly divide the regions of the Kingdom, leaving the Principati, the Basilicata and the Capitanata between both parts unassigned. The French denied that Capitanata (a land on which both Apulia and Abruzzi depended for food and flock wintering) was part of Apulia arguing recent administrative usage, and refused to allow the commissaries of Spain to collect the tolls on migrating flocks as the treaty stipulated. Soon incidents were taking place and open war broke out in July 1502. But the lack of decision by the French to attack when they had the advantage, the skill of Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba and the delays of Louis in bringing reinforcements will see the French expelled from Naples in one year. Completely defeated in Naples by Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba, Louis XII of France agreed at Blois in October of 1505 to cede his rights over Naples to his relative Germaine de Foix on her marriage to Fernando of Aragon. After the battle of Cerignola on 28 April 1503 Gonzalo Fernández will be remembered as el Gran Capitán. He introduced many of the reforms that would change the way battles were fought for centuries, and lead to the creation of the Spanish Tercios, and also trained most of the next generation of Spanish commanders.;x

EVENTNAME239020;The Conspiracy of the Barons;x
EVENTHIST239020;Because of his distrustfulness of the barons, Ferdinando was pursuing a policy aimed at strengthening royal authority at the expense of them, that attitude brought him to have many enemies amongst the nobles of the Kingdom. In 1485, when his son, Alfonso Duke of Calabria, decided to revoke all the privileges that granted the city of Aquila a certain political autonomy towards the Kingdom, arresting the local nobles and occupying the city with his troops, the city magistrates refused to submit to him chasing the Neapolitan troops away and asking Pope Innocentius VIII for help and protection. The Pope, already put out by the fact that King Ferdinando didn't pay the 'chinea' (the annual tribute a Neapolitan fief has to give to the Pope as suzerain), accepted to help by sending troops to Aquila. In a rally immediately arranged in Melfi to discuss about Alfonso's aggression to Aquila, the nobles led by Antonello Petrucci, Count of Policastro and Francesco Coppola, Count of Sarno, King's ministers and by Antonello Sanseverino, Prince of Salerno, all hostile to the Aragonese rule, agreed to revolt against the King, who in the meanwhile refused to come to terms with them and confirm their feudal privileges. The revolt resulted in a civil war by which both Papal and Neapolitan territories were systematically devastated by the contending armies. On 11 august 1486 a permanent truce was eventually signed between Ferdinando, the Pope and the rebelling nobles, The King of Naples promised to pay the tribute due to the Church, to forgive the unfaithful barons and to assign Aquila under the Papal suzerainty.;x

EVENTNAME239027;The short and happy life of King Ferrandino;x
EVENTHIST239027;With the French entering Naples, the young King Ferdinando II, also called Ferrandino, had sailed to Sicily to receive the military support of his cousin, Ferdinand II King of Aragon. Starting from his base in Messina he then tried to reconquer his Kingdom with an Aragonese army led by general Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba. After an initial defeat against the French in the battle of Seminara, the King organized a fleet and, supported by the local population which was hostile to the presence of French troops, entered Naples retaking the castles which were still in French hands. But it was an epidemy which struck the French troops in Southern Italy that mostly contributed to Ferrandino's success: the syphilis. At those times Naples was both a great port and a very populated city and sailors who had sailed with Columbus a few years earlier had allegedly imported the new disease from the New World. However even if the French would call it 'le mal de Naples' and the Italians simply 'il mal franzese' it is certain that the French Army returning north helped this malady spread across Italy and eventually to all of Europe where it was known as 'the French disease'. Ferradino, now Ferdinando II King of Naples, didn't enjoy his realm for a long time as he died of malaria when he was only 23. Having died heirless, his uncle Federico, Alfonso II's brother, rose to the throne as Federico III. He was a weak monarch whose unhappy diplomatic moves to appease France, even acknowledging his realm as a French fief, and to encourage diplomatic relations with the Turk would let the Kingdom be prey of foreign powers. Ferdinand of Aragon, who didn't deny to disconfess Alfons V's testament to keep the crown of Naples separate from those of Aragon and Sicily, feared that the defense of Naples, crucial to the Aragonese trading in the Mediterranean, could no longer be entrusted to his relative. He had to face the difficult choice of either going to war against France or splitting the Kingdom of Naples with them. When Federico refused a marriage between his son Ferrandino, Duke of Calabria, and Ferdinand's niece, Juana de Aragón, Ferdinand of Aragon definitively resolved to come to terms with the French King signing the treaty of Granada.

When Napoléon was exiliated at Elba Island, Murat preferred to make a separate peace with the English-Austrian-Russian-Prussian alliance in the hope to preserve his crown. With the decline of Napoléon he also thought about uniting the Kingdoms of Naples and Italy (which owned the central northern part of the Italian peninsula) under his rule at the expenses of Napoléon's stepson, the viceroy of Italy Eugenio de Beauharnais, who still ruled in Milan.;x

In his proclamation of Rimini, the King of Naples meant to raise voluntary troops in the last attempt to defend his Kingdom and, in the same time, to expand in other Italian territories as to achieve a stronger position in a future peace treaty with the 7th Coalition. But his calls to the national pride of a population, which had never considered herself as one Italian population until then, remained unheard. After he failed to cross the Po River, King Gioacchino reorganized his troops in the Papal Marches and decided to wait for an Austrian army which was descending Italy to restore the Bourbons in Naples.

Conscious that Navarre, surrounded by powerful neighbors, could not longer win battles, he maintained good relationships with Castile, Aragon, France and England. Internally, he pacified the capital by granting the Privilege of Union in 1423. Up until then, the capital was not a city but three, the Bourgh of Navarraria, originated over the Roman Pompaelus, the Bourgh of Saint Cernin, populated by urban Franks, and the Bourgh of Saint Nicholas, populated by rural Franks, those two originated from pilgrimage through the road of Santiago. With the Privilege of the Union, all the differences were erased, and over 200 years of wars and confrontations ended.

EVENTHIST241021;Within Carlos III policies, Aragon was to have a special place. When his daughter Blanca, heir to the Kingdom, widowed from Martin the Young, heir to Aragon, she was remarried in 1419 to Juan, the second son of the new King of Aragon, the Castilian Fernando de Antequera. When Carlos III died, Blanca became the Queen. Juan, the consort, expent all his time fighting against his Castilian relative Juan II, and his constable Don Alvaro de Luna in defense of his Castilian possessions. Blanca and Juan had three children, Carlos, the older, received the heir title of Prince of Viana, Blanca was married to Prince Enrique of Castile creating a great scandal, as the marriage was never consumated, and she was returned intact a few years later, and Leonor, the younger, was married to Gaston IV, Count of Foix. In 1441, Queen Blanca I of Navarre died. According to the law of the Kingdom, the crown belonged to Carlos, but in her testament Blanca stipulated that Carlos should not take the crown without the consent of his father. It was clearly a courtesy to her husband. But Juan, necesitated of the Navarran resources to continue his fights against Luna, refused to relinquish the crown, although he left the government in the hands of Carlos. This decision caused a great upheaval in Navarre, whose nobility was already split in two powerful clans, the mountaneers shephardic Beaumont, and the riverside agricultural Gramont, ready to offer their support to the King or the Prince in exchange for increasing their power and weakening their rivals.;x

EVENTNAME241022;Finally the Civil War Explodes;x
EVENTHIST241022;As the Castilian nobles started to defect his side in his wars against Juan II of Castile and Alvaro de Luna, Juan I of Navarre needed more help. So he decided in 1444 to marry Juana Enriquez, the daughter of Fadrique Enriquez, Admiral of Castile, a title not related to the sea, but second in rank to the King, and also a bitter rival of Luna. But the strategy did not pay off. On the military front he suffered a crushing defeat at Olmedo in 1445, losing all his possessions in Castile, while his brother Enrique was killed. In Navarre his second marriage was badly received, and removed any remaining legitimacy to the crown that he could have. At the same time he completely allienated his son Carlos, who finally decided to take his crown from his father's head when he gained the support of the Castilians of Luna, and the Beaumonts, while obviously the Gramonts rushed in support of his father. The country suffered enormously from this confrontation, as incursions, crop burning and cattle slaughtering were the preferred methods of fighting. Finally, at the battle of Aybar in 1452, Carlos was decisively defeated and imprisonned for two years. In 1455 Juan stripped Carlos and Blanca of their rights to the crown, and named Leonor, his youngest daughter married to Gaston IV of Foix, governor and heir of Navarre on the condition of using his armies to conquer the Beaumont strongholds. After his release, Carlos travelled to Sicily, seeking the help of his uncle, the King of Aragon, Alfonso V. To show that the divisions continued, in 1457 the parliaments at Estella declared Leonor and Gaston heirs to the Kingdom, while the parliaments at Pamplona confirmed Carlos as rightful King.;x

EVENTHIST241023;With the death of Alfonso V of Aragon, his brother Juan I of Navarre becomes Juan II of Aragon. But Alfonso has left the Kingdom of Aragon in total disarray with his Italian adventures. The economical crisis of the County of Barcelona has the society split in two, the urban patrician nobility or Biga, the high nobility and the church in one side, and the artisans, merchants and burgheoises, or Busca, in the other side, with the peasants, or payeses of Remensa, opposed to their oppressing rural nobility. The nobility opposes the King, while the citizens and peasants try to extract from him rights and more power in exchange for their support. It is a poisoned gift for somebody like Juan, used to get what he wants by force. At the same time Carlos becomes the heir to Aragon, a situation that displeases Queen Juana, who already has a gifted son with Juan of name Fernando. The Beaumonts, supporters of Carlos, claim for a union with Aragon, the Gramonts defend the independence with Leonor and Gaston. Juan suspects Carlos might be joining the Castilians again, and inprisons him, and the civil war explodes again in both Navarre and Aragon. Juan is forced to release Carlos, but sick of tuberculosis, he dies in September 1461, leaving his sister Blanca as heir to his claim to the throne of Navarre. Juan has to fight the Castilians and Beaumonts, while he has the help of the Gramonts, Gaston of Foix and Louis XI of France. Blanca is an obstacle to the claim of Leonor and Gaston, but Juan will deliver her to Gaston who will inprison her in Moncada until her dead in 1464. When Enrique IV abandons his claim to the crown of Aragon offered by the rebel party in Barcelona, the Castilians leave the war, and the Beaumonts are defeated.

EVENTHIST241024;With Carlos and Blanca death, Navarre is running out of heirs. But the matter is not settled between the Beaumonts and Gramonts. The civil war is suicidal for Navarre, weakening her while her neighbors are sharpening their knifes. Louis XI, the spider King, has his eyes set in Navarre. His sister Madeleine of France is married to Gaston, son of Leonor and Gaston IV of Foix. Navarre is steering towards France once more after a century of Iberian influence. Once Louis has obtained the Rousillon from desperate Juan, he shifts his support to the rebels in Barcelona, that have offered the County to Renee of Anjou, Count of Provence. With the help of Louis, Leonor and Gaston, who have shown themselves as quite incompetent in ruling Navarre, decide to seize the chance and take the crown from old, blind, Juan, since it looks like he is going to live forever, or at least outlast them. The orphaned Beaumonts are more than happy to have someone to follow in hope of recovering their lost properties. Juan will once more disinherit one of his rebel children, naming Leonor's son, Gaston, heir to Navarre. But Gaston will die in a tournament in 1470, leaving two young children, Francois Febus and Catherine with his widow Madeleine de France. Juan has no choice but to reinstate Leonor as heir to Navarre. The war between Beaumont and Gramont however continued.;x

Fernando is able to convince his father that Castile can play a role in the pacification of Navarre. Instead of dropping the support of the Beaumonts, Fernando signs with Juan the Treaty of Tudela in 1476, establishing a defensive protectorate of Castile over Navarre. Castile will guarantee the safety of the Beaumonts and will defend Navarre from foreign agression. Isabel and Fernando are designing the union of Spain, and strongly prefer a dynastic union with Navarre. For the first time, Juan seems to trust one of his children. The Castilian protectorate will last thirty years, and although it will not end the war between the Beaumonts and Gramonts, it will greatly abate it. It will also serve as a Spanish counterweight against the French orientation of the House of Foix.;x

EVENTHIST241026;When Juan finally dies in January 1479 at age 82, her daughter Leonor is on her last leg. She is crowned but dies two weeks later. She leaves her Kingdom to his young grandson Francois Febus. He is 11 years old, but since 1472 he is also the Count of Foix. His mother Madeleine of France, sister of Louis XI, acts as the Regent. However the wars between Beaumonts and Gramonts reignite, and for two years Francois Febus cannot be crowned, finally he will be crowned in Pamplona in December 1481. However he died in January 1483. According to legend he was given a poisoned flute to play. 1483 was therefore a momentous year for Navarre. The crown had to go to Catherine, who was 15 years old, while her mother Madeleine of France acted as Regent. But his uncle Jean of Foix, Viscount of Narbonne, claimed the crown for himself. His brother Gaston was never King of Navarre, and therefore, as son of Leonor he had a better claim to the crown than Catherine according to Salic law. Jean, brother-in-law of Louis XII of France, had the support of the French Kings. Castile, as protector of Navarre, offered the hand of Juan, son of the Catholic Kings, to Catherine. This solution had the support of both Beaumonts and Gramonts. But Madeleine wanted a different solution, and against the decision of the Navarran parliaments, married her daughter to Jean III Albret in January 1484. Jean Albret was the owner of very extensive lands in the South of France. He was not only quite incompetent, but his French possessions were more important to him than his smaller Navarran Kingdom. The judicial and military war between Jean of Foix-Narbonne and Catherine and Jean of Albret will prevent the crowning of Catherine and Jean as Kings of Navarre until 1494. The dynastic fights between the Foix on top of the continuous civil war will cause the final demise of the small Kingdom.;x

The peace in Navarre will allow the crowning of the Kings in Pamplona, and three years later the defeat of Jean of Foix-Narbonne and the peace of Tarbes on September 7, 1497. Catherine and Jean were finally uncontested Kings of Navarre under Spanish protectorship. But the confrontation between Spain and France that was starting in Italy will leave no room for a neutral Navarre. Strategically, Navarre could be used as a backdoor to invade the neighboring country, allowing the armies crossing the Pyrenees unmolested.

EVENTNAME241028;The Final Crisis;x
EVENTHIST241028;At the time the confrontation between France and Spain, Navarre was ruled by incompetent hands. Since 1502 Louis XII of France was supporting the claim of his nephew Gaston of Foix, Duke of Nemours, son of Jean of Foix-Narbonne, and a French general, to the throne of Navarre. The Castilian protectorate had kept Louis from declaring war to Catherine and Jean Albret, but after the death of Isabel, Fernando married Germaine of Foix, Gaston's sister. Worried about this strenghthening of their rival claim, Catherine and Jean signed a treaty with Felipe I Habsburg, consort King of Castile in 1506, but they are betting on the wrong horse. Felipe dies, and Castile falls into a troubled regency by Cardinal Cisneros. A Beaumont sublevation in 1507 is defeated, and Navarre considers herself free of the Castilian protectorate and breaks the many treaties of dynastic union, the last one between Henry of Navarre and Isabel of Castile in 1504. The hands of Louis are now free, and he declares war to Jean Albret and Catherina in their French possessions, as he knows that an invansion of Navarre will provoke a Spanish reaction. However, at the league of Cambrai treaty in 1508, Maximilian of Austria, father of Felipe, and granfather of the heir, Carlos, will obtain from Louis the compromise of not attacking Navarre for one year. The days of Navarre are counted. She has been weakened by a still unresolved civil war, dynastic fights and is conducting a very poor diplomacy.

EVENTNAME241029;The End of Navarre;x
EVENTHIST241029;In 1512, the war over Milan had Louis XII of France excommunicated and at war against the Holy League formed by the Pope, Spain, Venice and England. At the battle of Ravenna, the Spanish troops of Fernando killed his brother-in-law and French general, Gaston of Foix, nephew of Louis. Fernando, married to his sister Germaine of Foix, suddenly inherited the claim that Louis had been using in his attempts at incorporating Navarre to France. The English and Spanish were preparing an invasion of France through the Pyrenees and Fernando requested guarantees for the neutrality of Navarre. In a final diplomatic blunder, Jean and Catherine refused and entered into a defensive alliance with France at the treaty of Blois of 1512. Fernando invaded Navarre with the support of the Beaumonts, defeating the French and the Gramonts. The English troops under command of Dorset, left disgusted of being used, leaving the Basque flank exposed, but the Basques defended San Sebastian from the French, and the Duke of Alba successfully held Pamplona. Finally the French had to withdraw with great loss. Fernando obtained a legitimation for keeping Navarre when the Pope excommunicated the Kings of Navarre for their alliance with the schismatic Louis. The Beaumonts and the population, that was tired of the civil war, swore allegiance to the new King in exchange for the recognition of their former privileges, and the Parliaments crowned him as King of Navarre in 1513. Fernando, then Regent of Castille in the name of his daughter Juana the Mad, decided to incorporate the Kingdom of Navarre to the Kingdom of Castile instead of to his own Kingdom of Aragon. Jean Albret would try to recover his Kingdom in 1516 after the death of Fernando, and the French would try to conquer Navarre in 1520, taking advantage of the Comuneros rebellion in Castile, but they failed to raise significant support and were defeated by the Spanish armies. The Basse-Navarre, north of the Pyrenees was abandoned in 1530 due to the difficulty of its defense, and was ceded to France by the heirs of Albret in 1620.;x

The siege of Pamplona was a complete failure, and with the arrival of the winter they suffered grave loses, retreating back to France in a difficult march across the Pyrenees.

EVENTHIST186000;In 1589 for the first time the idea emerged to defend large areas of Holland simultaneously instead of focussing the defences per city and fortress. This was achieved by inundation, flooding strips of land with about 1 feet of water. The water was to shallow to sail accros, but could neither be waded through because ditches and other depths were invisible. The whole system of ditches, sluices and canals allowed for a cheap defence needing relatively few soldiers to defend a large area succesfully. The inundation of land proved to be very usefull against the Spanish during the 80 years war and the waterlinie protected Holland from Louis XIV's invasion in 1672.

EVENTNAME186007;Baruch Spinoza;x
EVENTHIST186007;Baruch Spinza (1632-77) was born to Portuguese Jews who had emigrated to the Netherlands in order to escape the Inquisition. His early education was Talmudic, but he was excommunicated from the synagogue at Amsterdam for defending heretical ideas in 1656. At about that time he abandoned the Hebrew form of his name, Baruch, for its Latin equivalent, Benedict. Writing and studying in private, Spinoza supported himself through a series of grants, pensions and bequests. He was also a lens grinder of great skill, an occupation which he probably pursued out of scientific interest and which probably led to his death by consumption. Private circulation of his philosophical treatises soon garnered him a reputation throughout Europe and, in 1673, he was offered a post at Heidelberg. Spinoza, however, turned the job down, preferring to work alone. Spinoza's first serious work was The Principles of Descartes' Philosophy (1663). It presented Descartes' thoughts with suggestions for its improvement. In 1670, Spinoza published A Theologico-Political Treatise, (the only work he published in his lifetime) which criticized the House of Orange's militant Protestantism, defended religious toleration, and argued that the anthropomorphic conception of God was logically and theologically unsound. He proposed historical-critical methods for biblical interpretation. In the year of his death, 1677, his Ethics came out. It argued in an Euclidean fashion that the world was a monad - an ancient sophist position defended most famously by Zeno and derided most famously by Aristotle - and that that monad was God, thus paving the way for the transcendentalism of the Romantic period. His 'pantheism', however, was regarded as heresy in his day, which is probably why he only published once in his lifetime.;x

This is an optical instrument containing one or more lenses that produce an enlarged image of an object placed in the focal plane of the lens(es). There are, however, many other microscope designs.;x

EVENTNAME186050;The Grand Alliance;x
EVENTHIST186050;For years Europe has been preparing for the death of childless Carlos II of Spain. He was related to several royal families in Europe, but after the death of the designated heir, Joseph Ferdinand Wittelbach of Bavaria, at the age of six, the royal houses of Austria and France had a similar claim. But both were too powerful, and the addition of the Spanish empire would make any of them unstoppable, and so candidates not destined to their thrones, Philip of Anjou and Charles Habsburg, were discussed as heirs to Carlos, and several partition agreements were negotiated. That is precisely what everybody wanted to prevent in Spain. Despite the bigger influence from the Austracist party led by the mother of Carlos, there was an indisputable fact: France had 300,000 soldiers next to Spain and the Spanish Netherlands, and so represented the only opportunity, albeit small, to keep the empire together. A will was redacted and the agonizing Carlos signed it. It bequeathed the Kingdom to Philip Anjou, but it contained two crucial clauses, the condition that the crowns of France and Spain should never be held by the same person and that the Spanish possessions could not be divided. Austria, of course, rejected it, but the rest of Europe seemed to agree, as the equilibrium was not broken. But Louis misjudged the uneasiness that the rest of Europe displayed for the French expansionism, and made several mistakes after the Spanish succession. He closed the Spanish-American commerce to the English and the Dutch, and French troops occupied the fortresses in Spanish Netherlands. In February, the French States had ratified the right of Philip of Anjou to the crown of France, violating the will of Carlos II. The maritime powers had the motive and the excuse, and Austria discovered that now she had allies for the war of Spanish succession.;x

EVENTHIST186052;Verenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie (Dutch East India Company or VOC) was founded, with the goal of sharing the costs of the exploration of the East Indies and ultimately re-establishing the spice trade, a vital source of income to the new Republic of the Seven United Provinces. The first expeditions were successful in bypassing Portuguese dominion of the Cape of Good Hope and the Indian Ocean in general. The Dutch also managed to break the Portuguese monopoly of the spice trade.;x

EVENTHIST186053;As the Dutch fleets grew in size, so did their interference with Portuguese trade, and the first skirmishes took place. By 1619, the Dutch conquered Jayakarta which they rename Batavia and make it their EastIndies capital. For the next twenty years the two cities of Goa and Batavia would fight each other relentlessly, since they stood as the capital of the Portuguese India State (or the Indian Vice-Royalty) and the Dutch EastIndia Company's base of operations.;x

EVENTNAME186056;Dutch Golden Age;x
EVENTHIST186056;Dutch artists had quite different customers from their colleagues in other European countries, where church and nobility were major patrons. This had an influence on the themes they depicted and their pictorial style. Also many paintings were not produced for commission and found their way to auctions and art traders. This fostered specialization, by which less than brilliant painters could dedicate themselves to themes of their own choosing and still excel in a particular genre. The most famous Dutch artists from this age are Rembrandt van Rijn, Jan Steen, Johannes Vermeer and Pieter Breughel, but hundreds of others worked in the same period. \n \nDutch architecture was also taken to a new height in the Golden Age. Due to the thriving economy cities expanded greatly. New town halls, weighhouses and storehouses were built. Merchants that had gained a fortune ordered a new house built along one of the many new canals that were dug out in and around many cities (for defense and transport purposes), a house with an ornamented façade that befitted their new status. In the countryside, many new castles and stately homes were built. Alas, most of them have not survived. \nEarly in the 17th century late Gothic elements still prevailed, combined with Renaissance motives. After a few decades French classicism gained prominence: vertical elements were stressed, less ornamentation was used, natural stone was preferred above bricks. In the last decades of the century this trend towards sobriety intensified. From around 1670 the most prominent features of a housefront were its entrance, with pillars on each side and possibly a balcony above it, but no further decoration. \nStarting at 1595 Reformed churches were commissioned, many of which are still landmarks today. \nThe most famous Dutch architects of the 17th century were: Jacob van Campen, Pieter and Maurits Post, Pieter Vingbooms, Lieven de Key, Hendrick de Keyser.;x

EVENTHIST186067;Following the discovery of New Netherland, Fort Oranje was erected, near modern-day Albany, to protect Dutch trading with the Indians for furs. In 1621, the States General of the United Provinces granted the newly incorporated Westindische Compagnie (WIC) a 24 year trading monopoly in America and Africa.

EVENTHIST186069;The garbled news of the attempted coup against Raja Sinha II and his letter requesting assistance from the Dutch led Admiral Rijkloff Van Goens to believe that he was now helpless to resist any efforts to provide a buffer against any more raids from Kandy or expeditions to occupy the ports on the east coast. Raja Sinha proved Van Goens correct as he failed to mount any serious resistance to the Dutch occupation of the ports of Trincomalee, Kottiar and Batticaloa. However his expectations of increased revenue by doing so were disappointed by the general decrease in trade caused by Dutch monopolistic trade practices and discrimination against Muslim merchants. He was, however, quite successful in moving people from Kandy onto Dutch territory.;x

It therefore forbid the Japanese to buy any goods from anyone in Taiwan other than the company. Local officials even forbade the Japanese merchants to travel to China themselves to buy silk.

EVENTHIST186081;By 1655 Zheng Chenggong, known as Koxinga in the West from his title of Guoxingye (Lord of the Imperial Surname), which was pronounced ''Kok seng ia'' in southern Fujianese, had become predominant in the Ming court and he was determined to prevent the Western powers from interfering with Ming trade and to assert sovereignty over Taiwan's native inhabitants. He sent a letter to the VOC's Governor of Taiwan in August 1655. The Spanish, wrote Chenggong, had been mistreating his sailors, and he had therefore issued an edict that forbade Chinese to sail to Manila on pain of death. He enclosed a copy of the edict and requested that the Governor propagate it in Formosa and enforce it by confiscating the junks and property of any who disobeyed. But the language of the edict raised the hackles of the VOC. First, it said that the Dutch ''behave more like animals than Christians.'' Second, it referred to Chinese who lived in the Dutch colony as Chenggong's subjects. Third, and most important, it threatened punishment not only for Chinese but also for ''anyone outside of our nation who extends money for trade with Manila.'' If company officials did as Chenggong asked and published the edict, they would be admitting that Chenggong had sovereignty over the Chinese colonists in Formosa. The Governor and the council decided they must refuse Chenggong's request to preserve ''the sovereignty of the Netherlanders.'' They replied with a ''compliment letter,'' which politely declined his request. The VOC also sent a small fleet to the coast of China, but they found no sign of preparations for invasion. However, Zheng seems to have intimidated many of the Chinese merchants who normally came to trade in Taiwan because very few would brave his displeasure over the next few years.;x

It's still unknown why the orange stripe was changed to red, but there are two main theories:\n 1. a new method of producing orange paint resulted in a darker shade, almost red.\n 2. the House of Orange became less popular.\n \n The colours were however never laid down officially until 1937.;x

EVENTHIST3582;Historically, in the 16th century the Roman Empire of Constantinople was long gone and its revival viewed as impossible. The Orthodox Faith never had a head figure like the Pope of the Catholic Faith. It however was mostly guided from Constantinople by the Patriarch there. As the Sunni Muslim Ottomans used the Patriarchs hostage-like situation for there own political gains many Orthodox countries felt appalled and started to loosen the chains of tradition. There had not existed a country as mighty as the Byzantines until...Russia was formed. Russia was created from the notion of full control of all those orthodox people that once had been Christianized from Kiev. This together with the fact that there was only one Orthodox country powerful enough to take up the mantle of the fallen Byzantines made the solution perfect and, thus the Greatest of Princedoms changed into the Empire of Russia.;x

In 1426 he invaded the republic and forced it to pay tribute. In 1427 he made the borderland between Lithuania and Muscovy, known as the Wierchovian princedoms, subordinate to himself. It was composed of many small regions, which maintained their independence by maintaining tensions between Lithuania and Muscovy. After subduing Pskov, Vytautas turned his attention to Novgorod.

EVENTNAME289000;The fall of Alodia;x
EVENTHIST289000;Medieval Nubia was divided onto two Kingdoms. The northern, known as Makkura or Makuria with its capital at Dongola reached its zenith at the end of the first millennium. It was eventually destroyed and conquered by the growing Mamluk state in 14th century, though some small Christian pockets like the Kingdom of Dotawo survived well into 15th century. In contrast to well known Makuria, the history of southern Nubian Kingdom of Alodia or Alwa, with capital at Soba, is almost completely unknown. The only thing that we can be sure is that it preserved its political and cultural independence for much longer. Modern historians speculate that Alodia or its successor states finally met their end in 1504 when a confederation of Muslim tribes called Funj conquered central Nubia and established sultanate of Sennar there. The fate of local Christians is obscure, but they most probably suffered severe persecutions. Ethiopian chronicles mention envoys sent by Nubian Christians with desperate calls for help. Nevertheless, Nubia became almost entirely Muslim country before the end of 17th century.;x

Much of the local petty dynasties were descendants of such Mamluks. Others settled along Blue Nile and created an unique society of nomadic warriors quite similar to Ukrainian and Russian Cossacks.

In 1521, when he had worked for a couple of months he was so enamored with the Knights and their ideals that he kneeled in front of the Grand Master and begged him to make him a Knight.

EVENTNAME24004;Tripoli gamble;x
EVENTHIST24004;After the capture of Tripoli, Carlos V left the Knights of St. John in charge of the defenses of this North African city. The Grandmaster Juan de Omedes was not particularly happy about this new burden, as it proved to be a drain on the Knights' budget and was very hard to defend. Despite this, Tripoli held its own advantages. Mainly it had richer soils than the rocks of Malta and more fresh water, which would have cut the Knights' dependence on Carlos's governors in Sicily. For a while, the idea of moving to Tripoli was seriously entertained by the Order, but bureaucratic delays and the eventual loss of Tripoli buried the idea before it could become a reality.;x

EVENTNAME24009;Knights of Rhodes;x
EVENTHIST24009;In a sense, the Knights of Rhodes were a medieval form of a multicultural international corporation in that their members were drawn from numerous Christian Kingdoms and Principalities. They were divided into eight Langues, or Tongues, consisting of the eight European nationalities from whom its members were primarily recruited. These Langues were Auvergne, Provence, France, Aragon, Castile and Portugal, England, Germany, and Italy. In a fortress occupied by the Knights, each Langue was responsible for defending a particular section of the walls. These divisions might be thought to promote disunity, but on the other hand, they also fostered a kind of rivalry that could ultimately lift morale and prove of benefit, especially during seige conditions. Furthermore, the Knights owned estates and enjoyed the revenues of thousands of manors across these same European areas.;x

EVENTNAME24010;The Crusade that Never Was;x
EVENTHIST24010;In September of 1459, Pope Pius II summoned a congress of the Christian powers at Mantua to organize a crusade, but the lack of enthusiasm among the delegates was notable. However, in 1462, it was announced that the Pope and the Duke of Burgundy, Philip the Good, would lead the crusade and that Venice would provide a fleet. The Duke of Burgundy insisted on further delay, perhaps due to trouble at home or recognition that the Papal forces were in disarray and not likely to prove an effective ally for a desperate expedition. In any event, Pius II set out for Ancona with the Papal troops to meet the Venetian Doge, Cristoforo Moro. No other significant forces had shown themselves so it was inevitable that following the death of Pius II, the would-be crusaders dispersed.;x

EVENTHIST24014;The Islamic corsair known as Jamali had used artillery to breach the walls of a castle held by the Knights on an outlying island. The castle was thought to be staffed with only two Knights: an elderly bedridden commander and a young brother, Paolo Simeoni. However, upon approaching the breach, the corsairs were amazed to see before them a large contingent of brethern waiting in the breach. They hastily set sail, not realizing that Fra' Paolo had simply dressed the island's entire population, man, woman, and child, in the surcoats of the Order.;x

EVENTNAME24015;Capture of the Morgarbina;x
EVENTHIST24015;The Morgarbina was a gigantic vessel with seven decks which plied the seas between Tunis and Constantinople. Wealthy merchants confidently used her to ship their richest wares, confident that not even the notorious Knights could capture her. Commander de Gastineau, a wily captain from Limousin, waylaid the leviathan off Crete. Under pretence of parleying, he laid the Order's own great carrack alongside and then mowed down the captain and officers on the poop with one murderous salvo of grapeshot. The leaderless crew struck their colours and the Knights boarded to find a staggering consignment of silver and jewellery as well as bales of silk, cashmere and carpets, and quantities of pepper, ginger, cloves, and cinnamon. On the way home, the brethern captured three smaller cargo ships, and the entire treasure was eventually sold in France, its owners being held to ransom or sent to the slave market.;x

The third candidate was chosen to the noisy dismay of d'Amaral, who shouted, 'This will be the last Grand Master of Rhodes!'

EVENTHIST24020;A new hospital, the Sacra Infermeria, opens. This facility is thought to be one of the finest in the western world, in part due to an unprecedented emphasis on hygiene. The Knights may have also been inadvertently influenced by the philosophies of Eastern medicine. The infirmary sheltered an average of 350 patients, and the staff included Doctors, surgeons, nurses, and pharmacists. The food was specially chosen (vermicelli and chicken for the weak, wine and game for the stong) and served on silver dishes. There were clinics for outpatients, one for leprosy and another for venereal disease, slaves and beggars receiving free prescriptions. An external nursing service tended the old in their own homes. During his novitiate, each Knight had to serve in the Hospital for one day a week, as did the Grand Master and the bailiffs on great feast-days.;x

The library consisted of Balì Guerin de Tencin's own books and of other ones he bought or found out in the sacristy of Conventual Church of Saint John. At first the library numbered over 19,000 books, number augmented by books bequeathed by members of the Order. It is said that Balì Guerin de Tencin utilised the wood of the cases used in transporting the 9,700 books he bought from Cardinal Portocarrero in Rome for the shelves of his library.;x

EVENTNAME24028;A New Protector;x
EVENTHIST24028;In the 18th century Malta became a place of interest to the ever-expanding empires: Austria, England, France, and even Russia. Ecaterina II considered the island a great asset in her plans for expansion in the Balkans, and indeed, in 1768 a Russian squadron suddenly arrived off Malta, trying to enlist the Order's military help in their expedition against the Ottomans. Simultaneously, the empress' agents attempted to rouse the Maltese population against the Knights, and only with the help of the French royal court did the Order evade the threat. However, the French Revolution caused the Knights great financial problems, as over half of their lands were confiscated. When with the third partition of Poland the Russian czar took control of the Order's estates in Courland and Volyn, he decided to follow his mother's strategy, and declared himself the Protector of the Order of St. John. Distressed by the Revolution and the Knights' internal problems, Grand Master Emmanuel de Rohan accepted the offer in 1797.;x

Their rulership of Tripoli put them right in the middle of the Ottoman Turks quest for supremacy in North Africa.

EVENTHIST24057;In 1797, Napoléon Bonaparte arrived on Malta with an expeditionary force to claim the island as a base for his Egyptian campaign. Many brethren were too old to fight, and some French and Spanish knights were unwilling to take part in its defense. Others, French knights embittered by the Revolution, were ready to man the walls. Early reverses in small engagements demoralized the Maltese, who began to desert. The Grandmaster, Ferdinand von Hompesch, faced with the prospect of mutiny, lost his nerve and asked for an armistice. On the night of June 17, 1798 the Grandmaster left his palace and the island taking with him all but a few religious artifacts. The French did not get a chance to settle down on Malta, as their reckless pillaging resulted in a full-scale uprising in a matter of months. The Maltese, supported by English and Portuguese forces, retook the island, and on June 15, 1802, a group of Maltese nobles led by Marquis Testaferrata offered the island to the British crown.;x

EVENTNAME249001;Bhanudeva's Expedition against the Reddy;x
EVENTHIST249001;The Reddy people ruled over two independent Hindu states to the south of Orissa, Kondavidu and Rajahmundry. Although they were small, the Kingdoms were rich and maintained large armies. In 1391 and 1398 the Reddy defeated King Narasimhadeva IV, but in spite of this Orissa maintained control of its southern provinces. Around the turn of the century the Reddy Kingdom was wracked by civil war and Narasimhadeva took advantage of it to reorganize the south against future invasions. His son Bhanudeva IV decided to end the Reddy threat once and for all and led an expedition to the far south in 1434.;x

EVENTNAME249002;Downfall of the Gangas;x
EVENTHIST249002;With Bhanudeva IV preoccupied with the Reddy in the south a young man named Kapilendra Routray took the opportunity to seize power. Kapilendra was the grandson of a nayaka, or feudal governor and tribal chief. He murdered the King and returned to the north with an army. The first years of his reign were spent fighting the forces of the Gangas and turning back an invasion by the Sultan of Bengal. To gain support for his shaky rule, Kapilendra abolished the unpopular salt tax and made generous donations to the priests of Jagannath, who in return announced that the god had personally chosen Kapilendra to be King. This gave Kapilendra much-needed legitimacy in the south and he began to persecute his enemies.;x

Thanks to a timely invasion by the Sultan of Bengal, Kamarnadeva was able to retake the capital and the Surya forces disintegrated. After this crisis the new ruler recognized the danger posed by the tribal chiefs who had rebelled and began taking steps to restrict their power.

A weak ruler, Bhanudeva IV was overthrown by a tribal chieftain, Kapilendra, who defeated the vestiges of Ganga power and established the Suryavamsha (Sun) dynasty in its place, declaring himself the 'Servitor of Jagannath'.;x

EVENTNAME249005;The Temple of Jagannath;x
EVENTHIST249005;As they expanded down the coast, earlier Ganga monarchs had built a temple to Jagannath, a tribal deity, to build ties with their new subjects, but worship of their own god Purusottama remained dominant. Under the Surya dynasty this balance of power shifted in favor of the tribal deity Jagannath, whose temple at Puri was expanded greatly by the King. Surya monarchs used the Bhakti cult as a way of maintaining control over their Hindu subjects and even occasionally against other Hindu monarchs. The temple became a great site of pilgrimage, especially after the Maratha conquest, when it attracted pilgrims from across India.;x

With the help of his son Hamvira, Oriya forces occupied the coast down to the Kaveri river by 1463, nearly cutting Vijayanagar off from the ocean. Most of these territories proved too hard to defend and were abandoned, but some, like the Reddy Kingdoms of Kondavidu and Rajahmundry, remained part of Orissa for generations.

This alliance came to an end in 1459 when the new Sultan, Humayun Shah, invaded Debarkonda, a region ruled by the Velama. The Velama were a Hindu people who lived in Rajahkonda and Devarkonda, two small buffer states that maintained their independence by playing off the powers against each other. The chief of Debarkonda sought help from Orissa and in return the King sent his son Hamvira to Debarkdonda. After their victory Debarkonda became a client state of the Kingdom.;x

EVENTNAME249021;The Garhjat Rebellion;x
EVENTHIST249021;The Ganga rulers of Orissa managed to replace the tribal chiefs of the Mandala, or middle region, with a feudal caste of nayaka, but the tributary chiefs in the mountainous hinterland proved more resistant. The Garhjat, or 'gada jata' (castle-born) occasionally rebelled against the centralization of the state. During Prataprudra's reign the Garhjat states again rebelled.

EVENTHIST249023;While Prataprudra was busy fighting the Hindus in the south, the Sultan of Bengal took the opportunity to invade from the north. Before a decisive battle could be fought Prataprudra was forced to rush north. Although the Sultan was driven out of Orissa, the exhausted army was easily defeated by the Vijayanagar forces. This easy victory over Orissa emboldened the new ruler of Vijayanagar and he returned to Orissa twice again, conquering Udayagiri in 1512, Kondavidu in 1515, Simhachalam in 1516 and Kalak in 1519.;x

EVENTHIST249024;In his last campaign against Orissa the Vijayanagar ruler Krishnadeva Raya reached the city of Kalak and burned it to the ground. Seeking an end to war between them, the two rulers agreed on a treaty in which the river Krishna was set as the southern boundary of Orissa, legitimizing the conquests of Vijayanagar. To seal the deal the Oriya King's daughter Jaganmohini married Krishnadeva Raya. Although it was a one-sided deal, it gave Prataprudra the breathing space he needed to defend Orissa against the increasingly aggressive Golconda.;x

EVENTNAME249101;Elephant raids;x
EVENTHIST249101;Orissa was famous for its elephants and often called the Kingdom of the Gajapatis, or Elephant Lords. Although this made the Kingdom strong it also made it the target of other nations which frequently raided Orissa to gain war elephants, often as ransom for powerful nobles taken in raids. The worst offender was the Sharqi Sultan of Jaunpur but others also posed a threat.;x

EVENTNAME249102;Bhakti Cults and Brahminism;x
EVENTHIST249102;A popular offshoot of Hinduism, Bhakti cults refused to divide people into castes and saw them as equals - although in practice there were still great differences between nobles and peasants. The cults had all but died out across India by the fifteenth century, but continued to dominate Orissa. Even there the Bhakti were losing ground to mainstream Hinduism as tribal deities were edged out in favor of Brahminical gods. At the same time popular religion became increasingly dominated by ritual and ceremonial pomp that required the presence of a priestly caste. The result was a formalized caste system with the Brahmins on top and very little social mobility. Although this made Orissa's faith more palatable to other Hindus it also eroded their unique culture. One way for the Bhakti to win back the populace was through royal support. As the servants of Purusottama, Oriya Kings built glorious Bhakti temples.;x

EVENTNAME249501;Oriya Literature;x
EVENTHIST249501;From the ninth through at least the thirteenth centuries, there was an active cult of yoginis in India that taught Tantric practices designed to give supernatural abilities to masters. Although the cult largely died out in mainstream India, it flourished in centers such as Orissa as late as the 16th century. Sharala Das was an Oriya scholar-priest who wrote the Chandi Purana and translated the Mahabharata into Oriya in the mid 15th century. These texts had a profound influence on Oriya religion but also helped pave the way for the rise of Oriya literature in the 16th century.;x

He started his career as a cook, then moved to the Treasury. A pasha in central Anatolia, he gained a name for himself as an excellent and honest administrator--a rare creature in the Ottoman Empire. Governor of Damascus, he was called by the mother of the young sultan Mehmed IV as Grand Vizier on 15th September 1656. A fierce fighter of corruption, he enacted many successful reforms, balanced the budget and led the war against Venice. After his death in 1661, his son Fazil Ahmed 'the Virtuous' succeeded him and governed till 1676. Other Grand Viziers such as Kara Mustafa (1676-1683), Mustafa Pasha (1689-1691) and Hussein Pasha (1697-1702) were his direct heirs.;x

EVENTNAME3393;Lale Devri - The Tulip Era;x
EVENTHIST3393;Under the rule of Sultan Ahmed III and Sadrazam Damat Ibrahim Pasha, the Ottoman Empire entered a period of unprecedented westernization. The printing press, previously outlawed by the Sheikh-ul-Islams, is introduced to the nation's capital. Ambassadors were sent to Western European nations for the first time in history. Modern textile, paper and porcelain manufactories were built. Despite these improvements, much of the treasury was also wasted on new palaces, gardens and parks in Istanbul.

It was intended that Dracul be brought in chains before the Sultan and forced to swear fealty, using his sons as hostages, however, the wily Dragon avoided the trap. However, his emissary still acknowledges a debt of gratitude to the Sublime Porte, and realizing our superiority, has offered to send Radu to our court to be raised properly.;x

EVENTNAME19008;Suleyman demands the keys to Hungary;x
EVENTHIST19008;When Suleyman I became Sultan of the Ottoman Empire in 1520, he was faced with a grave crisis. The rise of the Habsburgs in Austria and Spain had created a superpower. Moreover, the Habsburgs had a potential claim to the Hungarian throne. Should the Habsburgs seize that throne, their armies would be within striking distance of Constantinople itself. In order to fend off this developing threat, Ottoman diplomats strove to strengthen relations with Venice and France. Hungary, however, must pay tribute to the Sultan, must grant the Ottoman troops transit rights through their country, and must renounce all ties with the Habsburgs. If they refused, war would surely follow.;x

EVENTNAME19010;Lajos insults Suleyman;x
EVENTHIST19010;When King Lajos of Hungary refused to answer the Sultan's ambassador, the Ottoman Empire had no option but to go to war. It was thought that the seizure of a few key forts would be enough to bring the Hungarians to heel. But things would not be that simple.;x

EVENTNAME19019;The Death of János Zápolya;x
EVENTHIST19019;Zápolya's reign was contested from the very beginning. In 1538, Zápolya had secretly promised Ferdinand of Austria the Hungarian crown in order to buy peace. In 1540, while putting down a revolt in Transylvania, János died from illness, just three weeks after his Polish princess-bride had given him a son, János Sigusmund. With Zapolya's death, Ferdinand again invaded Hungary to try to claim his inheritance. Finally the Ottoman Sultan, having had enough with the chaos in his vassal, Hungary, split the country into three parts. He kept Southern and Central Hungary for himself, giving Eastern Hungary to János Sigusmund, while Ferdinand held the Western portion. Hungary would remain divided between the three countries for the next 170 years.;x

EVENTHIST23014;Artillery had become increasingly useful over the previous 150 years, and were now beginning to have a major impact on sieges. In 1452, a Hungarian engineer named Urban approached Constantine XI with a proposal for a major artillery development program. The cash-strapped emperor could not afford to finance it, and instead Urban went to Mehmed II. Mehmed was delighted to finance Urban, who eventually created a cannon with a 27 foot barrel that shot 1200 pound balls.;x

Having defeated Safavid Persia, he turned to the Mamluk Empire. At that time, the Mamluk state already was in a state of anarchy and its armies hopelessly inferior to those of the Ottomans, and thus Selim's armies rushed through its defenses at an incredible speed. On August 24 the Syrian army led by the Sultan himself who got killed in that battle was destroyed near Aleppo, the city of Damaskus conquered on October 12th and the rest of Syria and Palestina quickly overrun.

EVENTHIST301023;The Ottoman Sultan Selim I was determined to eliminate all potential enemies in the east in order to be able to overrun Europe without fearing an attack from the other direction. Having defeated Safavid Persia, he turned to the Mamluk Empire. At that time, the Mamluk state already was in a state of anarchy and its armies hopelessly inferior to those of the Ottomans, and thus Selim's armies rushed through its defenses at an incredible speed. On August 24 the Syrian army led by the Sultan himself who got killed in that battle was destroyed near Aleppo, the city of Damaskus conquered on October12th and the rest of Syria and Palestina quickly overrun. After wintering in Damaskus, Selim progressed to Egypt. On January21st, the last remaining Mamluk army engaged for the final battle near Radania and was decisively defeated. This battle marked the end of the Mamluk Empire. Selim offered vassal status to the last Sultan Tumanbeg.

But the main problem was that neither Spain nor the Ottoman Empire could afford to continue such expensive war at a time when both their economies were in trouble, and both had more pressing matters. For Spain it was the rebellion in the Low Countries, and for the Ottoman Empire the Persian wars and the rebellions in the Balkans. Under these circumstances, Felipe II and Murad III negotiated a series of truces between 1577 and 1581. In these truces Felipe II renounced to Spanish former conquests in North Africa, while the Ottoman sultan renounced to Oran, and to lend help to the Moriscos.

During these tumultuous years, the entire Morea revolted against the Ottomans. The territories of Patra, Mystras, Corinth, Sparta, and Argos were liberated. After the end of the Turco-Venetian War, the Venetians left the Maniots to fend for themselves. Many of the Greeks who had revolted alongside the Venetians were massacred by the Ottomans, but many of them fled to find refuge in Mani. Korkodeilos Kladas never accepted the clauses of the agreement made between the Turks and the Venetians. He not only refused Turkish offers, but he also began to revolt against them. On the 9th October 1480, Kladas and his followers gathered an army and captured all the Turkish held castles in the Morea. The Ottoman government was enraged. An army sent by the Sultan was defeated between Passavas and Oitylo during February of 1481. Later that month a bigger force under Mohammed Bey drove Kladas to Porto Kagio.

Murad II demanded that Despot Djuradj joins his invasion Bosnia and Hungary and allows unhindered passage of Ottoman troops through Serbia. After failing in attempts to secure Serbia's neutrality in the war, Despot Djuradj submitted to Sultan's wishes and joined him in war against Hungary and Bosnia.;x

EVENTNAME301104;Muslims admitted to the Janissary;x
EVENTHIST301104;The janissaries (from Yani Ceri or new army) were the elite of the Ottoman army. They were recruited as children from the Christians, from raid prisoners and through the devshirmeh, a children tax levy imposed on the Christian subjects. Their training was very hard and their quality outstanding. After the first revolt of the janissaries in 1449 they started to acquire power and prestige and some Muslims found the way for their sons to be admitted. After the great wars of Selim and Suleyman, Muslims started to be admitted openly to increase the size of the Janissary beyond what the devshirmeh could provide. This apparently innocuous measure changed the peculiar status of the Janissary breaking the balance of power in their favor. The slow decadence of the Janissary was only one of the factors in the Ottoman decline, but a fine ruler could steer the Empire even if he takes the historical decisions.;x
ACTIONNAME301104A;More janissaries are surely better for the country;x
ACTIONNAME301104B;Better keep the elite corps small and under control;x

EVENTNAME301105;Timar crisis;x
EVENTHIST301105;The lands gained through conquest belonged to the sultan, and they were assigned to soldiers according to the timar system. The timariots could enjoy the land and its peasants as serfs for life, but both lands and serfs reverted to the sultan at their death. The timariots were responsible for production and tax collection, and had to provide also soldiers for the sultan's army. This system proved to be a great source of income and an incentive for new conquests. But by 1550 the timar system entered a crisis. Lack of new conquests from the Christians and a population boom from 12 to 22 million, strained the resources increasing unemployment and dropping wages, while new taxes were imposed to support the huge military expenses. Timars became less productive, abandoned by the peasants, or converted into hereditary chiftliks (large private estates made out of Timar land). The loss of power by the impoverished Turkish nobility and their sipahi cavalry left the janissaries as the main force.;x
ACTIONNAME301105A;We need constant conquests!;x
#;x
EVENTNAME301106;Janissaries allowed to marry;x
EVENTHIST301106;The admittance of Muslims into the Janissary brought an unexpected problem as part of them were married. The restrictions to marry became more lax and finally the janissaries were able to extract from Selim II a general permission to all janissaries to marry. The janissaries, now with families to take care of, lost a great deal of warrior ardour. Their cost also raised greatly, as their adequate salary became insufficient to support a family. More problems followed as the janissaries insisted in their sons being admitted, and soon obtained it. The transformation from a military elite into a powerful and dangerous conservative guild was taking place and was accompanied by an increasing difficulty in obtaining victories at war.;x
ACTIONNAME301106A;No longer an elite corps;x
#;x
EVENTNAME301107;Price revolution crisis;x
EVENTHIST301107;In 1584, unable to meet the costs of the Persian wars and with a reduced tax base due to the timariot crisis, the Divan or High Council ordered a debasement of the coin. It was a huge mistake. The ratio of the akche to the ducat went soon from 60 to 200. Together with the overabundance of precious metals, the prices increased sharply, and the low wages ruined the people. Nobody understood the problem and the coinage debasements continued. In 70 years inflation rose 500 percent. Tax pressure increased to compensate for the loss of income. The ruined peasants abandoned the fields forming vagrant bands (levendat). Population decreased and instability rose, triggering multiple revolts. The damage was very profound since the crisis lasted almost a century.;x
ACTIONNAME301107A;Rats!;x
#;x
EVENTNAME301108;The Janissary rebellion of 1589;x
EVENTHIST301108;The military was also affected by the economical crisis, and after the war with Persia the Janissary started to seize lands illegally. In 1589 the janissaries rebelled on claims that they were being robbed from their pay, because salary was given in debased coinage. Three years later the sipahi also mutinied because they were not given their full pay. In 1596, 30,000 sipahi refused to fight at Mezo-Keresztes in Hungary. Yet the janissaries forcefully resisted any attempt of reformation.;x
ACTIONNAME301108A;The army refuses to fight unless paid in full in advance;x

EVENTNAME301109;Agricultural crisis and famine;x
EVENTHIST301109;The price revolution crisis soon led to deteriorating living conditions and peasant oppression. As the Ottoman taxation system was based on agriculture the preassure on country laborers became unbearable and was increased by widespread corruption. The conditions for Christian peasants were worse, and the Balkans impoverished. Marginal farmlands were abandoned to stocks, and a general decline of agriculture took place, especially commercial agriculture, causing widespread famine and population decline. In Anatolia and Smyrna wandering bands of landless peasants with military experience (levendat) became the ferment for the Celali revolts. The Ottoman Government went from having the highest income in Europe to being permanently strapped for cash.;x

EVENTNAME301110;The sultan dies at the hands of the Janissaries;x
EVENTHIST301110;Osman II started a campaign against his vassals of Moldavia and Wallachia, but was defeated by the Poles at Khotyn, Ukraine in 1621, when the janissaries broke and fled the battle. Realizing what was the problem he started to reform the Janissary. When he met strong opposition, he announced his pilgrimage to Mecca, with the secret intention of recruiting a new army in Egypt and Syria to break the Janissary. But he did not fool the janissaries and they revolted and strangled him. Osman was the first sultan to die at the hands of his janissaries, but would not be the last. In total four sultans were killed and four more lost their thrones due to the Janissary. The janissaries became more dangerous to their own country than to any other. Did Osman have a chance against the Janissary?;x

EVENTNAME301111;Janissaries engage in trade;x
EVENTHIST301111;With families to support, in the midst of an economical crisis, and with problems to get their payment, the janissaries looked for additional sources of income, and they had the power to take them from others. In addition to land ownership, soon they also took to trade. The members of each orta (regiment) engaged in the same trade and soon started monopolistic practices. By 1634 the janissaries controlled many guilds in Istanbul, like the butchers, fruit and vegetables and coffee-roasting. Once they were able to secure the duty-free importing of goods, a big part of the international trade also fell in their hands. With economic power they attracted all classes and soon corruption took over the enlistment process.;x

EVENTNAME301112;Janissaries oppose reforms;x
EVENTHIST301112;With the admittance of the sons of Janissaries, the former rigorous and harsh training that had guaranteed the quality of the corps had entered decadence, as the fathers did not want to impose on their sons the almost brutal training that the Janissary academy, the Acemi Oglan, required in the past. During the war against Venice, and while the janissaries deposed and killed sultan Ibrahim, attempts were made to improve the training and increase its duration, but the cadets at the Acemi Oglan rebelled twice, in 1657 and 1659, to oppose such changes. As a result, while the western armies were introducing the reforms pioneered by Maurice of Nassau, of the Netherlands and Gustav Adolf of Sweden, the Ottoman army remained in the past, ignoring the military revolutions introduced since the Italian wars.;x
ACTIONNAME301112A;We are falling back;x
#;x
EVENTNAME301113;End of the devshirmeh;x
EVENTHIST301113;Despite their obvious decadence, the Janissary, allied to the Bektashi order of dervishes (Muslim monks) and the Ulema (learned), as defenders of the old tradition, conserved and increased their reputation, associated by people with the former glory of the past Muslim victories, and resisted any reformation attempt until their end in 1826. During the disastrous war against Austria and Poland of 1683-1698 the rules of admission were suspended, and the janissaries doubled their size. The devshirmeh or Christian boys levy was gradually abandoned. From then on, only sons of the janissaries, family members, or those who bought admission could enter this social elite. For all practical purposes the Janissary had become hereditary, and their numbers continued to increase.;x
ACTIONNAME301113A;The old ways are tried and true;x
#;x
EVENTNAME301114;Hyperinflation and nationalism;x
EVENTHIST301114;In 1780, under financial constrains after the Russian war over Crimea, the Ottoman government started to resort to currency debasement. The resulting inflation and the rebellions that it caused, together with more wars prompted more debasements until 1850 creating a massive hyperinflation of 1,200 to 1,500 percent leading to the replacement of the Akche by the Kurus, at a rate of 120 to one, and exacerbating every problem in the Ottoman Empire. Eventually even the British Pound was affected by this crisis that led to lack of foreign credit by the Ottoman government and temporary foreign financial control of the debt administration in 1881. This long economical crisis marks the lowest point of the Ottoman Empire, and coincides with a period of extreme difficulty characterized by Anatolian and Balkan uprisings, Greek and Serbian independentism and wars against Russia, Iran and Egypt. Given the evident decline, strong attempts at reformation were made in the XIX century, but they came too late for the Empire.;x

EVENTNAME301116;The destruction of the Janissary;x
EVENTHIST301116;The Janissary rebellion of 1589 made the sultans aware that the Janissary had become an obsolete corps. Not only they were not performing as well as they used to, but they had also become very dangerous to their own country, periodically rebelling to increase their privileges and opposing any reform. Sultan Ahmed now was thankful that his predecessors had chosen to keep the Janissary closed to all but the devshirme, as they had not been allowed to grow out of control. For ten years Mehmed III, his father, had planned their destruction, gathering enough loyal forces to confront them. However at the last moment he lacked the courage to carry on. Ahmed is aware that the Janissary has the support of the Ulema (learned), the Bektashi order of dervishe (monks), ample parts of the population that sees them as Islam fighters responsible for the glorious past against the Christians, and more importantly, a big part of the military that will fight at their side...;x

Of all those leaders, he was most lax towards Despot Djuradj, probably because of influence his late father's wife, Mara Brankovic, who taught him about European culture.

He died in November 1443 without a male heir, but he outlived Hermann of Cilli who was supposed to inherit Bosnia in such case. With Hungary loosing a war against Ottoman Empire, Emperor Albrecht I was not in a position to press the claims of Hermann's successors. The only two remaining choices were the two sons of Stefan Ostoja, Tvrtko's predecessor, Radivoj and Tomas. King Tvrtko choose the aggressive and ambitious Radivoj, our loyal vassal, as his successor.;x

EVENTNAME301123;Serbia submits yet again;x
EVENTHIST301123;After 1454, the political sentiment among Serbian nobility began to change. After many years of Hungarian failure to protect Serbia against Ottoman onslaught and with great support from Djuradj's daughter Mara, Serbian nobles began thinking that honest and loyal alliance with Ottoman Empire is the best option for Serbia. Internal conflicts of Hungary and actions of disloyal Lord of Belgrade against Despot Djuradj only strenghtened Turkophilic nobles in Serbia. Sultan Memhed II, aware of this change and with most of Serbia under his control, offered Despot Djuradj to let him rule a smaller despotate but with reduced tribute. Despot initially agreed, but changed his mind as Ottoman army was crossing Serbia to attack Belgrade. After suffering great losses in defense of Smederevo and Belgrade and even more to the plague that came afterwards and also took life of Janos Hunyadi, Despot Djuradj was forced to negotiate and new peace and vassalage with Ottoman Empire. He was stopped by death in 1456.;x

His failure to join the League of Cambrai against Venice and take back Dalmatia was not well-received. Submitting to be the vassal of the heathen Turks was the last straw. On August, 22, 1526, King Lajos of Hungary and Bohemia was assassinated by a conspiracy of nobles. With Lajos II dead, Suleyman ordered the nobility of Hungary to chose whomever they wished to be King, so long as he was not a Habsburg. Most of the nobles voted for János Zápolya of Transylvania swearing allegiance to the Sultan.;x

He cautioned Ismail that should he refuse to comply, the city fortifications would not withstand the powerful assembled army. Ismail agreed to the grand vezir's generous terms and the Candar beylik came to an end. True to his word, Ismail was assigned territory in the Balkans, while his rebellious brother, Ahmad, was assigned Candar.

EVENTHIST255002;On December 1st 1503 Duke Georg the Rich of Bayern-Landshut died without a male successor. Despite several treaties made in the 15th century that should secure the inheritance for Bavaria-Munich he declared his daughter Elisabeth and her husband, the palatine elector Ruprecht, heirs of his duchy. This caused a war between the palatine and the bavarian Wittelsbach branches for the inheritance. The Palatinate eventually prevailed and managed to secure Landshut.;x

EVENTHIST255003;On December 30th 1777 Duke Maximilian III Joseph, the last Bavarian Wittelsbach, died. By virtue of a contract signed in 1724 for the case of one Wittelsbach dynasty, dying out, the Palatine Elector Karl Theodor was the legitimate heir, with the condition, that he moved his court to Munich so that Bavaria could remain the main Wittelsbach country. Karl Theodor acknowledged the terms of the contract, making the Palatinate a mere, side country, although he loved his residence in Mannheim and felt like a stranger, among strangers in Munich.

EVENTNAME255010;The marriage with Mary of Burgundy;x
EVENTHIST255010;Mary of Valois was the only daughter of Charles le Téméraire (Charles the Rush) and so heiress of all the rich Burgundian domains from the Saone River up to the Low Countries. After her father prematurely died, Mary was only nineteen and Louis XI of France seized the opportunity to take possession of the duchy of Burgundy and also of Franche-Comté, Picardie and Artois. He justified his military intervention with the fact that these lands had always been fiefs to the French crown and that with Charles' death, the last member of the French Valois dynasty they had 'de facto', according to the salic law, reverted to France. But the choice of which prince should marry the Archduchess would be of particular importance for the future political and economical stability of Western Europe, so he urged Mary to accept his son, the Dauphin Charles, as husband, in order to secure the inheritance of the Low Countries for his descendants too, even by force of arms if necessary. Mary, however, distrusted Louis and declined any French support and offer of marriage but, in order to be recognized as legitimate ruler over the Low Countries and to get financial and military help of Flemish cities against the French aggression, she made so great concessions as to reduce the Burgundian states effectively to a sort of federation of provinces. Satisfied that the country was sufficiently weakened and disorganized, Louis XI ordered his army into Artois and Hainault, but the imminence of danger seemed to revive in the Burgundian provinces a spirit of loyalty towards the Valois heiress and arrangements were made for the marriage of Mary with Philipp der Edelmütige, Elector Palatine who would provide substantial diplomatic and military resources to withstand any French aggression.;x

He becomes one of the most devoted counter reformists and enemy #1 of the protestant movement. Loyola having a soldier background makes its mark on the order, which is organized almost as an army. High priority was given both to educating missionaries but also counselors for European royal courts. This made the Jesuite order very powerful in the politic scene. 1773 the Jesuite order was dissolved by Pope Pius VI due to pressure from Christian countries in the age of enlightenment. 1814 the Jesuite order was reinstituted, however just as a faint shadow of the powerful order it once had been.;x

After a first failure in the summer of 1570, Pope Pius V managed to convince major Catholic nations (except France) to join a Holy League against the heathens Turks, and it was proclaimed in May 1571. The League would lead to the great naval victory of Don Juan on the Turks at Lepanto, but would not outlast this first and final triumph. Selim II is rumored to have said, after the news he had lost 200 galleys at Lepanto: At Lepanto, the Christians have shaved me. At Cyprus, I cut their arm. My beard will grow again.;x

This marked the beginning of a few highly volatile decades in European history while the two sides of Reformed and Counter reformed fight each other. At the same time there were forces within the Catholic Church wanting a reform to remedy the corruption and other bad conditions present. Thus 1545 the Council of Trient is opened.

EVENTHIST5224;The Accademia dei Lincei was founded in 1603 in Rome by the young Prince Federico Cesi and his friends, Anastasio Di Filiis, Johannes Van Heeck, and Francesco Stelluti. It aimed at a radical renewal of scientific knowledge and it encouraged a vigorous critical approach to the dominant Aristotelian philosophy. They chose the lynx as their emblem, to stress the importance of sharp and penetrating insight into nature. The Academy realized the revolutionary importance of the celestial discoveries that Galileo made with his new telescope in 1610. Nevertheless, the Academy did not survive the death of Prince Federico Cesi in 1630.;x

He made a series of telescopes with which he saw mountains on the Moon, proved the Milky Way was made up of tiny stars, and saw four small bodies orbiting Jupiter. Galileo became 'Mathematician and Philosopher' to the Grand Duke of Tuscany. In Florence he continued his work on motion and mechanics and began to get involved in disputes about Copernicanism. Copernicanism was in contradiction with Scripture, and in 1616 Galileo was given some kind of warning that he was not to defend Copernicanism. Just what was said on this occasion was to become a subject for dispute when Galileo was accused of departing from this undertaking in his 'Dialogue concerning the two greatest world systems'. In October 1632 he was summoned by the Holy Office to Rome. The tribunal passed a sentence condemning him and compelled Galileo to abjure his theory.;x

EVENTNAME17024;The Holy League against France;x
EVENTHIST17024;In 1510 Venice submitted to the Pope, thus lessening the league of Cambrai. Conditions were hard for Venice, the Republic had to renounce her traditional power to appoint bishops as well as all jurisdiction over Papal subjects in Venetian territory and was to compensate Pope Julius II for his war expenses needed to recapture the Papal holdings in Romagna, while the Pope accepted the humble request of the Republic for pardon, cancelling the interdict. But the reconciliation between Venice and the Pope did not stop the French to continue the war against Venice with attacks to her cities in Terraferma. Julius II, in the meanwhile, had become increasingly concerned by the growing French presence in Italy and formulated plans, both to chase the French out of the Po Valley and to seize the Duchy of Ferrara, a French ally, with the intention to add the territories of Modena, Reggio and Ferrara to the Papal States. In realizing his plan the Pope immediately excommunicated Alfonso d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, declaring his fief forfeited for his remaining loyal to France, then he gained the military support of Venice, eager to recover her territories lost to the French a armies and hired an army of Swiss mercenaries to attack Milan as to isolate the French armies in Italy. However his plans failed as the French army managed to invade Romagna and occupy the cities of Bologna and Ravenna, supported by the powerful and celebrated artillery of Duke Alfonso d'Este. In addition, in response to Pope's switching sides, Louis XII of France convoked a Schismatic Council at Pisa as to have the 'Warrior Pope' deposed. Pope Julius II, having unsuccessfully pressed the Republic of Florence to refuse hosting the schismatic cardinals, proclaimed the Holy League against France and convoked a Council of his own to meet at the Lateran in Rome. The promise of territorial gains at French expense caused Ferdinand II of Aragon and Emperor Maximilian I to abandon their alliance with the French, and in October 1511, they joined the newly-formed Holy League together with Julius II and the Republic of Venice. In November, Henry VIII of England and the Swiss confederation joined as well.;x

EVENTHIST17360;In the 1470's Papal power expanded into many towns that were on the Tuscan border, causing much concern in Florence. Lorenzo de' Medici, who ran Florence, stopped serving as the Popes banker, and allowed the Popes opponents to raise troops in Tuscany. Florence then refused to accept the papal nominee as archbishop, and organized an alliance between the major powers of Northern Italy - Milan Venice and Florence, that threatened the expansion of papal authority. In early 1477 the Pope met with members of the Pazzi family, who proposed to overthrow and replace Lorenzo de' Medici in Florence. They told the Pope that they would have to kill the Medici, and he did not oppose their plan. In April 1478 at high mass in the cathedral of Florence the conspirators attacked Giuliano and Lorenzo de' Medici as the host was elevated. Giuliano was killed by a mercenary, but the two priests assigned to kill Lorenzo only wounded him in the neck. What should we do about the proposal to kill the Medici?;x

EVENTHIST17387;The series of Jubilees celibrated in Rome by the Catholic Church was not initiated by the Pope or the Roman Curia, but by 'the people'. On Christmas night of 1299 Pilgrims and the citizens of Rome gathered in St Peter's Basilica, they were convinced that the church ought to grant something special at the beginning of 1300. Pope Boniface VIII proclaimed a Holy Year, which involved pilgrimages to the Basilicas of St Peter and St Paul and the granting of indulgences. The Jubilee of 1423 was proclaimed by Martin V to celebrate the end of the Schism when the Anit-Popes John XXIII and Benedict XIII were deposed by the council of Constance. The basilica of St John Lateran was opened for the first time.;x

EVENTHIST17388;Proclaimed by Nicholas V, who brought back the Jubilee to the 50 year cycle. There was a great flow of pilgrims but in summer a plague claimed many victims. When it abated, the number of pilgrims increased again. Among them were St Rita of Cascia, St John Capistran, St Catherine of Bologna, King Ferdinand of Naples, Queen Carlotta of Cyprus, Blessed Angelico who painted some papal rooms for that occassion.

All other indulgences were suspended for this occassion. For the first time the Papal Bull was printed, a system which Guttenburg created in 1469 by inventing the movable type. The Pope had frescoes painted on the walls of the Sistine Chapel by Sandro Botticelli, Domenico Ghirlandaio, Cosimo Rosselli and Pietro Perugino. The Tibur overflowed its banks and the basilica of St Paul could be reached only by boat.;x

This Jubilee saw 2 Popes just like the 3rd (1390) and the 10th (1550). It was an austere Jubilee without revelry. Innocent was a very pious Pope who condemned nepotism explicitly. He created the Congregation for Religious and condemned Jansenism. He died a saintly man. Participating in the Jubilee were Queen Maria Casimir of Poland with two sons, visiting the basilicas barefooted. The Grand Duke of Tuscany Cosmos III came and was made a canon of St Peter's.

EVENTNAME17397;Jubilee 1725;x
EVENTHIST17397;Proclaimed by Benedict XIII, an austere dominican who would kneel when writing to his Superior General. The Pope wanted an austere Jubilee without the usual illuminations and pageantry. During the Holy Year, a council of italian bishops was called at St John Lateran to legislate matters on discipline and catechetics. Clerics were prohibited from wearing wigs and playing the lottery. The Congregation of Mercedaraians managed to collect sufficient money to redeem 3,710 slaves who arrived in Rome from Tunisia. They were blessed by the Pope and each received a medal and a sum of money. For the first time a trained horse was given to the Pope by the King of Naples in the Piazza Santi Apostoli. 10 saints were canonised among whom were St Pellegrino Laziosi, St John of the Cross, St Louis Gonzaga, St Stanislaw Kostka, St John Nepomuceno.;x

EVENTNAME17399;Jubilee 1775;x
EVENTHIST17399;Proclaimed by Clement XIV who died on Sep 22nd 1774. He organised the Missions in the 4 piazzas of Rome and wanted to personally help in it. Before his death he was obliged to suppress the Company of Jesus much to his relutance (1773). The suppression was required to keep the unity of the Church during the reactionary events that overtook society. The Jubilee was celebrated in subdued tones by Pius VI who was elected on Feb 15th 1775. About 300,000 pilgrims were at the Jubilee. Holy Thursday saw a procession of 100 oriental bishops in their splendid vestments. Numbered among the pilgrims was Maximillian of Austria. Confessors were authorised to grant dispensation to pilgrims regarding the visits to the 4 basilicas in particular cases.;x

EVENTNAME17400;The Borgias;x
EVENTHIST17400;The second Borgia Pope, Rodrigo, was the nephew of Callixtus III, and assumed the Pontificate under the name of Alexander VI. He had employed bribery to purchase votes, a practice known as simony, and not uncommon at the time. Alexander VI was famed for his pursuit of gold and women. He had fathered seven children, one of whom, the condottiere Cesare, was elevated to the status of Captian-General of the Papal armies, while another son, Jofre, was married into the Aragonese royal family. Alexander was a ruthless, yet gifted ruler whose goal was the complete subjugation of the Papal state by whatever means necessary, including murder.

While possibly the victim of anti-Borgia propaganda, it is certain the she was a gifted administrator who ably assisted the government of Alexander, her father, as well that of her various husbands.

EVENTNAME17404;The Warrior Pope;x
EVENTHIST17404;In August 1503, Alexander VI and his son both fell ill. Alexander and Cesare had dined with Cardinal Adrian Corneto at the latter's villa. It had long been believed that the Borgia intended to make Corneto their next victim. Corneto swithed a cup with the Borgias that he believed had been poisoned. Cesare recovered from his illness, while Alexander died at 77. Alexander was succeded briefly by Pius III. Pius quicky died, then the bitter enemy of the Borgias, Giulano della Rovere ascended the throne of St. Peter as Julius II. Julius was first and foremost a warrior who personally led the Papal armies. Paradoxically, he completed the work of the Borgias by bringing Papal territories firmly under the influence of Rome. He was in addition a patron of the arts (Raphael, Michaelangelo, and Bramante enjoyed his patronage). Julius also made efforts to suppress the corruption, simony, and nepotism which had run rampant in Rome.;x

EVENTHIST17405;Callixtus III was soon known to be politically ruthless and greedy (survival traits in Italian politics). In an effort to organize a Crusade to liberate Constantinople from the Turks, he resorted to selling indulgences, cardinalates, annulments, grants of papal terretory, works of art, and even valuable books. These methods, together with the imposition of heavy taxes made him unpopular both at home and abroad. It was apparent that enthusiasm for participation in a Crusade was not high among the Christian Princes of Europe.;x

EVENTNAME17406;Charles V's Mercenary Army Sacks Rome;x
EVENTHIST17406;The 14,000 lansquenets, hired by Charles V in the war against the League of Cognac under the command of Georg von Frundsberg, were animated by a violent spirit of crusade against the Pope (Frundsberg was bringing a golden rope with which he insanely meant to hang the Pope and his cardinals!) but also, and most of all, angry for lack of pay. Abandoned by their captains, they begun to plunder villages in search of loots. Soon they were joined by 6,000 Spanish soldiers lead by Charles, Connétable de Bourbon, and by any sort of ruffians of any condition (mercenaries at the Emperor's service, diserting or disbanded troops of the League and common criminals), all of them with the common aim to make the way to Rome, the city of sin, and 'sack' it. On the morning of 6 May 1527, from his headquarters set up on the Gianicolo hill, Captain General Bourbon with his 40,000 soldiers launched a series of attacks on Rome. During one of them, at the Torrione Gate, while leading the assault of the walls, he himself was mortally wounded (Benvenuto Cellini, who took part in the defence of the walls, would boast about having shot the deadly bullet). Instead of being let down, the Spanish troops' confidence was boosted by their commander's sudden death and at the expenses of big losses, managed to break through the city walls and enter the Borgo while the imperial lansquenets broke rushed towards the Holy See. Pope Clement VII and his followers were able to escape into safety, thanks to the 'Passetto', a secret corridor which Pope Alexander VI had built along the top of the wall connecting the Vatican with Castel Sant'Angelo. Across the Sisto bridge the bewildered soldiers fell on the unarmed city and for eight days committed every sort of violence, theft, sacrilege and massacre. The streets were a mixture of drunken soldiers, corpses and heaps of every sort of luxury goods taken from churches, monasteries and palaces. No league army dared to enter the city to drive out the ravaging troops and rescue the Pope, who accepted to pay a huge ransom only six months later.;x

EVENTHIST251000;Alum was a salt essential for dyes. Until 1460, nearly all European supplies of the mineral came from Asia minor near Smyrna (modern Izmir). In 1455 control of the trade passed from the Genoese to the Ottomans. In 1460, immense deposits were found in Tolfa, a town near Civitavecchia in Lazio. In 1466, the Pope signed an agreement with a consortium led by his primary bankers, the Medici, to mine and export the alum. At this time the Medici were the predominant family in Florence, and Piero de' Medici controlled Tuscan policy.;x

EVENTNAME251001;Duarte of Portugal requests concession of Canary islands;x
EVENTHIST251001;The claim to the Canary Islands was disputed for a very long time. Portugal argued that they were closer to their coasts, while Castile argued that they belonged to the diocese of Tingitania (Morocco) and were therefore part of the Visigothic Kingdom to which they were entitled, and both monarchs contested the decision of Pope Clement VI to give the islands to Luis de la Cerda, a Spanish nobleman, in 1344. But their hostile natives prevented any settlement, and nothing was done until French noblemen Jean de Bethencourt disembarks in Lanzarote in 1402. Being succesful in the conquest of the island, he travelled the next year to Castile, and obtained from Enrique III the concession for the conquest of the islands in his name. He managed to conquer another three islands. But the three bigger islands could not be conquered, as resistance from the natives, of pre-islamic Berber origen, was strong. With the African explorations of Don Henrique, the Canary islands constituted a convenient base, and Henrique sent two expeditions, in 1424 and 1427, that failed due to native resistance and lack of supplies. When Duarte became King in 1433, he activated his diplomacy, and was granted by Pope Eugenius IV, the right to Christianize the islands that remained pagan, given the success of Portugal against the North African Muslims.;x

EVENTHIST251002;When Juan II of Castile found out that the Pope had given Duarte of Portugal the right to conquer some of the Canary islands, he sent his best ambassador, Alonso de Cartagena, to try to revert the decision. Curiously, the main argument used by Alonso was not that those islands were part of a group already half conquered by Castile, but that the right of Castile to the islands had the same basis that the right the monarchs of Castile had over their Kingdom, that they inherited from the Visigoth Kings, and these from the Roman Emperors. The argument must have been a good one, because Eugenius IV, knee deep in his problems with the Council of Basel, reversed his previous decision and published a bull in 1436 recognizing the rights of Castile to all the islands and exhorting Portugal to not enter a war with Castile over them. There would still be a couple of failed attempts at their conquest by the Portuguese in 1448 and 1455, but with the finding of better islands in the coast of Africa to act as bases, the interest for the Canary islands decayed. Meanwhile the Castilians were advancing all the time in their settlement, and finally between 1477 and 1496 the Catholic King's armies fully conquered the remaining islands.;x

It did not go well. Whether it was the Pope's thirst of power or the radicalism of the conciliars theorists, no compromise was found. What should have been a great opportunity to reform the church and restore confidence just created more chaos. The last Antipope was elected in 1439 by the Council: Amadeus Duke of Savoy under the name of Felix V. He did not have a great success as an Antipope and submitted in 1449.

EVENTHIST251010;The Renaissance saw the recovery of the classical culture of the greek and roman antiquity. It was mostly a Italian phenomenon, but the center of the catholic church was Italian itself. The popes were promoting the arts and the letters. However, it could be said that they were also promoting luxury and immorality. When the German and very devout Luther visited Rome, he was striken by that kind of unChristian spirit. In fact, corruption, venality, nepotism and intrigues undermined the credibility of the Holy See in Europe throughout the Renaissance.

One year later, Luther had the support of many German princes and Rome began to worry. All these ideas of reform were becoming more and more radical. Luther got as far as to appeal the Emperor to destroy the power of the Pope. The 15 july of 1520, after careful scrutiny of his writings, Rome formally condemned forty-one propositions of Luther and summoned him to recant. It did no good, of course, but at the time there was already no space for a compromise. If the Pope had tried for such a compromise, it would have mean more trouble in Italy than peace in Germany.;x

France was at odds with the Pope, Burgundy delayed their help, Milan was trying to seize Genoa, and Florence cynically advised the Pope to let the Turks and the Venetians wear each other out. But the Venetians and the Hungarians signed their support in 1463. Thousands of destitute men from all of Europe came to the Pope's call and he led them to Ancona in the summer of 1464, where he became very ill. While waiting for the Venetian fleet, plague broke out and the crusade army melted away. On August 14, when the Venetians finally arrived, the Pope expired. Doge Christoforo Moro seeing no army and no fleet but his 12 galleys, took the 40,000 ducats collected to pay the Hungarians from the cardinals and returned home.;x

In 1583 he settled in Guangdong, studying the language and culture. He found ready acceptance among some officials, for the Chinese took an intense interest in his possessions, such as clocks and Western paintings. Only in 1601 he was allowed entrance to the capital Beijing at the Imperial court of Wanli. There he became a court mathematician and astronomer. Although he made few converts, he brought Christianity into good repute. Unlike missionaries in South Asia, he found that Chinese culture was strongly tied to Confucian values and concluded that Christianity had to be adapted to Chinese culture in order to take root. He called himself a Western Confucian. He was renowned for his great understanding of Chinese culture. He helped translate many Western works on mathematics and the sciences into Chinese. His maps were eagerly perused by the Chinese, who gained from him their first notion of modern Europe. In return, Ricci sent back to Europe the first modern detailed report on China. He composed a number of treatises, the principal being a catechism, True Doctrine of God, which was widely printed in China.;x

Well known in Rome and Naples, he then travelled to London, where he was initiated into Freemasonry and in The Hague he founded the Egyptian Rite of Freemasonry. He travelled also throughout Russia, Germany, and later France, spreading the influence of the Egyptian Rite and also claiming to be a magnetic healer of great power. In France he was prosecuted in the affair of the diamond necklace which involved Marie Antoinette, imprisoned for fraud, he was then acquitted. Asked to leave he went to England, where he managed to refute accusations made to him of being Giuseppe Balsamo and forced a retraction and apology from his detractors. In 1789 Cagliostro left England to visit Rome, where he was arrested by the Inquisition on the charge of being a Mason. Imprisoned and tortured, he was sentenced to death, changed in life imprisonment by the Pope. Cagliostro died in a dungeon in 1795.;x

The crisis of the medieval Jubilee began in 1525 after the Theses of Martin Luther and the Protestant Reformation, when doubts rose about the opportunity whether or not to celebrate the Holy Year. In facts the Lutherans spread out several booklets in which they openly accused Pope Clemens VII to proclaim the Jubilee with the purpose to increase the Church's treasury only. However in April 1524 Clemens VII decided to promulgate the Jubilee with the papal bull 'Inter sollicitudes et coram nobis'. That papal bull exempted only the pilgrims in Rome from charity while anyone else, who couldn't reach the Eternal City, was still obliged to get indulgencies. For the first time the Holy Door of St Peter's was opened with a golden hammer. The Holy Year wasn't much participated due to the current Italian wars, to the fear for the advancing Turk and to the peasant's revolts in Germany. And more, in august 1525 there was a new outbreak of the plague while in May 1527, two years after that Jubilee, Rome was terribly 'sacked' by the imperial Lansquenets.;x

In 1518 the ship he was on was captured by Pedro Bodiviglia, a Knight of Saint John, and Hasan was taken to Rome as a prisoner. Pope Leo X was fascinated with the learned Muslim and freed him, after which Hasan converted to Christianity and took the name Giovanni Leone, or Leo Africanus (Leo the African). The Pope even gave him a good income just to study Italian so he could write down his exploits in a book. Leo took him up on the offer, writing History and Description of Africa and the Notable Things Contained Therein, published in 1526.

EVENTHIST251028;In 1501, Cardinal Oliviero Carafa decided to make Parione district the social center of Rome. He took over Palazzo Orsini and ordered Donato Bramante to restore the palace. During this work, a marble statue was discovered in the foundation. The unidentified statue had neither legs nor arms, the face was without a nose and the eyes were ghost-like. Nevertheless, the Cardinal found it appealing and put it on a marble pedestal in a small square. Each April 25, Cardinal Oliviero chaired a Latin literary competition in which sonnets were posted on the statue. The residents carried on with the practice of adapting literary poems into satire, a pasquinade, exhibited in a public place. That's how Pasquino became the first talking statue of Rome. He spoke out about people's dissatisfaction, he denounced injustice, and he assaulted the nepotistic system and the misgovernment of the Church. Severe laws however were issued to stop the practice and Pasquino was put under surveillance. This led to the undesired result of multiplying the talking statues of Rome. So the so-called Congress of the Witty was formed, with Pasquino always the leader, and Marforio, Abate Luigi, Madama Lucrezia, Facchino and Babbuino as his cohorts. The most famous pasquinade was against Pope Urbanus VIII Barberini by 'saying' -What the Barbarians did not do the Barberini did- after he used the bronze tiles of the Pantheon for the Bernini's Canopy in St Peter's Dome in 1624.;x

EVENTNAME251029;The reforms of Sixtus V;x
EVENTHIST251029;Sixtus V was a born ruler and especially suited to stem the tide of disorder and lawlessness which had broken out towards the end of the reign of Gregory XIII. Having obtained the co-operation of the neighbouring states, he exterminated, often with excessive cruelty, the system of brigandage which had reached immense proportions and terrorized the whole of Italy. The number of bandits in and about Rome at the death of Gregory XIII has been variously estimated at from twelve to twenty-seven thousand, and in little more than two years after the accession of Sixtus V the Papal States had become the most secure country in Europe. Of almost equal importance with the extermination of the bandits was, in the opinion of Sixtus V, the rearrangement of the papal finances. At his accession the papal exchequer was empty. Acting on his favourite principle that riches as well as severity are necessary for good government, he used every available means to replenish the state treasury. By the sale of offices, the establishment of new 'Monti' and by levying new taxes, he accumulated a vast surplus, which he stored up against certain specified emergencies, such as a crusade or the defence of the Holy See. He prided himself upon his hoard, but the method by which it had been amassed was financially unsound: some of the taxes proved ruinous, and the withdrawal of so much money from circulation could not fail to cause distress. He did not consider that in the long run so much dead capital withdrawn from circulation was certain to impoverish the country and deal the death-blow to commerce and industry. Though extremely economical in other ways, Sixtus V spent immense sums of money in erection of public works in Rome like rebuilding countless churches, beautifying streets and erecting new buildings and monuments. Far-reaching were the reforms which Sixtus V introduced in the management of ecclesiastical affairs. He limited the College of Cardinals to seventy and established fifteen permanent cardinalitial congregations, some of which were concerned with spiritual, others with temporal affairs. Although these congregations lessened the work of the Pope, they didn't limit in any way his authority, because the final decision always belonged to the Pope.;x

EVENTNAME251032;The cancellation of the Holy Year;x
EVENTHIST251032;In 1800 the 20th Jubilee was to be celebrated, but the difficult political situation of the Church during the French Revolutionary Wars prevented Pius VII from proclaiming it. Unfortunately Napoléon was intentioned to vassalize the Pope and to force him to accept French cardinals, but when the Pope clearly refused to submit to his will he was imprisoned and transferred to France. In 1798 from his 'captivity' in France, while the Repubblica Romana was ruling in the Papal States, Pius VI ordered some cardinals to proceed in any case with the traditional papal election once he had died. So, on 14 March 1800, soon after Pius VI's death, a new Pope, Pius VII, was elected in St. George's monastery in Venice. Since it was too late to proclaim a Jubilee for that current year, on 24 May 1800 Pope Pius VII issued a papal bull 'Quod hoc inquente', with which he conceded the jubilary indulgence to anyone who, in the following 15 days, would have gone to confessions, received communions and visited churches, and not necessarily in Rome. The year 1800 was the only one hundredth year and the only one year to begin a century since 1300 in which the Holy Year couldn't be celebrated. Also, 1800 it isn't numbered as the 20th amongst the ordinary Holy Years. The 20th Holy Year was proclaimed on 24 may 1824 and celebrated in 1825 by Pope Leo XII after 50 years from the previous one. In that Jubilee St Mary of Trastevere took the place of the St Paul's Basilica as pilgrimage site since the latter was being rebuilt after a fire. The Jubilee saw the participation of 375000 pilgrims.;x

EVENTNAME251033;Crisis in Rome;x
EVENTHIST251033;The Council held in Constance from 1414 to 1418 brought an end to the Great Schism, declared its superiority over the Papacy, deposed two of the claimant popes (Gregorius XII elected in Rome and supported by Bayern, Naples, Hungary and Venice and Benedictus XIII elected in Avignon and supported by Castile, Aragon and Scotland) and pressed to abdicate the third (Johannes XXIII elected in the council of Pisa) and eventually chose a new pontiff, Martinus V. The new elected Pope left Constance at the close of the Council in May 1418 and travelled slowly through Italy, lingered at Florence and did not venture to enter Rome until September 1420. In fact, anarchy reigned in the Church held territories as no real government was ever established in there since 1309 when the Pope was first 'taken captive' in Avignon. Ladislao of Anjou-Durazzo, former King of Naples and vassal to the Pope, had occupied Rome and the whole Patrimonium Petri, whilst Braccio da Montone, former commander of Papal troops, was destabilizing the State of the Church from inside by looting villages and trying to establish his own Signoria in Umbria. Turmoil was everywhere...;x

EVENTNAME251034;Anarchy in the Legations;x
EVENTHIST251034;Entering his dominions, the Pope's first task was to restore the State of the Church to the prosperity and order to which it had become a stranger. In doing this he tried to gain external political support which he eventually obtained from Giovanna II of the House of Anjou-Durazzo and Queen of Naples, also known as Giovannetta or the 'Queen-Bee' for her dissolute life. In exchange for the repossession of the Papal territories, which her brother Ladislao formerly occupied when Rome had no ruler, Giovanna was legitimately enthroned Queen of Naples by the Pope in a solemn ceremony held in the city of Naples on 28 October 1419. But the Pope desperately needed troops to bring back the order over the territories of the Papal Legations in Umbria, Marche and Romagna, where the populations rebelled thanks to the abuses perpetrated by Braccio da Montone's mercenaries, and asked Giovanna II for help.;x

EVENTNAME251044;The Fall of il Valentino;x
EVENTHIST251044;As soon as Louis XII conquered Milan, he respected the pacts with Alexander VI and helped Cesare Borgia to carve himself a principality in Romagna and Marche. In November 1499 Cesare Borgia, also known as 'il Valentino' because of his ducal title, started his adventure in Romagna and Marche, territories belonging to the Papal States only nominally where the fiefs of Rimini, Pesaro, Imola, Faenza, Forli, Urbino and Camerino were declared forfeited with Papal bulls for the reason that they didn't pay the census to the Church. Imola and Faenza were his first conquests then he took Cesena but he had to suspend the military operations because of il Moro's restauration in Milan. He used the ceasefire to pay a visit in Rome for the Holy Year and to be appointed Gonfaloniere of the Church by his father. By the end of the year, Borgia resumed his military campaign and the following year, with the conquests of Pesaro, Rimini and Faenza, took control of Romagna, for which he obtained the ducal investiture by Pope Alexander VI. Cesare Borgia's greed wasn't yet satisfied, he also wanted to submit the cities of Bologna and Firenze, but since those cities asked Louis XII's military protection, he diverted to Marche principalities where he managed to easily submit the duchies of Urbino and Camerino. But in August 1503, both Cesare and Alexander fell very ill simultaneously, wether from an epidemy or poison it is unclear. Alexander died, and two days later the Orsini family rose against Cesare in Rome. Venice saw the opportunity to send troops to reinstate the petty tyrants in Romagna under condition that they should accept her suzerainity. They took direct control of Faenza, since the Manfredi were extinct, and of Rimini, which Malatesta surrendered to Venice. When Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere, a sworn enemy of the Borgias, was elected Pope with the name of Julius II, with the Venetian cardinals's support because he was favorable in principle to the Venetian interests, he saw that what Cesare Borgia had been doing was what was needed to bring the Papal States under effective control. But despite the arrangement with Cesare that gained his support in the Papal election, il Valentino was an obstacle, so breaking his word, Julius II got rid of him having the King of Aragon order his imprisonment in Spain. Cesare would escape two years later only to die helping his brother-in-law the King of Navarre quell a rebellion in 1507.;x

The offended nephews induced their uncle to ban Parmesan grain shipments into Rome, depriving the Duke of funds needed to repay his Roman creditors. When these creditors also appealed to Urban for help, the Pope had found a pretext (like Papal seizure of Ferrera 1598 and Urbino 1631) to occupy Odoardo's Duchy of Castro.

EVENTHIST251053;Michelangelo Merisi, one of the most extraordinary painters in the history of art, was born in 1571 not far from the village of Caravaggio (near Milan) where his family came from and after which he named himself. In 1592, he moved to the 'Rome of the Popes' with the prospect of large and lucrative commissions. Once there his painting skills attracted the attention of patrons who gave him also food and lodgings. In the beginning, all of Caravaggio's early paintings were relatively small works, still-lifes, genre-scenes and a few occasional religious subjects: it was said he had used a prostitute as the model for some of his depictions of the Virgin Mary. The big chance came in 1597 with the commission of two large paintings for the Contarelli Chapel in San Luigi dei Francesi about St Matthew's life. This commission made him famous as much as his life-style and violent behaviour made him notorious everywhere. His name appeared regularly in the protocols of the Roman police, however he received support and protection by some of the most sophisticated patrons in Rome. But in 1606 his violent temper didn't save him from murdering a person with whom he, unwilling to pay a bet on a real tennis match, got involved in a fierce fight. In hiding himself Caravaggio left Rome and went to Naples where, waiting for the Papal pardon which would allow him to return, he did some paintings. With no answer from Rome, Caravaggio left Naples and in the following year arrived on the island of Malta. In his stay on the island he painted his masterpiece 'the Beheading of St John', for which he was made Knight of the Order of Obedience. Soon his 'tormented nature' led him to quarrel with a noble knight and subsequently to escape from the island. Back to Rome he was imprisoned because of his former killing, however he managed to escape and flee to Sicily and then to Naples where he was badly wounded by two hired killers. In 1610 he decided to leave Naples and set sail to Porto Ercole in the Spanish held State of Presidi, at only 80 km far from Rome waiting for the Papal pardon. But there he was mistakenly captured by the local police and imprisoned for some days. After his release, discovering that his boat had sailed away with all of his poor belongings still on board, he was seen running insanely along the shore until he fell unconscious, caught by a raging fever which brought him to death a few days after. He was only 38 years old...;x

EVENTNAME251054;Excommunication of Jiriz Podiebrad;x
EVENTHIST251054;The more moderate wing of the heretic Hussites of Bohemia had been granted limited religious freedom in 1436 by the Compactates and since then practiced its faith openly in Bohemia, tolerated by the Catholic church. When Pius II rose to the Holy See, he was determined to end this situation. He got George of Podiebrad who was a Hussite himself to promise converting to Catholicism and suppressing all heresy in Bohemia just before his election in 1458. Podiebrad however, while indeed planning to return to the Roman Church himself, had no intention to persecute his former coreligionists and insisted on the Compactates. As a reaction, on March 31st 1462 Pius declared that the Compactates had been valid only for the generation that lived back then and were now invalid and demanded Bohemia's full return to Catholicism. At an assembly of the estates in Prague, George refused and said he would to his death remain true to the communion of both kinds, and that he was ready to risk his life and his crown in defense of his faith. Pius then quickly terminated negotiations with Bohemia and declared George a heretic in 1464. Encouraged by the church, the Catholic nobles of Bohemia began a revolt against Podiebrad in 1465. The King of Bohemia was officially excommunicated and his subjects released from their oaths on December 23rd 1466. Afterwards, the - theoretically now vacant - Bohemian throne was offered first to Friedrich of Brandenburg and, when he refused, to Matthias Corvinus of Hungary. The King of Hungary accepted and began a campaign against Bohemia.;x

EVENTNAME251056;Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina;x
EVENTHIST251056;Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina was appointed 'maestro di cappella' of the Cappella Giulia in Rome in 1551, where he issued his first works. Palestrina's fame and influence rapidly increased through the wide diffusion of his published works. So great was his reputation that in 1577 he was asked to rewrite the church's main plainchant books, following the Council of Trent's guidelines. His most famous mass, 'Missa Papae Marcelli', may have been composed to satisty the council's requirements for musical cogency and textual intelligibility. Palestrina ranks as one of the greatest Renaissance masters. In his sacred music he assimilated and refined his predecessors' polyphonic techniques to produce a 'seamless' texture, with all voices perfectly balanced. The nobility and restraint of his most expressive works established the almost legendary reverence that has long surrounded his name.;x

'Giovanni Della Casa, Treatise on Good Manners, 1551'. That treatise called il Galateo and named after Galeazzo (in latin Galatheus) Florimonte, a bishop who requested this composition, is a prime written example of how good manners are to be taught. Della Casa presented himself as a wise, older man seeking to smooth the social path of the young nobleman through the use of proper etiquette, tempering his actions and demeanor to suit those with whom he is keeping company, to act in moderation, and to do 'dirty, foul, repulsive, or disgusting things' only outside the company of others and giving importance of dressing in harmony with one's social rank and dressing in accordance of the norms of one's community.

A strong enmity ensued between French people in Rome and Corsican Guards, culminating on 20th August 1662 when a violent brawl between Corsicans and soldiers of the French ambassador, the Duke of Créquy, took place in a tavern. In the evening, the Duke's palace was assaulted and the ambassadress's carriage was even shot at. Six men died, including a civilian who happened to belong to the Duke's household. Louis XIV reacted immediately by sending back the Nuncio from Paris, invaded the Comtat- Venaissin and asked for the Corsican Guard to be entirely disbanded and for the Corsicans to be declared unfit to serve the Papal States.

EVENTHIST251066;In the late XVIIth century, the disuse of the Mediterranean sea as the main international trade junction between Europa and the East Indies brought the Italian economic system to collapse. Italy became more removed from the mainstream of European development and each local administration along the peninsula lagged behind that of any other European contemporary. The practice of agriculture as prevailing economic activity meant the coming back to power of the most conservative landowning aristocracy. That economic backwardness associated with the effects of Counterreform deeply affected Italian social life too, now less and less inclined to accept innovation and to develop some entrepreneurial attitude.;x

Other disputes where against the Este family in failing to provide the annual tribute for usage of Papal lands in the Romagna. To gain these lands from the Este family for his own family, Sixtus IV committed himself rather scandalously to Venice's aim in destroying the Kingdom of Ferrara, which he incited the Venetians to attack in 1482. Venice refusing to desist from the hostilities that Sixtus had instigated and for appearing to be a dangerous rival to the Papal States after taking all of the polesine, was placed under interdict in 1483.;x

Although both Muzio Attendolo Sforza and Braccio da Montone came from the Alberico da Barbiano's Compagnia di Ventura di San Giorgio, they had different approaches to strategic-tactical warfare, the 'Scuola Sforzesca' based mainly upon coordinated field manoeuvres and planned tactics and the 'Scuola Braccesca' based mainly upon energic assaults and the element of surprise. In their first battle against each other Fortebraccio (da Montone's nickname) prevailed. Informed of M. Attendolo Sforza's defeat, the Queen welcomed Pope's request of more troops in order to stop da Montone. However Martinus V managed to come to terms with da Montone promising him a title in exchange for his military services in retaking the Church territories.

In spite of her refusal and thanks to the mediation of Florence, Martinus V managed however to come to terms with da Montone promising him a title in exchange for his military services. Finally the Papal troops commanded by Braccio da Montone himself succeeded in retaking the Church territories. As soon as the order in his States was re-established and in order to punish Giovanna for her unexpected refusal to send troops, the Pope offered the crown of Naples to the junior House of the Angevins, always interested in the succession to the throne of Naples, proclaiming Louis III d'Anjou 'King of Naples' on 4 December 1419.;x

EVENTNAME3467;The Nieszawa Privileges-'Conventiones Particulares';x
EVENTHIST3467;After the concessions to the Nobility given by Wladyslaw Jagiello in 1425 and during the Thirteen Years War King Kazimierz was forced to new concessions. To be able to raise troops, among them a lot of mercenaries, the King needed money from the Szlachta. In an effort to solve the monarchy's pressing problems he had to accept the Nieszawa Privileges implying that the Nobility had the right to hold local Conventiones Particulares, without which no troops could be raised and no taxes extracted. In this way the Nobility got an efficient and powerful organization with a joint mutual interest, and power of the military and the taxation legislative procedure.;x

EVENTHIST3476;In 1569 discussions had been held and it was evident that many magnates wanted the joint force of Lithuanian and Polish Magnates as well as the Sejms of these countries to met at Lublin on the border of their realms and unanimously swear a new Act of Union. There now existed one united Sejm convening in Warszawa and the country would have one King not only de facto but de jure. The Grand Duchy was to keep its old laws, a separate treasury and its own army under its own Grand Hetman and Field-Hetman. Effectively the Union would be a marriage of two partners, with only the slightest hint of the dominant position of Poland. However there was some Lithuanian opposition before 1st July...Mikolaj the Black, the head of the mighty Radziwill family had long dreamed to of detaching the Grand Duchy from the domination and recreate a Lithuania with him as King. The first steps were taken in the 1540's when Mikolaj approached the Habsburg Emperor who was very interested in seeing a weakened Poland on her borders. This lead to Mikolaj receiving the title Prince of the Holy Roman Empire in 1547. In April 1569 Mikolaj had bribed and prodded his fellow magnates into following his plan. The lower Lithuanian Szlachta was considered immature and voted as their magnates did. So on 1st July the meeting took place in Lublin, but the Lithuanian Szlachta unanimously detested any attempt to create a Union. At the same time Mikolaj let himself be crowned King of Lithuania in Vilna and announced that if Poland did not accept that Lithuania went her own way then Lithuania would realize a Military Alliance with the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire.;x

EVENTHIST3477;Zygmunt III was the son of the King Johan III of Sweden. His father was a man that ruled a staunch protestant country, but with a personal leaning toward Catholicism. Zygmunt was brought up by Jesuits and preferred their company. Religion was as important to him as politics and one of his great obsessions was to make Catholicism the State-religion of Poland. This was perhaps the most impossible task a man, even if King, to accomplish in Poland. The Freedom of religion and the ideological principle of religious tolerance was the fundament of Polish society. Zygmunt though strong willed and stubborn tried. He of course had the whole country against him and failed. These acts also made him many enemies, which would stop him from reforming the government and strengthen Royal power in the first decade of the 17th century.;x

EVENTHIST3478;The Time of Troubles in Russia was a great triangular drama, between Poles and Swedes and of course, Russians in the Middle. Poland had since the outbreak supported the different False Dimitrijs, but in 1609 a Russian Boyar embassy arrived in Warszawa and proposed to make Zygmunt III's eldest son, Wladyslav, the new Tsar of Russia. This was a great and interesting opportunity and with a completely different father, Wladyslaw might have brought the Wasa Dynasty on the Russian throne. However, one of the prerequisites was that Wladyslaw converted to the Orthodox Faith something that was completely unthinkable for his father, the Jesuit-King. Instead the refusal made that faction of Boyars rally around a new candidate and Zygmunt had to declare war on Russia to be able to meddle in that muddy pound.;x

On his election he was forced to sign what have later been called the Henrykian Articles, which rectified that Poland was an elective monarchy from onwards. He also signed the Pacta Conventa, which was a formal contract between the elected monarch and the Sejm. In practice the monarch lost all power over his country. He had no power over governmental officials and he had a mere 3000 men strong Royal Army. To get anything extra he had to beg the Sejm to authorize. At this moment Poland effectively stopped being a monarchy, as the monarch was a mere figure head, and instead a true Aristocracy.;x

EVENTNAME3481;The Struggle for Royal Power;x
EVENTHIST3481;In the early 17th century Poland was one of the mightiest countries in the world, yet she had great problems. The trade and technical production of Eastern Europe was based along the Baltic Coast. There lay the future of the next major power in the area. The King saw this and tried to improve Polish position in these areas, but the Szlachta was not remotely interested. Her interests lay in the Ukraine and the Wild lands where the Magnates could rule armies of serfs on the vast agricultural production plants. This was the first disagreement between King Zygmunt III and the Nobility. Another one was the matter of the religious freedom. The King never stopped working for making the Catholic Faith the foremost religion in the country. However he was quite unsuccessful. The last disagreement was the about Royal power. Zygmunt was the grandson of the strong Swedish King Gustavus Wasa and he worked for absolutism. Zygmunt fought an uneven fight, but his struggle irritated the Poles so much that his reputation is tarnished to this very day. He also managed to upset people with his undiplomatic efforts to increase his power and because of that the Zebrzydowski rebellion stopped his effort for good.;x

It was on one hand a guarantee that decisions where decided unanimously and on the other hand a safeguard for the personal freedom of the individual nobleman. However for Poland as a country it was disastrous and one among a half dozen reason for the demise of the country in 1795. One single NO vote in the Sejm could dissolve the Sejm and paralyze decision-making in the country. It was also used frequently in the lesser Sejms, the sejmiki, of which there were over 70 in Poland.

The fall of the key border fortress Kamieniec Podolski was followed by the humiliating Peace of Buczacz.

EVENTHIST3491;In 1697, the 15 years old Charles XII ascended the Swedish throne. Seeing the opportunity, the Russian Czar Peter I allied with Denmark and Poland-Saxony in 1699. However, with British and Dutch naval assistance, Charles XII landed on Zealand and promptly defeated the Danes, then moved to Estland where his badly outnumbered Swedes (1 to 5) won a crushing victory over the Russians. Instead of finishing the Russians, Charles moved against August II of Poland-Saxony and drove him out of Poland in 1704 (having the pro-Swedish Stanislas Leszinski elected King), then subjugating Saxony in 1706. While the Russians started the construction of St-Petersburg (1703) and rebuilt their armies, they also took parts of Estland (1704-1706). Charles then decided to march to Moscow via the Ukraine where the Cossacks under Mazeppa had again risen in revolt (1708). The harsh winter and Russian raids decimated his army and he was finally beaten at the battle of Poltava in 1709. The wounded King escaped to the Ottomans. The Russians were encircled by the Ottomans on the Prut River, but Peter succeeded through bribery to obtain a safe conduct in exchange for Azov. While Charles was still exiled in Turkey, Russian, Danish, Hanoverian and even Prussian troops captured most of the Swedish territory around the Baltic. Having emerged from Turkish internment, Charles got killed in 1718 in front of the Norwegian fortress of Frederickshald. The peace treaties that followed Sweden lost most of her Baltic empire.;x

Stanislaw was a man of the enlightenment and early became interested in politics and diplomacy touring London, Amsterdam, Vienna, Paris and last St: Petersburg. There he was readily introduced to Tsaritsa Catherine the Great and became her lover. In 1764 when Poland needed a King, Catherine suggested her now ex-lover Stanislaw Poniatowski. That was a bad choice for Russia and a rather good one for Poland. Stanislaw knew the ways of Russian political mind and he was not subservient to the wishes of Moscow. However, the degeneration of Poland had gone so far that immediate reforms where necessary to stay independent, but on the other hand such reform most likely would draw attention in Moscow, Vienna and Berlin and it did. That reforms had just left the Sejm when the enemy armies started to march. The Fear of a Resurrected Poland had brought her neighbors to action.;x

At the same time, Russia was pushing for her own candidate, the Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, son-in-law of the Czarina Catherine I. After much bribing, negotiation and behind the scene diplomacy, Maurice was summoned to either leave or suffer war. It started in 1727, with Russia firmly committed and sending 8,000 troops to conquer the Duchy within 8 days.

EVENTHIST3497;On 12 September 1683 an allied army under the leadership of King Jan Sobieski relieved Vienna from the besieging Ottomans. At that moment the King's name flew over Europe. In that very moment Jan Sobieski had such status and personal power coming from his very person that he could had ended the stagnation of Poland or at least he could have tried. Merely the different political climate during the earlier days of his reign is a proof of him being a very special monarch. He was never that limited by vetoes or articles as earlier monarchs, but in the end he chose a different path. He chose to continue the campaign against the Ottoman, a campaign he could not win decisively, while at the same time having to cope with growing dissent from magnates disliking this policy. When he stopped campaigning he suffered heavily from gallstones and he never managed to make the magnates forget that he was just one of them. He never managed to translate his popularity in the Szlachta, as whole, into concerted political action. If he instead had gone home after relieving Vienna and picked a fight with the magnates something completely different might have happened. Well who knows...?;x

EVENTNAME3498;Ending the Stagnation;x
EVENTHIST3498;In 1697 Friedrich Augustus II became King of Poland. His reputation was never good. He was a German and because of his inabilities to win a war he himself had started he is considered a rather bad Polish King. However, when Friedrich Augustus became King he had a plan. He was not a stupid man, and he intended to turn the Commonwealth into a centralized monarchical state. He was a child of the same ideas as his contemporaries in Berlin, Hannover and München, and he needed a war to accomplish it. Like Sobieski, he saw war as the surest way to gain prestige and a free hand to carry out his plan. Now Friedrich Augustus made certain mistakes. He and his allies underestimated the ease with which they would smash the eighteen year old monarch of Sweden and secondly Friedrich August was no Sobieskian General. The failure of the war and his lost prestige from being a lousy soldier and having been forced to a humiliating abdication omitted every chance to reform anything. Instead he ruined any chance for monarchism in Poland and his return was with the arrivals of Russian bayonets. However... had he won the war and Poland had been a winner while Russia had become rather mauled then his position would have been different. Instead of buying art for his castles in Dresden he might very well have used that prestige and military power with boldness and brute force to accomplish the impossible...;x

This elicited an immediate response from St Petersburg and Berlin, both of which threatened with war if it were not withdrawn and if the Confederated Sejm was not immediately dissolved. The King and his supporters had little to do but comply trapped in Warszawa as they were. But people started to wake up from their 'Saxon slumber' and the Confederates refused to comply. At the same time some magnates wanted to get rid of the upstart Stanislaw and united with Russian forces under the young general Suvorov they fought and destroyed the Confederated troops.;x

EVENTHIST3500;In 1787 King Stanislaw approached Catherine of Russia with a bargain. Poland will raise a substantial army and support Russia in her war with the Ottomans, and make flanking maneuvers against potential attacks from Prussia or Sweden. The move was smart as it would mean that the King would have an army that could defend the country from enemies abroad and within, but Catherine did not buy it. She preferred having Poland as a piece of no-mans-land in between her and the Holy Roman Empire. As this failed the King stood without a plan and a decent foreign policy. The next year members of the so-called 'Patriotic Party' took matters in their own hands in the Great Sejm. It voted an increase of the army and vested control over it in a Sejm Commission. It placed the conduct of foreign policy in the hands of another Sejm Commission. It also abolished the Permanent Council that had governed the country since 1772 and imposed tax on incomes from lands, 10 percent for the Szlachta and 20 percent for the Church. In 1791 the King arrived from his isolation since the failure with Catherine and together with Ignacy Potocki and Hugo Kollataj he drafted the New Constitution. This became the first written Constitution in Europe and a satisfactory compromise between the republicanism of Potocki, the radicalism of Kollataj and the monarchism of the King. Again Catherine the Great reacted and as circumstances went against Poland peace was signed between the Ottomans and Russia and 89000 seasoned veterans now stood against the 37000 staunchly heroic, but no less, newly recruited Poles. No one helped Poland and the outcome was devastating.;x

While he was in Italy, Copernicus visited Rome, and it seems to have been for friends there that in about 1513 he wrote a short account of what has since become known as the Copernican theory, namely that the Sun (not the Earth) is at rest in the centre of the Universe. A full account of the theory was apparently slow to take a satisfactory shape, and was not published until the very end of Copernicus's life, under the title 'On the revolutions of the heavenly spheres' (De revolutionibus orbium coelestium, 1543). Copernicus' cosmology was considered implausible by the vast majority of his contemporaries, and by most astronomers and natural philosophers before the middle of the 17th century.;x

Moreover, Jagiello was elected to the throne of Poland - he was a hereditary ruler only in Lithuania - and his son had no legal right to the crown of the father. In 1425, the nobility and clergy of Poland guaranteed the rights of the child, but complications in Lithuania gave them a chance to strengthen their position. One of the main factors of Jagiello's agreement was that he believed that Lithuania could only be saved if it was in close alliance with Poland. New privileges, granted in 1430 and 1433, lowered land taxes paid by nobility to a token level and gave it them the famous 'neminem captivabimus' law - that no noble could be imprisoned without the verdict of a judiciary court.;x

EVENTHIST20126;Medieval Pomerania was almost never under strict Polish control, mainly due to a natural border composed of forests and swamps that divided it from Great Poland. It is thus unsurprising that it was the first Polish province to switch to the Holy Roman Empire. In 1181, Boguslaw I was vassalized by Frederick Barbarossa. It was not only a medieval law - Boguslaw was given a title of Prince of the Holy Roman Empire, and Pomerania became part of the Empire. There was no significant German immigration here for a long time, probably due to rivalry with Silesia, which was more developed and fertile. Overall, there wasn't a significant number of Poles, but the eastern parts (Lembork and Bytow) remained mostly Polish, and are a good example of what might have been had the province been recovered by Poland.;x

EVENTNAME20127;Polish dominance in Silesia;x
EVENTHIST20127;Medieval Silesia was composed of many small principalities. Most of them were vassalized by Jan of Luxembourg in 1329, but some parts remained under the control of Poland. The Jagiellonians were not as interested as the Piasts in this province, so Poland slowly gave up its rights. Germans were settling in the west Silesia since the first part of the 13th century and eventually west and central Silesia had been Germanized, including remnants of the Piast dynasty. Upper Silesia remained mostly Polish, providing a good example of what might have happened had the whole province been recovered.;x

EVENTNAME20128;Polish Dominance in Küstrin;x
EVENTHIST20128;The area of Küstrin had been settled by western Slavs since the early medieval era. In the 13th century it passed into the political sphere of Holy Roman Empire. The first act of German colonization was issued in 1175 by Boleslaw I the Tall, Polish prince of Silesia (Küstrin was part of Silesia, not Great Poland), but a significant influx of new settlers didn't start until about 50 years later. Due to this colonization and fact that Poland lost interest in its former western parts of the realm while moving towards the east, Küstrin had been Germanized. Had Poland regained that province, it may well have remained Polish.;x

EVENTNAME20129;Recovery of Pomerania;x
EVENTHIST20129;Pomerania was considered a part of Corona Regni Poloniae, but accepting this princedom in the Holy Roman Empire weakened Polands rights. During the 14th and 15th centuries, Pomerania was still contested land, but unlike Silesia, which had to be conquered, Polish Kings wanted to annex Pomerania diplomatically.

While Sigismund was intrigued with the idea of releasing the pretender, he was well aware of nobility's concern with sponsoring such an enterprise directly, as they were scared of possible alliance between Sweden and Russia which would've likely materialized had Poland openly supported the cause of the pretender.

However, they failed to get the approval of the Polish Sejm. Svitrigaila was a proponent of independent Lithuanian Kingdom, just like Vytautas was, and enjoyed the support of mainly Ruthenian/Russian nobles. He tried to convince Jagiello again to agree to be crowned as the King of Lithuania, but the Sejm kept an eye on Jagiello, and didn't let him meet with Svitrigaila.

The Grand Duchy of Lithuania was to keep its old laws, a separate treasury and its own army under its own Grand Hetman and Field-Hetman.

After education he joined Polish army as a professional soldier and earned fame of an excellent engineer. In 1644 he moved to Netherlands to continue his studies and served in the army of duke of Orange. In 1646 King Wladyslaw recalled him to Poland and appointed as a high-rank officer in Royal Artillery Corps where he spent three years reforming Polish artillery and fortifications. Siemionowicz's main work was Artis Magnae Artilleriae, (The Complete Art of Artillery), which became main artillery manual throughout Europe for two centuries. In his book Siemionowicz revealed his revolutionary ideas on metallurgy, ballistics, gunpowder, fireballs and various pyrotechnic devices. Book contains also a chapter on rockets designed for both civil and military purposes including multistage rockets, rocket batteries and rockets with delta wing stabilizers. This makes Siemionowicz one of European pioneers of rocketry.;x

EVENTNAME258007;Johannes Hevelius;x
EVENTHIST258007;Johannes Hevelius (Polish: Jan Heweliusz) was born in 1611 to a Gdansk family of prominent brewing merchants of Czech origin. During his youth he studied abroad in Germany, England and France. After returning to his home city in 1634, he became a prominent figure in Gdansk as a magistrate and a successful businessman. However, his main interest was astronomy. Hevelius spent four years observing the Moon and created detailed maps of the lunar surface. He also discovered the Moon's libration in magnitude. Careful observations allowed Hevelius to discover many stars and seven new constellations. Among the latter is the Shield of Sobieski - Scutum Sobiescanum, known as Scutum, the only constellation named after a historical figure. Hevelius was also interested in comets and discovered four new comets in the years 1652, 1661, 1672 and 1677. His discoveries led him to assume that these objects circulate the Sun in parabolic tracks. Johannes Hevelius died in 1687. Among his students was a young Englishman named Edmund Halley.;x

EVENTNAME258008;Michael Sendivogius;x
EVENTHIST258008;Michal Sedziwoj, or Michael Sendivogius, was a Polish alchemist, philosopher, and medic and a pioneer of modern chemistry. Sendivogius was different from most of his colleagues since he never claimed that he possessed philosopher's stone or any other kind of supernatural power. He preferred empirical studies which led him to many discoveries. For example, Sendivogius assumed that air is not a single substance, and by heating saltpeter he isolated oxygen, which he called the Elixir of Life. Sendivogius's fame reached Emperor Rudolf II, who invited him to Prague and imprisoned him, believing that Sendivogius actually possessed the legendary philosopher's stone. This led to a major diplomatic crisis between Poland and Austria. The alchemist was eventually released on demand of the Polish King Zygmunt III.;x

EVENTNAME258009;Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski;x
EVENTHIST258009;Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski was one of brightest minds of the Renaissance era. This former advisor of the King Zygmunt August and Polish Catholic priest published in 1554 book entitled De Republica emendanta - On the Improvement of the State. This work was a manifesto calling for deep social and political changes in every Kingdom and especially Poland. Frycz called for equity of every citizen regardless of social class, wealth, religion or nationality and a division between the Church and the State. Frycz also proposed reform of penal and civil law, secularization of education and ban of feudal privilages. Frycz's work was soon put by the church on list of prohibited books. However, in his liberal homeland his book 'On the Improvement of the State' was popular and widely discussed. Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski was a man whose mind was far beyond his epoch. Most of his ideas were not realized before the French Revolution.;x

EVENTNAME258010;Sarmatism;x
EVENTHIST258010;At the beginning of the 17th century Poland saw a drastic turnover in its cultural life. Up to this date Poland's material culture was just like that on the West. But it changed. Polish nobiles started to believe in myth that they are descendants of an ancient nomadic people named Sarmatians. That gave name to this cultural movement - Sarmatism. Sarmatism was famous for its unique 'Polish' costumes (in fact it was a mixture of Hungarian and Turkish costumes), art, way of life and even way of speaking in intentionally incorrect Polish. Unfortunately, soon the main virtues of Sarmatism degenerated. Patriotism turned into xenophobia, hospitality into massive drunkenness, love of tradition into social and political conservatism, pride into ferocity. Sarmatism did not affect only the westernmost parts of the country. Elsewhere it went out of fashion in the second half of 18th century when Poland returned to the Western ways.;x

EVENTHIST258011;During the liberal reign of Zygmunt August a group of Polish politicians and writers, including Jan Kochanowski and Mikolaj Rej founded a 'Republic' in a village of Babin, near Lublin. Even name of this 'entity' was a sneer since 'Babin' literally means 'Women's'. This 'Republic' was a parody of Poland with its diet (Sejm), offices and institutional church. It's 'citizens' were spending time on mocking parliamentary speeches, political discussions and famous persons. In many times they were simply mocking themselves. 'Republic of Babin' lacked only King. When Zygmunt August pointed out this oversight, Babin's 'government' responded that they do not need any other beyond him. The 'Republic of Babin' survived decades and many generations of politicians took active part of it. Even today it is a beautiful example of freedoms and right of expression which existed in ancient Poland.;x

The Italian was warmly welcomed by the King and settled in Poland. It was his initiatives to build one of contemporary Europe's biggest observatories in Ujazdow castle (near Warsaw) and to construct an extremely complex hydraulic scale. He also proposed to replace all the countless European systems of length measures by one integral metric system. In February 1648 De Nuaire, secretary of Queen Ludwika Maria of Poland, wrote to the famous Parisian astronomer Marino Marsene that in Warsaw Buratini demonstrated 'a model of 4 or 5 foots in length, which with the help of flex placed under the tail, could rise to the air: the flex was moving a spring and a wheel placed inside. This model could rise a cat sitting in it.' Later De Nuaire wrote that the Italian constructed 'a flying ship', which could transport a man.

New mints were opened in Brest, Kounia (Kaunas), Vilna, Malbork and Ujazdow to provide the state with this inflated money, the mints in Krakow, Oliwa and Bydgoszcz were also used for these purposes.

EVENTHIST258022;Because of financial problems Poland was forced to find new sources of money to finance the army that was fighting its many foes Andrew Tynf, main commissary of the Polish mintssuggested a solution, namely minting the 'zloty'  a coin worth 30 groszes - with 60 percent less silver in it than in ordinary coins. The only compensation was the phrase engraved on the coins: Dat Pretium Servata Salus Potior Q3 Metallo Est ('The desire to save the Fatherland is larger than the price of metal').

EVENTHIST258023;Buratini executed his task soon, but the 'cheap money' gave quite unexpected result: almost all valuable silver coins in the country's economy were replaced with cheap solids and the treasury was soon empty again. On 23 February 1663 the Senatorial General commission decided to mint more cheap solids (on the sum of 5.250.000 zlotys) to cover the budget deficit. Soon more solids on the sum of 5.818.774 zlotys were ordered for minting in Oliwa and Danzig. The last task was executing by Andrew Georg Horn.

Carefully educated, he distinguished himself during the war with the Ottoman Empire in 1620-21. Then he traveled to the Western Europe where he met some of Europe's famous commanders, including Spinola. After ascending onto Polish throne, Vladislav conducted many far-reaching military reforms. He reequipped artillery and infantry, increasing their firepower and Westernizing their drill and logistics. His new Polish army soon proved it effectiveness. It completely defeated the Russians in an excellent campaign during the Smolensk War (1633-4), made the Turks abandon their invasion plans (1634) and forced the Swedes to sign new, favorable truce (1635). Vladislavian army reforms prolonged Polish military supremacy in Central and Eastern Europe for 20 additional years.;x

EVENTNAME258040;Economic treatise of the Nicolaus Copernicus;x
EVENTHIST258040;Mikolaj Kopernik (Nicolaus Copernicus) was not only astronomer but also mathematician, lawyer, economist and clergyman. In years 1519 -1525 Kopernik worked on the treatise on the minting of money (De ratione cudendae monetae) which was published in 1528. One of his thesis is currently known as Gresham's Law (When there is a legal tender currency, bad money drives good money out of circulation). His other thesis were that depreciation of currency leads to the decline of country, mints should not be treated by rulers as source of income and cheap money does not help poor but introduces dearness.;x

EVENTNAME258041;Bernard Wapowski, royal cartographer;x
EVENTHIST258041;Bernard Wapowski was historian and outstanding Polish cartographer. At the beginning of XVIth century cooperated with cartographer Marco Beneventano in redaction of the map of Central Europe. In 1515 returned to Poland and became King's secretary. His two first maps picturing Eastern Europe were published in 1526. It were probably the first maps correcting Ptolemy's errorneous location of the Black See. Wapowski created also map of Poland and Lithuania, which was widely used by later cartographers and had considerable military significance, e.g. during Livonian wars in second half of XVIth century.;x

EVENTHIST258042;Justus Ludwik Decjusz (Ludwig Jodok Dietz) was economist, writer, historian, diplomat and secretary of Polish King. Born in Alsace, came to Poland in 1508. In 1528 reformed Polish monetary system and introduced new currency 'zloty' (zloto in Polish means gold). Established new mints and supervised copper mining. Basing on his project monetary union between Poland and Prussia was signed in 1528. Royal envoy to European countries, personally knew Martin Luter and Desiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam.;x

EVENTNAME258043;Queen Bona Sforza;x
EVENTHIST258043;Bona Sforza married King Zygmunt I and was crowned as Queen of Poland and Grand Duchess of Lithuania on 18 april 1518. Almost from the beginning, using her influence on King and organizing her own political party Bona was expanding her power base. Grown up and educated in Italy, she believed that financial resorces are required to strenghten royal authority and realize political plans and most of her actions led to the increase of the royal income. From Pope Leon X she obtained right to nominate man into a number of lucrative church positions. Was modernizing royal estates, redeeming previously mortgaged estates and in years 1536-1546 took over lucrative custom agencies in Lithuania. At the same time she was fortifying Jagiellon's estates in the south-eastern Poland and supported aggresive policy against Tatars. Very active on the arena of international politics, pursuited decisively anti-Habsburg policy supporting John Zapolya in 1526, acted to decrease influence of Hohenzollerns in Prussia and Silesia. Bona was also corresponding with Roxelana, favorite wife of Ottoman Sultan Suleyman. In later years Bona with her people were actually ruling country. Lithuania won war against Muscovy recovering Homel and Poland defeated Moldavia. Strenghtening of royal power and rule of the elites was obviously not welcomed by nobles.;x

EVENTHIST258044;On 19 of April 1525 Prussian duke Albrecht kneeled before King Simgundus I and swore his vassalage to him. However, he was not the only person that bowed before the King on that day. A man named Michel Ezofowicz was promoted into the ranks of knighthood in exchange for his faithful services. The only thing that differed this act from thousands of others is that Ezofowicz was a Jew who even kept with the faith of his fathers. This was most likely the only case in European history when a Jew became a knight.;x

EVENTHIST258045;In 1593, war between the Ottoman Empire and the Habsburgs started. In 1594 a very strong Tatar raid, carried by about 20,000-30,000 men led by the Khan of Crimea, Gazi II Giray plundered Pokucie and moved to Hungary through mountain passes, in order to plunder Habsburg lands. Commonwealth troops gathered too late to intercept it. The Prince of Transylvania, Sigismund Báthory, nephew of former Polish King Stefan Batory, had strengthened Habsburg influence in Moldavia after setting Stefan Razvan on the Moldavian throne. In 1595 Zamoyski, persuaded by Moldavian refugees, decided to intervene. The Commonwealth forces under hetman Jan Zamoyski crossed the Dniestr, defeated local opposition and Ottoman reinforcements, and set Ieremia Movila on the Moldavian throne as a Commonwealth vassal. This was seen by many as very dangerous step because Ottomans were preparing to place their own candidate on Moldavian throne.;x

EVENTNAME258047;Chicken War;x
EVENTHIST258047;Chicken War is the name for a 1537 anti-King rebellion by the Polish nobility. The term was invented by the supporters of the King who claimed that the ''war's'' only effect was the near-extinction of the local chickens by the gathered nobles. The main cause of the rebellion was a set of reforms initiated by King Zygmunt I the Old, in order to strengthen the King's power. Zygmunts's policies ended with a major conflict. The nobility, gathered near Lwów in order to force the King to abandon his reforms. It soon transpired, however, that the leaders of the rebellion were divided and that achieving a compromise was almost impossible. The King rejected most of their demands, only agreeing to some minor ones. Too weak to continue the conflict, the szlachta returned to their homes, having achieved little.;x

EVENTNAME258048;Try to centralise Poland;x
EVENTHIST258048;It seems that we gathered around the court enough powerful people from aristocracy and Szlachta to try to introduce long postponed reforms which will centralize our country.

EVENTHIST258049;Our plans to centralize government of Poland failed. Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski the Field Crown Hetman and Great Crown Marshall who first fully supported our centralization plans and who was very close to the King and his beloved wife Ludwika Maria had changed his mind. He started to openly criticize centralization plans and it was mainly his responsibility that they were rejected during two Sejm gatherings which were broken by Lubomirski's supporters.

He immediately started to gather around him other members of aristocracy and Szlachta who also were against our centralization reforms. Lubomirski's military forces started to fight our troops and the domestic war started. Even some of people who remained on our side quietly agree with or even support Lubomirski and they don't really want to fight against him. It is of the highest importance that we defeat Lubomirski very fast so other rebels will not have enough time to join him and Lubomirski will not have enough time to promote his ideas.;x

EVENTHIST258053;After the ascending of Stanislaw Poniatowski on the Polish throne a feverish wave of reforms took place. In 1766 Chancellor Zamoyski laid before the Sejm his project for constitutional reform which included the abolition of the Liberum Veto. This elicited an immediate response from St Petersburg, which threatened with war if it were not withdrawn and if the Confederated Sejm was not immediately dissolved. The King and his supporters had little to do but comply trapped in Warszawa as they were. But people started to wake up from their 'Saxon slumber' and the Confederates refused to comply. At the same time some magnates wanted to get rid of the upstart Stanislaw and united with Russian forces under the young general Suvorov they fought and destroyed the Confederated troops.;x

The Polish nobility were scandalized by their Queen-Consort's active role in Polish affairs. Regardless she proved instrumental in governing the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth during the Deluge (1647-60). Ludwika-Maria also founded the first Polish newspaper 'Merkuriusz Polski' (1652) and a convent for the 'Order of the Visitation of Holy Mary' (1654).;x

EVENTNAME258058;The Deluge;x
EVENTHIST258058;The period 1648-1660 is colloquially called 'The Deluge' in historiography of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Bet by the devastating Khmelnitsky's uprising, invaded by simultaneously by the Crimean Tatars, Russians, Swedes, Brandenburgians and Siebenburgians, the country literally collapsed in 1655 and King Jan Kazimierz was forced to flee from his realm. However, in a surprising twist of fortune, the Commonwealth rose again like phoenix from ashes and managed to repel the invaders away from its borders. Yet, it never truly recovered. The demographic and economic results of 'The Deluge' were devastating. The country had lost one third of its population. What's more, the decade of wars completely ruined the Commonwealth and turned much of its population into poverty. The times of prosperity were finally gone.

EVENTHIST258103;Jiriz Podiebrad died in 1471, in the middle of his struggle with Mathias Corvinus of Hungary who headed a 'crusade' against Bohemia and claimed its throne. Since his supporters were in a precarious military situation, having lost all lands of the Bohemian crown to the King of Hungary, Podiebrad had shortly before his death, despite being father of several adult sons himself, asked prince Vladislav of Poland to succeed him in order to save Hussitism and Bohemian independence. Vladislav indeed succeeded him and initiated a half century of Jagiellon rule in Bohemia.;x
ACTIONNAME258103A;Accept the offer and make Vladislav King of Bohemia;x
#;x
EVENTNAME258104;Wladyslaw Jagiello, King of Hungary;x
EVENTHIST258104;Mathias Corvinus of Hungary died in 1490. It had been his explicit wish to let his illegitimate son Janos succeed him, however when Corvinus was dead, the young, inexperienced Janos was soon deprived of his rights and his property by the Hungarian magnates who were fed up with the strong central rule introduced by Mathias and desired a monarch 'whose beard they could hold in their fists'. Such a candidate was found in Vladislav Jagiello, King of Bohemia since 1471. Called 'King All Right' by his Bohemian subjects because of his weakness, irresoluteness and saying yes to everything, obviously completely incompetent for ruling a Kingdom and having already initiated a rapid decline of Bohemia, he was the easily controllable puppet King the magnates were looking for. Vladislav was elected King on July 5th 1490. Like Bohemia, Hungary came thus under Polish domination.;x

EVENTNAME258105;Treaty of Kierzmark;x
EVENTHIST258105;In 1423, Jagiello, King of Poland, met Sigismund of Luxemburg, King of Hungary, nominal King of Bohemia, and Emperor, in the city of Kierzmark. Sigismund needed this meeting much more than Jagiello. His position in Bohemia was weak and Polish help for Hussites could only make it weaker. He was afraid that eventually Jagiello would accept the crown of Bohemia for himself or one of his relatives - the Czechs had made several offers. Fortunately, the Teutonic Order lost a war against Poland and Lithuania in 1422. He used it as a pretext for diplomatic bargains. Jagiello, as a neophite, was more concerned about a crusade being declared on Poland if it did nothing about the Hussites than about possible danger from the Order. So Jagiello gave up Hussites and Sigismund gave up Knights. Neither kept their promises - soon Sigismund went back to his anti-Polish politics and Jagiello still did not officially support the Hussites. The only real effect of the meeting was to diminish the chance of war.;x

EVENTNAME258106;Edict of Wielun;x
EVENTHIST258106;The Hussites were receiving substantial help from Greater Poland. Many of them settled there for a while, using it as a base for further operations against Sigismund. They soon entered cordial connections to the high nobility of that province. That group of people was disappointed with the current political situation in Poland. In fact, they wanted to replace nobles from Lesser Poland, who dominated the country since the renewal of the Kingdom of Poland in the early 14th century. The nobility from Greater Poland had rebelled many times since then, but always unsuccessfully. The Hussites provided another chance for classic feudal rebellion by power-hungry nobles. Zbigniew Olesnicki, bishop of Krakow and devoted Catholic, made the best use of the dangerous situation, getting the support of the nobles of Lesser Poland and forcing Jagiello to issue an edict against heretics.;x

EVENTHIST258107;During the war against the Teutonic Order in 1422, nobility gathered in the camp near Czewinsk forced new privileges on Wladyslaw Jagiello. The nobility gained assurance that their estates would not be seized without a legal verdict of the court of justice. Furthermotr, Jagiello promised not to mint money without the consent of the high officers of the Kingdom and to keep the Statutes of Kazimierz the Great in the judiciary. Encouraged by this victory, the nobles pushed for further concessions in 1423 in Warka. This time, a regional judiciary had been well arranged, but the nobility won the right for forced ransom of the lands owned by rich peasants.;x

Inspired by Luther he also decides to secularize the land areas under his control, Prussia, into a protestant duchy.

EVENTNAME258570;Warsaw Confederation;x
EVENTHIST258570;Religious tolerance in Poland had had a long tradition and had been de facto policy in the reign of the recently deceased King Zygmunt II. Following the childless death of the last King of the Jagiellon dynasty, Polish and Lithuanian nobles (szlachta) gathered at Warsaw to prevent any separatists from acting and to maintain the existing legal order. For that it was necessary to make all citizens unconditionally abide by any decision taken by a body, and the confederation was an important proof that two states stand together. On 28th of January 1573 the nobles signed a document in which representatives of all the major religions pledged each other mutual support and tolerance. The confederation created a legal basis for a new political system and at the same time secured the unity of the state which had been inhabited for generations by communities from different ethnic backgrounds (Poles, Lithuanians, Ruthenian, Germans and Jews) and of different denominations (Catholic, Protestant, Orthodox, Jewish and even Moslem). This act is remarkable in that it was not imposed by a government or by consequences of war, but rather resulted from the good will of members of Polish-Lithuanian society. It was also influenced by the 1572 French St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre, which prompted the Polish-Lithuanian nobility to see that no monarch would ever be able to carry out such an act in Poland. The articles of the Warsaw Confederation were later incorporated into the Henrician Articles, and thus became constitutional provisions alongside the Pacta conventa also instituted in 1573.;x

However, after Dom Afonso had ascended the throne as was customary at the age of 14, scheming noblemen at the court managed to cast doubts in the young King's mind about the intentions of the duke. The Duke was sent away from the King, but later decided to return to his side and help him rule the country. The Duke, not wanting to leave anything to chance and in fear of his conspiring enemies at the court, made the bad decision to approach the King accompanied by a force of several dozen soldiers for his own protection. The conspirators however managed to convince the King that his old beloved friend was now trying to start a rebellion against him. The King thus sent out an army to engage the enemy before he arrived. There was no real battle, but the Duke of Coimbra was killed never the less.;x

However the first Grand Inquisitor, the Bishop of Ceuta, had no intentions of using his powers and the Inquisition remained inactive until 1539 when he was replaced by the King's brother, Henrique, the Archbishop of Évora. While much lesser known than its Spanish counterpart, the Portuguese Inquisition probably executed more people over its existence than the Spanish Inquisition. To a much greater extent in Portugal than in Spain the Inquisition was used as a tool by the aristocracy to oppress the Novos Cristãos (New Christians) who comprised much of the Portuguese middle and commercial classes. It wasn't abolished until 1821, although the Marquis of Pombal pulled its teeth in 1768 by abolishing the distinction between New and Old Christians.;x

EVENTHIST3274;In 1580, a regency council convened in Portugal to settle the succession. With the death of Sebastião I, Portugal was left with no clear heir. In 1580, several people had claims to the throne: Filipe II of Spain, son of D. Isabel (daugther of D. Manuel I) who had a large support of the nobles but lacked peasant support, D. Antonio, despised by the nobles because he was an illegitimate son of D. Luis (son of D. Manuel I) but had great support from the lower classes, and finally, D. Catarina, the Duchess of Bragança. She was the legitimate daughter of D. Duarte (son of D. Manuel I). Duchess Catarina Bragança had the best claim to the throne but the nobles were unwilling to overlook her gender. Dismissing her claims left the nobles to either appeal to a foreign power, the claims of Filipe II of Spain, or accept Dom Antonio, illegitimate son of D. Luis. Filipe II sent diplomats to Lisbon to convince the aristocracy that he was the ideal heir for Portugal. If the Kingdom entered into a personal union with Spain, Filipe II would allow Portugal to keep its own laws and Cortes. Such a union would also be highly profitable at a time when the Portuguese economy was failing as no longer would the Spanish Kingdom fight against its trading interests.

Consequently the reforms he had started that had gotten Portugal back on the path to prosperity where not to continue.

Prince Henry made his base for sea exploration, making it a centre for cartography, navigation and shipbuilding. The Catalan Jew from Majorca, Jehuda Cresques, son of the cartographer Abraham Cresques, was brought to Sagres to supervise the collation of geographic facts brought back by Henry's explorers, who were encouraged and later required to keep detailed logs of their voyages. Muslims and Arabs, Italians from Genoa and Venice, Germans and Scandinavians came to Sagres. This community developed navigational instruments such as the quadrant, and new mathematical tables to aid in determining latitude.

It was also a popular belief that the sun was too hot to support life south of the cape. Many regarded it as the edge of the world. At the urging of Prince Henry, one of his captains, Gil Eannes, finally passed Cape Bojador in 1434. Further improvements in Caravel design also promoted the exploration of the African Coast. Henceforth, a series of expedtions in Portuguese caravels sailed south with the red Templar cross emblazoned upon their sails, bringing back ivory, gold, slaves, and other strange flora and fauna to Lisbon.;x

In 1437 Portugal sent an expedition against Tangier, led by Henry. The expedition failed, due largely to mistakes by Henry, and his youngest brother Fernão, the master of Avis, was captured. He was imprisoned in bad conditions, held hostage for the return of Ceuta to the Muslims. For eleven years the Portuguese debated whether or not to give up Ceuta, until in 1448 Dom Fernão died in captivity. Henry's brother Duarte died shortly after the Tangier expedition, leaving his six year old son Afonso as the King. There was a fight over the regency between Duarte's widow and Henry's brother D.

You should collect our ships after accomplishing all you are commanded to do at Quilon... and when these are collected, it would please us for you to pass to the mouth of the Red Sea.'' In furtherance of Manuel's instructions the Portuguese attempted to control all the shipping in the Indian Ocean by a system of cartazes (passes) that each shipowner was required to purchase to prevent his ship from being seized.

EVENTNAME260005;Treaty of Alcacovas;x
EVENTHIST260005;In 1469 Alfonso V of Portugal was presented with the opportunity of becoming the King of Castile when he and his brother-in-law Enrique IV of Castile agreed on his marriage to Isabel, Princess of Asturias (heir title). But the deal failed when Isabel married Fernando of Aragon. When Enrique died and Isabel proclaimed herself Queen, in 1475, he saw his chance disappearing and decided to play hard. In a month he was married to his niece, Juana, and had claimed the crown of Castile for himself, invading the country. The plan was good because Juana had also the support of France and a great part of the Castilian nobility who rebelled in her support. Despite the simultaneous invasion from France and Portugal, and the rebellion of the nobles in the West of Castile, the war did not go well. The French were stopped by the Basques, while Fernando, with troops mostly from Castile and Asturias, inflicted a crushing defeat to the Portuguese in Toro in 1476. Alfonso traveled to France to try to get a stronger involvement from Louis XI, but the French had lost interest. By then Fernando had recovered control of all the Northwest. The war at sea, that extended as far as the coast of Guinea, claimed by Castile, was also favorable to Isabel. Alfonso's marriage to his niece was not recognized by the Pope, and a last invasion at the South ended also in defeat at la Albuera in February, 1479. With the nobility subdued and the Portuguese defeated, Castile had now the upper hand, but Isabel was half Portuguese herself, and Portuguese was her first language. She desired a perpetual peace with Portugal, with long lasting friendship and perhaps a dynastic union in the future, like the one with Aragon, and she was prepared to be generous with the defeated to obtain it. The treaty of Alcacovas, was concluded in September 4, 1479. It had four parts, all of them historically important. In the first part, Isabel and Fernando were recognized as rightful Kings of Castile and Leon, and Alfonso was recognized as rightful King of Portugal. In the second part, Juana renounced to her claim to the crown of Castile and was forced to expend the rest of her life in a convent in Portugal. In the third part, the future marriage between the infant Alfonso, son of Joao and the infant Isabel, daughter of the Catholic Kings was arranged. And in the fourth part, Castile accepted the claim of Portugal over Guinea, and the Atlantic coast of Africa, Madeira, Azores and Cape Verde, and any future discoveries South of the Canary Islands toward Guinea. Portugal accepted the claim of Castile over the Canary Islands. The treaty of Alcacovas is very important because it created a long lasting peace between Portugal and Spain, and set the basis for future diplomatic resolution of conflicts, like the discovery of the New World and the treaty of Tordesillas. Some believe it was crucial to the discovery of the New World by Spain, as Africa was reserved for Portugal, leaving only the unknown West for Spain.;x

EVENTNAME260006;Camões, the Most Exalted Portuguese Poet;x
EVENTHIST260006;The most sublime figure in the history of Portuguese literature, celebrated worldwide, Camões owes his lasting fame to his epic poem Os Lusiadas, (The Lusiads). He is also remarkable for the degree of art attained in his lyrics, less noteworthy for his dramas. A wretched exile during a large part of his lifetime, he has enjoyed an abundance of fame since his death. His followers have been legion, and his memory has begot many fabulous legends. Born in 1524 or 1525, Camões came from a noble family of reduced means. He belonged to the same stock as the noted explorer, Vasco da Gama, who figures importantly in The Lusiads. His life was one of adventure with voyages to distant lands, impossible love affairs, shipwrecks, duels and combat. He was willing to spend more than he earned, which lead to his poverty in his old age. Nevertheless, he was able to publish his Magnum Opus (The Lusiads) in 1572 dedicating it to the visionary and foolhardy King Dom Sebastião. He died in 1580.;x

At the Treaty of San Ildefonso on October 1, 1777, confirmed in the Treaty of El Pardo in 1778, Portugal ceded Colônia del Sacramento to Spain, but retained Santa Catalina and San Pedro, adquiring rights beyond Tordesillas limits in exchange for the African island of Fernando Po (now Bioko) and full commercial rights in the African coast between the Niger and the Ogoue rivers.

The latter had been a pupil of the Rabbi Abraham ben Samuel Zacuto at the University of Salamanca and he provided the commission with a copy of the Rabbi's Almanach Perpetuum Colestium Motium (Perpetual Almanac of the Heavenly Bodies) which consisted of tables that listed the declination of the sun over the course of the year. The commission published the Regimento do Astrolabio e do Quadrante which contained a Portuguese translation of the 1250 text by Sacrobosco, Sphaera Mundi, on the spherical nature of the Earth. It also included the Regimento do Norte which gve rules on how to use the Pole Star to determine latitude and the Regimento do Sol which provided rules and tables to allow sailors to use the height of the sun at noon to determine their latitude. Coupled with improvements in navigational instruments this information greatly eased the navigational problems that had bedevilled earlier explorers.;x

EVENTHIST260022;In 1487 Joao II of Portugal ordered Bartolomeu Dias around Africa by sea, but he also ordered his trusted spymaster and diplomat, Pêro da Covilhã, to reach India and the Kingdom of Prester John by land. Pêro da Covilhã spoke fluent arabic, and with a companion travelled to Mecca. From there he travelled alone to Goa and Calicut, learning about currents, winds and the origen of the different spices. He then returned to Cairo. From there he forwarded his information together with advise on the best sea-route to India to his King, before continuing to Aden, Ormuz, and Saylac, in the coast of Adal. He finally arrived to Ethiopia in 1490, being well received by Emperor Eskander. After four years of stay, he was preparing his departure, with a proposal of an alliance from the Emperor of Ethiopia to the King of Portugal, when Eskander died. He was succeded by his brother Na'od, who forbade Pêro's departure. Around 1510, King Manuel received an ambassador from Ethiopia, an Armenian called Matthew. In the name of Empress Eleni, he proposed an alliance between Ethiopia and Portugal. It would be 10 years before Portuguese ambassadors went to Ethiopia with a positive answer. By then things had changed and the new Emperor showed no interest. However this time Emperor Dawit II, better known as Lebna Dengel, might be having problems with their Muslim neighbours, as he is requesting to enter vassalage to the King of Portugal.

EVENTHIST260023;The medieval legend of the Kingdom of Prester John, a mythical Kingdom that kept the Muslims at bay, was popular when Islam seemed unstoppable. According to legend, Prester John could help Europe fend off the Muslim assaults. Although the myth had no basis, it seemed to fit Ethiopia better than any other place. Except that when re-discovered by Europe, Ethiopia was backwards and beleaguered, more in need of help than capable of lending it. Around 1510, King Manuel received an ambassador from Ethiopia, an Armenian called Matthew. In the name of Empress Eleni, he proposed an alliance between Ethiopia and Portugal. It would be 10 years before Portuguese ambassadors went to Ethiopia with a positive answer. By then things had changed and the new Emperor showed no interest. However in 1535 facing a war of extermination by Adal, the same Ethiopian Emperor sent a plee to the Pope and the King of Portugal by way of Juan Bermudez, a Portuguese priest that had remained in Ethiopia. Bermudez claimed that the Emperor had promised to turn his country into Catholicism if help was forwarded, and requested to be named archbishop of the new Ethiopian Catholic Church. This has been a controversial issue since, but Bermudez's description of the horrors inflicted on the Christian Ethiopians, the destruction of their churches, and the killing of their priests and nuns, plus the desire to control the entrance to the Red Sea, moved King João III 'o Piedoso' (the Pius) to order the new Viceroy of India, Estevão da Gama, to send military aid to Ethiopia.

EVENTNAME260026;War of the Mascates;x
EVENTHIST260026;Sugar was already in decline when gold was discovered in Minas Gerais. The resulting flood of immigrants exacerbated tensions between the sugar-planters in Olinda, the provincial capital of Pernambuco and the merchants, many of them of them recent immigrants themselves, of the thriving port city of Recife. The latter, derisively termed 'mascates', or peddlars by the planters, resented the fact that they had no say in even their local government because Recife wasn't legally a separate city and fell under the control of Olinda. The proclamation of the royal decree granting municipal status to Recife by the governor, Sebastiao de Castro e Caldas, in February and March of 1710 was seen as a threat to the dominance of Olinda and its controlling oligarchy of sugar-planters. This was exacerbated by D. Joao V's failure to deliniate the boundaries of Recife, leaving it for the governor and the ouvidor (crown judge) to settle the boundaries between them. De Castro e Caldas awarded three parishes to Recife over the protests of the ouvidor and the town council and arrested the deputation that made the protests. This high-handed act triggered almost half a decade of unrest between partisans of each side, to include sporadic armed conflict between the garrison of Recife and the Olinda milita.;x

EVENTNAME260029;War of the Emboabas;x
EVENTHIST260029;The discovery of gold in Minas Gerais by men from São Paulo (Paulistas) resulted in a flood of immigrants. The Paulistas derisively termed the newcomers ''emboabas'' (birds with feathered legs) and regarded them with contempt since they were unfamiliar with life in the Brazilian hinterlands and were competitors for the gold that had been originally claimed by the Paulistas. The massive influx of people into an area that was essentially totally undeveloped before gold was discovered caused prices for the necessities of life to skyrocket, another bone of contention. Tensions were high between the two groups, but open conflict didn't break out until November of 1708 when the Paulista José Pardo was lynched. The emboabas attempted to disarm the Pauistas and evict them entirely from the gold regions. Their leader, Nunes Viana, even began to fill government post, pending the arrival of royal nominees. This alarmed the Governor of Rio de Janiero who arrived in Minas Gerais with a small escort of troops to investigate the disturbances. He generally supported the Paulistas as having legitimate grievances, but the emboabas forced him to return to Rio without settling the major issues. Lisbon ordered the new governor of Rio de Janiero, António de Albuquerque, to proclaim a general amnesty in the hopes of quelling the disturbances. This worked reasonably well, but Paulista hotheads gather forces for one last effort to retake the goldfields on 14 November 1709. They failed, not least to a warning of the impending attack by Albuquerque, and returned home to find a personal appeal by the King, D. João V, to give over their struggle.;x

Portugal had initial agreements with France, but in 1703, due to commercial interests and the possibility of expanding the borders of Brazil, and seeing the course of war turning in favor of the Grand alliance, Portugal signed the treaties of Methuen with England, entering the war on her side. The main purpose of the treaty was to allow free introduction of English wool and cloths to Portugal in exchange of free entry of Portuguese wine into England (Port wine). The treaty made in effect Portugal an economic and political satellite of England, was effectively in place all the way to 1750, when King D José I choose to ignore it, even while it was still formally in effect until 1836.

EVENTHIST260054;When Manuel I ascended to the throne he married the Infanta Isabel of Spain to solidify his position on the throne. Isabel told Manuel that she would only marry him if he expelled the Jews. So Manuel issued a decree forcing all Jews to leave Portugal by October 1497. He tried to convert as many Jews to Christianity as he could to keep them in Portugal. Jewish parents were ordered to take their children to Lisbon. Upon arrival, the parents were informed that their children were going to be taken away from them and were to be given to Catholic families to be raised as good Catholics. Some parents agreed to be baptized, along with their children, while others succumbed and handed over their children. In October 1497, about 20,000 Jews came to Lisbon to prepare for departure to other lands. They were herded into the courtyard of Os Estaos Palace where priests attempted to convert them. Those who did not convert were told they forfeited their freedom and would become slaves.;x

EVENTHIST260071;In January of 1580, King Sebastião died quite unexpectedly in his sleep. Predeceased by his uncle, Henrique, the royal house of Aviz had officially died out. Duchess Catarina Bragança had the best claim to the throne but many prominent nobles were unwilling to overlook her gender.

Both leaders were killed and Sebastião's body was never recovered. With his death, Portuguese forces were routed and many nobles were captured. Control of the Portuguese Kingdom went to Sebastião's uncle, Henrique, who focused on paying ransoms for the captured nobles.

Tired of financing wars that provided at best, modest gains, the nobles petitioned the King for an end to the warfare. When he refused, they revolted and pushed for recognition of the claims of Duchess Catarina Bragança to the throne. Lacking support, Sebastião was quickly captured and Catarina assumed the title, Queen of Portugal.;x

EVENTHIST260086;Historically in 1567 there was an Ecclesiastical Council at Goa that decided that all non-Catholic religions were intrinsically wrong and harmful in themselves and that it was the duty of the King of Portugal to spread the Catholic faith. This led to many harsh sanctions throught the Portuguese Asian empire against non-Catholics and the all but forced conversion of many to Catholicism.

EVENTHIST260091;In 1580, a regency council convened in Portugal to settle the succession. With the death of Sebastião I, Portugal was left with no clear heir. In 1580, several people had claims to the throne: Filipe II of Spain, D. Antonio, and D. Catarina, the Duchess of Bragança. Filipe II sent diplomats to Lisbon to convince the aristocracy that he was the ideal heir for Portugal. If the Kingdom entered into a personal union with Spain, Filipe II would allow Portugal to keep its own laws and Cortes. Given its position of weakness, Spain's offer was more than generous. Responding in kind, the nobles had no choice but to accept the offer.;x

On Vasco da Gama's return voyage to India in 1502 he first stopped at Cochin where he founded a feitoria under the Raja's protection and persuaded him to sell spices to the Portuguese at fixed prices. After De Gama's departure in 1503 Calicut attempted to restore his rule over Cochin and burnt the city to the ground, although the Portuguese traders were able to offer sanctuary to the Raja in their feitoria. Later that year another fleet arrived and it left a small force under Duarte Pacheco Pereira to defend the city and build a fortress.

When he sailed to Zanzibar to resupply he attempted to overawe the locals. After a brief skirmish on one of the beaches its sheik agreed to pay tribute to Portugal. This was done under unwillingly and only one other payment was made until the Portuguese conquered Mombasa in 1598 and became a much more imminent threat.

He resolved to avenge this insult and the Sheik of Malindi, happy to see injury done to his rival, offered troops.

EVENTHIST260113;D. Sebastião I appointed Francisco Barreto Captião-Mor of an expedition to capture the goldmines of Monomotapa and Capitão da Moçambique in 1569. However the expedition took quite a while to assemble and Barreto didn't leave Portuguese-controlled Sena on the Zambezi River until 1572. It achieved some military successes, but was decimated by disease, including the death of Barreto in July 1573. Vasco Fernandes Homem succeeded him and withdrew the expedition back to Moçambique to recuperate. He was determined that this time the expedition would take the route through Sofala to reach Monomotapa. He reached some of the gold and silver mines and forced the local chief to pay tribute. The outpost he left behind to exploit the silver mines was overwhelmed and destroyed not long after his return to Moçambique. The most important legacies of the expedition were the opening of the area to Portuguese merchants, the consolidation of Portuguese control of the Zambezi River Valley with the establishment of captaincies at Sena and Tete and the knowledge that due to the dispersed nature of the gold mines it was much easier to gain it by trade than by conquest.;x

EVENTNAME260134;Modification of the flag of Portugal;x
EVENTHIST260134;In 1577, during the reign of Sebastião I and on the eve of the fatal Battle of Alcácer Quibir, the flag was again modified. The number of castles was permanently fixed at seven and the royal crown was converted into a closed three-arched crown, which symbolized a stronger royal authority. \n \nAfter Sebastião's reign, ogival shield became a rounded one (so-called ''Portuguese type'' shield) in 1640 and was converted to a samnitic (''French type'') shield in 1707. Flag's crown was adapted to fit the contemporary trends in 1667 and 1707. \nWith the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and Algarves, shield and flag were changed again in 1816. The coat of arms, whose shield became rounded again, now rested upon a blue-filled yellow armillary sphere (arms of Brazil) surmounted by a beret-bearing five-arched crown on a white background.;x

EVENTHIST260141;In 1628 Jerómino de Barros, envoy to the Monomotapa, was killed at court. Simultaneously an embargo on trade was imposed during which many Portuguese traders were killed. This appears to have been a reaction to large numbers of Dominican missionaries undermining the traditional power structures. This caused the Portuguese to support Mavura against the current Paramount Chief Inhambo, who was forced to seek refuge north of the Zambezi River.

Dom Luís de Vasconcelos e Sousa, 3rd Count of Castelo Melhor, used Afonso's mental instability to befriend him and persuade him that his mother, Luisa, is working to take the throne of Portugal for herself. Afonso was convinced. He banished his mother to a convent and made Count of Castelo Melhor his secret notary (escrivão da puridade), position in which the favorite was able to exercise the functions of first minister. The new leader of Portugal continued the successes in war against Spain, but he was unable to maintain the internal stability. Without a strong central figure from the royal family, Count's authority began to erode as various political factions struggled for power. Count of Castelo Melhor was deposed and exiled in 1667, shortly before Afonso himself suffered the same fate.;x

EVENTNAME260161;War of Acclamation;x
EVENTHIST260161;By the 1640s, the nobility of Portugal were more than just annoyed with their Spanish captivity. None of the supposed benefits of the union with Spain had come to pass. Despite Filipe I's assurances that Spain would respect the Portuguese constitution and its customes, by the time of Filipe III, taxes were imposed and most all key posts in the government were held by Castilians. Portugal's colonial possessions were also under attack with Spain's enemies, the English and the Dutch. Frustrated by a union that had out lived its usefulness, a group of conspirators began to meet regularly and chose the Duke of Bragança to be their future sovereign. Although a mild-mannered man, the conspiring nobles chose the duke as he had the best claim to throne. Additionally, his confidence was bolstered by his wife, the scheming Luisa de Guzman, daughter of the Spanish Duke of Medina Sidonia. Having orchestrated their rebellion perfectly, the nobles quickly took the palace and the people of Lisbon took control of the city. News of the succesful revolt rapidly spread and one by one the Portuguese defeated the Spanish garrisons.

The Anglo-French negotiations at Tours in 1444 led to the marriage of his daughter Margaret to the English King Henry VI in 1445. Meanwhile Charles VII of France had helped René to pacify Lorraine. As a thank you, René accompanied Charles VII on his victorious campaigns of 1449-50 against the English in Normandy. On his wife's death (1453), her duchy of Lorraine passed to René's son John. With Louis XI of France his relations were generally strained, and Louis forced him to yield Anjou to the French crown. René performed a balancing act through his career and his ties to the English crown could maybe have led to a different course for Provence.;x

Naples was defended by Isabelle of Lorraine with the support of Pope Eugenius IV. For three years Alfons conducted as much a diplomatic war as a military one, gaining allies to his cause from the Neapolitan nobles. In 1438, René of Anjou paid a huge ransom to Burgundy for his release, and arrived in the Kingdom, but since he had exhausted his funds his allies abandoned him and he had to retreat to Naples. A long siege was then established, during which the Infante Don Pedro was killed by a chance shot to the great grief of his brother. The support of the Genoese fleet allowed René to sustain the besieged capital with success until 1 June 1442, when 300 Aragonese well-armed men entered the town through an open drain accessible during the dry season, revealed to Alfons' son Ferrante by some prisoners. After several hours of fighting and in spite of the stealthy move inside the city walls, Naples withstood the Aragonese and Alfons was forced to retreat to Sicily. After recovering the rest of the Kingdom, René entered the capital in triumph the year after.

After much bribing, negotiation and behind the scene diplomacy, Maurice was summoned to either leave or suffer war.

This succeeded in 1814 and again in 1815 when foreign armies brought Louis XVIII on the throne. Louis XVIII was the brother of the Executed King Louis of France and in early life was known as the Comte de Provence. He remained in Paris after the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789 but escaped to Belgium two years later. After King Louis' execution in 1793 he proclaimed himself regent, and after the death of his brother's heir in 1795, he took the title Louis XVIII.

EVENTHIST194206;Thanks to its position between the Gujarat Sultans and the Mughals, Malwa was conquered twice, by Sher Shah in 1542 and by the Mughals in 1561. The King of Malwa, Baz Bahadur, was forced to flee his capital of Mandu and arrived at Chittor, capital of the powerful Rajput Kingdom of Mewar.

EVENTNAME398001;Crusades against the Hussites;x
EVENTHIST398001;Emperor Zikmund made several attempts to subdue the Hussites by military force and had these campaigns declared 'crusades' by the Pope. The first and biggest 'Hussite crusade' was called for on March 17th 1420. Although there were some men from as far as Castile, England and France in the armies, the crusading armies consisted mostly of Hungarians, Bohemians and Germans, i.e. subjects of Zikmund and his allies among the German princes. Morale and organization were usually bad, and one defeat, at one occasion even only the terrifying effect of a disciplined Hussite army singing its war songs, sufficed to scatter the army and end the campaign. Therefore all these attempts eventually failed. The 'crusaders' were often given permission to loot and rob in Bohemia, no matter if they were crossing Catholic or Hussite lands, which attracted all sorts of criminals and adventurers to the crusades and caused much dissent among the populace.;x

EVENTHIST398010;After the victory of the Utraquists and the elimination of the influence of radical Hussites who had before prevented a settlement with Zikmund and the Church, negotiations on the exact terms of a compromise, referring to both political and religious questions, continued for two years, and the differences were eventually resolved. On July 5th a Bohemian diet assembled at the Moravian town of Jihlava (or Iglau) accepted the 'compactata', four articles containing concessions to the religious demands of the Hussites that had found the consent of the Council of Basel, subjected themselves to the authority of the council and the Church and acknowledged Zikmund as King of Bohemia. This finally restored peace in Bohemia and relieved the Utraquists from excommunication. Zikmund entered Bohemia and assumed the rule of the Kingdom in Prague on August 23rd 1436.;x

EVENTHIST3415;Liberating it from the Tatar invaders, the Muscovite state gathered strength and so did the Russian Orthodox Church. In 1448, not long before the Byzantine Empire collapsed, the Russian Church became, in effect, independent from the Patriarchate of Constantinople. Metropolitan Jonas, installed by the Council of Russian bishops in 1448, was given the title of Metropolitan of Moscow and All Russia. In the centuries to come, the growing might of the Muscovite state went hand in hand with the growing authority of the Autocephalous Russian Church. In 1589 Jeremias II, Patriarch of Constantinople, fleeing from Turkish oppression, visited Moscow. The Russians managed to persuade him to appoint metropolitan Job of Moscow patriarch - the final move towards full independence for the Russian Church.;x

He undertook an extremely vigorous reform of church discipline and ritual with a view to purging accretions and eccentricities from the Russian rites. His reforms, particularly his correction of service books from the Greek (1654), created a schism in the church and inspired the formation of a major opposition sect, the Raskolniki, who retained the older usages banned by Nikon. Heterodox sects such as the Dukhobors formed and attached themselves to the Raskolniki to avoid persecution. By 1658, Nikon had aroused sufficiently powerful opposition to bring about his banishment, and in 1666 he was deposed and degraded. He was a figure unique in Russian church history, for he opposed any interference by the state in church affairs and considered the two institutions to be distinct and separate. His reforms were maintained after he was deposed.;x

The letter contained instructions on the yearly tribute that the vassal 'Russia' must now pay. The Czar had no chance to protest as no one in Moscow could understand Chinese.

EVENTHIST3422;In 1697, the 15 years old Charles XII ascended the Swedish throne. Seeing the opportunity, the Russian Czar Peter I allied with Denmark and Poland-Saxony in 1699. However, with British and Dutch naval assistance, Charles XII landed on Zealand and promptly defeated the Danes, then moved to Estland where his badly outnumbered Swedes (1 to 5) won a crushing victory over the Russians. Instead of finishing the Russians, Charles moved against August II of Poland-Saxony and drove him out of Poland in 1704 (having the pro-Swedish Stanislas Leszinski elected King), then subjugating Saxony in 1706. While the Russians started the construction of St-Petersburg (1703) and rebuilt their armies, they also took parts of Estland (1704-1706). Charles then decided to march to Moscow via the Ukraine where the Cossacks under Mazeppa had again risen in revolt (1708). The harsh winter and Russian raids decimated his army and he was finally beaten at the battle of Poltava in 1709. The wounded King escaped to the Ottomans. The Russians were encircled by the Ottomans on the Prut River, but Peter succeeded through bribery to obtain a safe conduct in exchange for Azov. While Charles was still exiled in Turkey, Russian, Danish, Hanoverian and even Prussian troops captured most of the Swedish territory around the Baltic. Having emerged from Turkish internment, Charles got killed in 1718 in front of the Norwegian fortress of Frederickshald. The peace treaties that followed Sweden lost most of her Baltic empire.;x

While he drew his officers from the nobility, he conscripted peasants and townspeople into the other ranks. The troops were equipped with flintlock firearms and bayonets of Russian make, uniforms were provided, and regular drilling was introduced. For the artillery, obsolete cannons were replaced with new mortars and guns designed by Russian specialists or even by Peter himself (he drew up projects of his own for multi-cannon warships, fortresses, and ordnance). The Army Regulations of 1716 were particularly important - they required officers to teach their men how to act in battle, and to show initiative in the face of the enemy. For the navy, Peter's reign saw the construction, within a few years, of 52 battleships and hundreds of galleys and other craft - thus a powerful Baltic fleet was brought into being. Several special schools prepared their pupils for military or naval service and finally enabled Peter to dispense with foreign experts.;x

This date is taken as the founding date of St. Petersburg. In the spring of the following year, Peter established the fortress of Kronslot, later Kronshtadt, on Kotlin Island in the Gulf of Finland, to protect the approaches to the delta. At the same time, he founded the Admiralty shipyard on the riverbank opposite the Peter-Paul Fortress - in 1706 its first warship was launched. Around the fortress and shipyard Peter began the building of a new city to serve as his 'window on Europe'. In 1712 the capital of Russia was transferred there from Moscow, although it was still formally on Swedish land. But only under the despotic rule of Czarina Ekaterina II the Great, the most Europeanlike city of St. Petersburg would be imposed as the new capital of the Russian Empire with the construction of the Winter Palace, the Czarina's winter imperial residence.

Martial discipline was extended to civil institutions, and an officer of the guards was always on duty in the Senate.

At the same time, Russia was pushing for her own candidate, the Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, son-in-law of the Czarina Catherine I. After much bribing, negotiation and behind the scene diplomacy, Maurice was summoned to either leave or suffer war. It started in 1727, with Russia firmly committed and sending 8,000 troops to conquer the Duchy within 8 days.

Naturally, the two opposing parties of the Riksdag were embroiled in a bitter fight over the choice of a crown prince. The Caps argued for the Danish prince Frederick, but the Hats had found another candidate in Adolf Frederick of Holstein-Gottorp. In 1743 Adolf Frederik was elected heir to the throne of Sweden by the Hats, who favored a foreign policy that would regain Swedish hegemony in the Baltic. The Hats hoped by their choice to obtain better conditions of peace from the Russian empress Elizabeth, who was favorable to the house of Gottorp.;x

EVENTNAME3437;Czar Paul I's Liberal Legislation;x
EVENTHIST3437;Paul I, in an effort to strengthen the autocracy, reversed many of Catherine's policies - he reestablished centralized administrative agencies she had abolished in 1775, increased bureaucratic control in local government, and sought to impose limits on the authority of the nobles. While Catherine caused many ordinary Russians to be enslaved through serfdom, Paul was the first Russian czar to limit the work required of these unfortunate people. At Gatchina, Paul educated their children, lent them money, instituted a system of free medical care, gave them more land for their use, and upgraded agricultural technology. In short, he was a model landlord. When it came to Russia's most humble people, as both czar and grand duke, he sought to end their suffering and improve their lives. In this, he put into action the Enlightenment ideas parroted, but never followed unless it suited her, by his mother.;x

EVENTNAME3438;Czar Alexander I's Liberal Legislation;x
EVENTHIST3438;Alexander abolished many barbarous and cruel punishments then practiced and in 1802 introduced a more orderly administration of government by the creation of eight ministries. He improved the condition of the serfs and promoted education, doubling the number of Russian universities by establishing those at Saint Petersburg, Kharkiv, and Kazan. Nevertheless, despite the humanitarian ideas inculcated in him by his tutor La Harpe and despite his own wish to make his people happy, Alexander lacked the energy necessary to carry out the most urgent reform, the full abolition of serfdom. The institution of serfdom was, in the Czar's own words, 'a degradation' that kept Russia in a disastrously backward state. But to liberate the serfs, who composed three-quarters of the population, would arouse the hostility of their noble masters.;x

EVENTHIST3440;Stanislas II Poniatowsky (1764-1795) had been elected King of Poland under Russian pressure. The favorite of Catherine II of Russia, he aspired to reform the conditions of his realm, described as 'anarchy tempered by civil war'. Russia placed her supporters in the 1767 Confederation of Slutsk to prevent any curtailment in the Liberum Veto. Civil war occurred in 1768 and by 1772, the powers of Russia, Prussia and Austria, under the inspiration of Frederick II, proceeded to the first partition of Poland, taking border provinces from her and demanding that the Liberum Veto be maintained and all reforms abandoned.;x

Influenced by Russia, the opposition forced the King to 'join' and called Russian troops to restore order. This led to the partition of the country in 1793, between her neighbouring countries, which deprived Poland of most of her territory. She would disappear after the 1794 popular uprising of Kosciuszko and the final dissolution of the state in 1795.;x

EVENTNAME3783;The Restoration of the French Monarchy;x
EVENTHIST3783;Many countries had viewed the French revolution with neutral mistrust or eager interest, but with the Reign of Terror and the Execution of King Louis most countries became abhorred. The New Republic and its ideas undermined the 'Old Order' that existed in most European countries. Those several alliances were set up to restore the Bourbons to the French Throne, crush the revolution and get Europe back to normal again. This succeeded in 1814 and again in 1815 when foreign armies brought Louis XVIII on the throne. Louis XVIII was the brother of the Executed King Louis of France and in early life was known as the Comte de Provence. He remained in Paris after the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789 but escaped to Belgium two years later. After King Louis' execution in 1793 he proclaimed himself regent, and after the death of his brother's heir in 1795, he took the title Louis XVIII. He lived as an exile in various European countries until he became King after Napoléon's first abdication in 1814. On Napoléon's return to power in 1815, however, Louis again fled to Belgium;x

For this reason he decided to create a scientific institute like those in London, Paris or Berlin. The Academy of Sciences was created by Peter's decree the 22nd January 1724. Scientific meetings of the Academy were already held in 1725, and in December 1725, after Peter's the Great death, the official opening took place. The event was of great importance for revival of the country: every field of life in Russia needed development of science, education and culture. Working at the Academy project Peter the First invited a number of outstanding European scientists.;x

Through the requests of Daniel Bernoulli and Jakob Hermann, Euler was appointed to the mathematical-physical division of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Euler left Basel on 5 April 1727. He had joined the Russian Academy of Sciences two years after it had been opened by Catherine I the wife of Peter the Great. At the Academy Euler had many colleagues who would provide an exceptional environment for him: he carried out projects dealing with cartography, science education, magnetism, fire engines, machines, and ship building. The core of his research program was now set in place: number theory, infinitesimal analysis including its emerging branches, differential equations and the calculus of variations, and rational mechanics.;x

EVENTHIST24029;In the 18th century Malta became a place of interest to the ever-expanding empires: Austria, England, France, and even Russia. Ekaterina II considered the island a great asset in her plans for expansion in the Balkans, and indeed, in 1768 a Russian squadron suddenly arrived off Malta, trying to enlist the Order's military help in their expedition against the Ottomans. Simultaneously, the empress' agents attempted to rouse the Maltese population against the Knights, and only with the help of the French royal court did the Order evade the threat. However, the French Revolution caused the Knights great financial problems, as over half of their lands were confiscated. When with the third partition of Poland the Russian czar took control of the Order's estates in Courland and Volyn, he decided to follow his mother's strategy, and declared himself the Protector of the Order of St. John. Distressed by the Revoltion and the Knights' internal problems, Grand Master Emmanuel de Rohan accepted the offer in 1797.;x

The use of heavy bombard guns breached the walls of the Tatar city, which was promptly overwhelmed and annexed. In 1556, in the wake of its success against Kazan four years earlier, Czar Ivan IV the Terrible launched a new expedition against the Khanate of Astrakhan, southward down the Volga. The capture of Astrakhan opened an access to the Caspian Sea and put the whole Volga basin under Russian control. Cities like Samara (1586), Saratov (1590) and Tsaritsyne (1589) were founded along the river to ensure proper control.;x

EVENTNAME40019;Russian claims on Lithuania;x
EVENTHIST40019;Ivan III proclaimed himself Czar of all Russians, basing this claim both on his marriage with Zoe Paleologus and having prevailed as strongest of the Russian principalities. This provoked conflict with the Grand Duke of Lithuania who still had many Russian subjects. Russia accepted the defection of several Lithuanian nobles to its crown and pursued an aggressive policy to recover the lands it considered its rightful possessions. The two countries fought several wars between 1490 and 1505, resulting in a gradual expansion of the Czar's territories towards the west.;x

EVENTHIST40025;As part of his preparations for the oncoming campaign against Kazan, Ivan IV undertook certain measures to strengthen the army. A decree of 1550 abrogating mestnichestvo, establishing the order and subordination of commanding generals was aimed at increasing the effectiveness of the army. The decree, however, failed to eradicate completely the disputes among the generals on the march. Six companies of musketeers (strel'tsy) were created in 1550 as a small standing army, whose goal was to give more firepower to Russian army, and introduced new ways of conducting warfare. A decree on service of 1556 set norms for the nobles' military obligations, creating and regulating stricter order of military service.;x

EVENTHIST3412;The defection of one of Ivan's best field commanders, Prince Andrey Kurbsky, to Poland in 1564 greatly shocked the Czar, who announced later that year his intention of abdicating in view of the boyars' betrayal. The Muscovites, however, led by the clergy, implored him to continue to rule, and in 1565 he acceded to their request on condition that he should be allowed to deal with the traitors as he wished and that he should form an Oprichnina-i.e., an aggregate of territory that would be administered separately from the rest of the state and put under his immediate control as crown land. The term Oprichnina also refers to the reign of terror which was conducted by the oprichniki, members of the tsar's new court, who were primarily drawn from the lower gentry and foreign population. The terror culminated with the proscription of the entire population of Novgorod and the sack of that northern city, which opposed Muscovite dominance (1570). The policy reduced the boyars' political power, disrupted the Russian economy, and contributed to the centralization of the Muscovite state. After 1572, when the oprichniki were disbanded, the term dvor (court) replaced Oprichnina.;x

In 1558 he went to war in an attempt to establish Russian rule over Livonia (in present-day Latvia and Estonia). Russia was at first victorious and succeeded in destroying the Livonian knights, but their ally Lithuania became an integral part of Poland in 1569. The war dragged on - while the Swedes (guarding their own interests in Estonia) supported Poland against Russia, the Crimean Tatars attacked Astrakhan and even made an extensive incursion into Russia in 1571 - they sacked and burned Moscow, leaving only the Kremlin standing.;x

EVENTHIST3420;Stenka Razin (or Stepan Timofeyevich) was a Don Cossack hetman who carried out a series of successful raids on Persian and Russian settlements 1667-69. Having acquired great fame and wealth, Razin launched a new campaign in 1670 against the czar's fortress cities on the Volga. With a force of about 7,000 Cossacks, he seized Tsaritsyn and Astrakhan. In both towns Razin and his men engaged in drunken orgies and perpetrated savage atrocities against the nobles and military officers - he also replaced the local governments with Cossack institutions of self-rule. Razin continued his advance up the Volga, and along the way he incited the serfs and urban lower classes to join his rebellion. He captured Saratov and proceeded to Simbirsk, while his insurrection spread throughout the Volga region and even into some of the central Russian provinces. Alarmed at Razin's success, Czar Alexis sent an army to relieve Simbirsk. The force inflicted a decisive defeat on Razin's undisciplined and badly equipped troops. Razin fled to the Don, but on April 24, 1671, he was captured by loyalist Cossacks and turned over to the tsarist authorities.

EVENTNAME3436;The Reactionary Policy;x
EVENTHIST3436;After the Pugachev revolt, Catherine realized that for her the people were more to be feared than pitied, and that, rather than freeing them, she must tighten their bonds. Before her accession to power, Catherine had planned to emancipate the serfs, on whom the economy of Russia was based. When confronted with the realities of power, Catherine saw very quickly that emancipation of the serfs would never be tolerated by the owners, whom she depended upon for support, and who would throw the country into disorder once they lost their own means of support. (The fortune of a noble was evaluated not in lands but in the 'souls' he owned.) Catherine instead turned her attention to organizing and strengthening a system that she herself had condemned as inhuman. She imposed serfdom on the Ukrainians who had until then been free. By distributing the crown lands to her favorites and ministers, she worsened the lot of the peasants, who had enjoyed certain autonomy. At the end of her reign, there was scarcely a free peasant left in Russia.;x

He supposedly intended to grant constitutions, introduce laws, abolished feudalism, create efficient governments and foster education, science, literature and the arts. The other powers of Europe looked on with alarm at an expansionist France, bringing its revolutionary ideals and fervour abroad in the wake of Napoléon's military might. Through the Treaties of Tilsit Russia became briefly an ally of France and that is when it attacked Sweden which couldn't count on help of any of its allies at that time. Russia took over Finland easily enough, and though it later turned against France once more, Finland would remain under Russian rule for over a century. Rather than fully incorporate Finland into Russia, tsar Alexander granted Finland autonomy as a grand duchy and Russia respected the constitution, and civil and religious rights already established under Swedish rule, at least for the time being.;x

EVENTHIST3574;The death of Abbas I in 1629 consigned Iran to a long and painful slide into chaos. The decline resulted from weak rulers, interference by the women of the harem in politics, the re-emergence of Kizilbash rivalries, maladministration of state lands, excessive taxation, the decline of trade, and the weakening of Safavid military organization.;x

EVENTNAME3998;The Safavid State;x
EVENTHIST3998;The Safavid movement was originally founded by Seyh Safiuddin in the thirteenth-century as a contemplative brand of Sufism, but it later evolved in a militant Shia Heresy ideology. Proponents of the movement were eventually able to take advantage of the disorganized political situation in what is today modern Iran, to form the country of Persia. This newly formed Persian nation, with its militant Shia followers, was ably to quickly conquer territory in the surrounding region.;x

EVENTNAME21817;The Shia State of the Safavids;x
EVENTHIST21817;The Safavid sect found itself vying for political power when supported by their militant turkish Shia followers. Although of persian ancestry, the Safavids had adopted a turkic dialect. During Ismail's rule, turkish nobles would have the most sway in court. Upon taking Tabriz, Ismail, with the support of his militant followers, proclaimed Shia the faith of the land. Religion was to prove a unifying point for the Safavid state.;x

EVENTHIST65050;Since Tabriz wouldn't eternally withstand attacks from the Ottomans, the capital of Persia was moved to Qazvin. Shah Tahmasp I and his successors maintained the capital in Qazvin until 1598, when Shah Abbas moved it once again to Isfahan. During the reign of Tahmasp I, many buildings were erected in Qazvin, including Ali Q'apu and Chenel-Sotoun palaces which preceded their counterparts in Isfahan.;x

EVENTNAME65055;Karim Khan;x
EVENTHIST65055;After destroying his Afghani enemies, Karim Khan turned to rebuilding the country. While technically in charge of the country, he used Ismail III, the last representative of the Safavid dynasty, as a puppet ruler. During his reign, Karim Khan managed to bring order and prosperity to Persia. The roads, only a few years ago infested by gangs of all kinds, were now the safest in the region to travel, and the economy (and especially agriculture) destroyed by the rampage of Nadir Shah and 10 years of instability that followed his death, was finally on the rise.;x

EVENTNAME254010;Khiva and Shiite Governors;x
EVENTHIST254010;When Persia conquered parts of Khwarizim, Shiite governors were setup up in the various regions. This Shiite governors offended the sensibilities of the Sunni steppe population.

EVENTNAME254022;Persian Attack on Hormouz;x
EVENTHIST254022;Shah Abbas was outraged by the Portuguese attack on the Persian garrison on the island of Qeshm to secure the local wells for their waterless island of Hormouz. He ordered the Portuguese expelled from Qeshm and Hormouz even though he had no navy. He offered trade privileges and reduced customs taxes to the English East India Company as well as custody of the castle of Hormouz itself for their assistance with the subtle reminder that the Dutch might agree if the English refused.;x

EVENTNAME254023;Safavid-Timurid Alliance;x
EVENTHIST254023;In 1510 Babur and Shah Ismail I formed an alliance in an attempt to stem the expansion of the Uzbeks. In return for Ismail's assistance, Babur permitted Ismail to act as a suzerain over him and his followers. Shah Ismail also reunited Babur with his sister Khanzada, who had been imprisoned by and forced to marry the recently deceased Shaybani. Ismail provided Babur with a large wealth of luxury goods and military assistance, for which Babur reciprocated by adopting the dress and outward customs of the Shias. Coins were to be struck in Ismail's name, and the Khutba at the Mosque was also to be read in his name. In effect, Babur was to hold Samarkand as a vassal territority for the Persian Shah, though in Kabul, coins and the Khutba would remain in Babur's name.;x

EVENTNAME254300;Ismail's Ambition;x
EVENTHIST254300;Unfortunately for Alwand, a similar situation, to the battles for irvan, occurred when his 'superior' forces encountered those of Ismail. Alwand's defeat at Shurur, allowed 15 year old Ismail to march victoriously into Tabriz and finally found the Safavid state. Meanwhile Alwand retreated to Diyarbakir in hopes of gathering a new force.;x

EVENTNAME254302;Acquisition of Iraq;x
EVENTHIST254302;In the summer of 1508, Ismail sent an envoy to Barik Beg, then the governor of Iraq for Sultan Murad. Barik Beg allegedly accepted the Sh'ia as a symbol of his submission to Shah Ismail. However, when Ismail marched on the city in person, Barik Beg and Sultan Murad fled, effectively ending Murad's five year rule. Ismail ordered an execution of all the clansmen in the city, ostensibly in retribution for their desecration of Safavid regalia.;x

EVENTNAME17409;Civil chaos in Savoy;x
EVENTHIST17409;After the death of Duke Charles Ier who had made in his whole life all possible efforts to free Savoy of the strong French political interference, the duchy was thrown again into chaos since the successor to the throne of Chambéry, Duke Charles II, was still a minor (he became Duke when he was only 8 months old!) and a planned Charles VIII's military campaign in Italy was rumoured. The Duke's mother, Bianca of Montferrat, had temporarily assumed the regency of the duchy due to her son's under age, but the presence of different factions that sought and received some support from the French King, contributed to the political instability of Savoy as to establish de facto a sort of French protectorate. Being Savoy still an imperial fief, Maximilian I King of the Romans and future Holy Roman Emperor tried to get the Savoyard allegiance in order to drive the French out of Italy. The strategic position of Savoy would put the ducal independence at risk, leaving the country in anarchy until the end of the Italian wars in which Savoy, historically drifted into the French orbit, gained complete independence only in 1559 when the treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis was signed between France and Spain.;x

EVENTHIST17412;When Duke Amédée IX died in 1472 the successor to the throne, his son Philibert, was still a minor. Thus his wife Yolande de France, Charles VII's daughter, took the regency until Philibert's majority. Since Yolande dind't want to confirm the traditional alliance with the Swiss confederates, she decided to side with Charles le Téméraire, Duke of Burgundy. Her decision so displeased his brother Louis XI of France, Charles's archenemy, that, in order to overthrow her regency, he supported Amédée IX's brother, Philippe de Bresse. The war that followed between the Burgundians and the Swiss, the latter with the support of French and Milanese troops brought to the loss of Valais territories in favour of the Swiss confederation. The internal struggle between local nobles that broke out following the war was eventually ended by Philippe de Bresse who proclaimed himself protector of Duke Philibert 'the Hunter' until the Duke's death, which occurred in 1482.;x

EVENTNAME17420;The Expulsion of the Vaudois;x
EVENTHIST17420;The Vaudois were an small religious group whose origins stretch back to the teachings of a Peter Waldo in the late 12th century. They were declared heretical in 1184. Most were killed or converted in the persecution that followed, but strong communities persisted in the valleys between the Dauphine and Piemonte. In 1532 their leaders met with representatives of Jean Calvin from Geneva and their faith was reconciled with Calvinism. In France they participated in the Huguenot 'state within a state', and contacts with their co-religionists in Piemonte were strong. When Louis XIV expelled the Protestants from France, many sought refuge with the Piedmontese Vaudois just across the French border. Louis demanded that Savoy expel the Vaudois, and Vittorio Amedeo II reluctantly complied. The Vaudois under Henri Arnaud went to Switzerland, but never forgot the valleys that they had inhabited for 500 years. Many of their children were distributed among Catholic households and institutions to be brought up as Catholics.;x

They fought their way back to their valleys. Vittorio Amedeo II called for support from the French and mobilized his forces to expel the Vaudois, while the protestant powers prepared an expedition to support them, and raise the Huguenots in France. Faced with this threat to his state, and the French demand that he hand over several important fortresses, Vittorio Amedeo II abandoned his alliance with France and went to war as an ally of England and Holland. In return for their support Savoy agreed to give full toleration to the Vaudois, and and to allow them to accept protestant refugees.

EVENTNAME275011;The Holy Shroud;x
EVENTHIST275011;It is believed to be the Jesus' burial shroud. The known provenance of this cloth dates to 1357, when the widow of the French knight Geoffroy de Charny had it displayed in a church at Lirey, France. During the fourteenth century, the Shroud was often publicly exposed, though not continuously, and also denounced as a fraud but indulgences for pilgrimages to see the Shroud were however prescribed by the Antipope Clement VII. In 1418, in order to provide protection against criminal bands the Lirey canons handed the Shroud over to Humbert of Villersexel, Marguerite of Charny's husband, who moved it to his castle at Montfort and later to Saint-Hippolyte-sur-Doubs, in his estates. After Humbert's death, his widow kept the Shroud in spite of claims of ownership by the canons of Lirey and travelled with it to various expositions, notably in Liège and Geneva. In 1453 in Geneva, she sold the image to Louis I of Savoy in exchange for a castle in Varambon. Louis of Savoy, the new owner, stored the Shroud in Chambéry in the newly-built Sainte Chapelle, which Pope Paul II shortly thereafter raised to the dignity of a collegiate church. In 1464, by an accord drawn up in Paris Louis I agreed to pay an annual fee to the Lirey canons in exchange for their dropping claims of ownership of the cloth. The accord specifically noted that the Shroud had been given to the church of Lirey by Geoffrey de Charny, lord of Savoisy and Lirey, and that it had then been transferred to Louis of Savoy by Marguerite de Charny. That agreement finally legitimated the House of Savoy to own the sacred 'Sindon'.;x

#;x
EVENTHIST275012;Louis I of Savoy acquired the cloth, believed to be the Jesus' burial shroud, from Geoffroy de Charny's grand-daughter Marguerite in 1453 in Geneva in exchange for a castle in Varambon, France. He then stored the Shroud in Chambery in the newly-built Sainte Chapelle which the Pope Paul II shortly thereafter raised to the dignity of a collegiate church. Beginning in 1471, the Shroud was moved between many cities of Savoy and Piedmont and also housed there briefly. In 1532 the Shroud suffered damage from a fire in the chapel where it was stored in Chambéry. A drop of molten silver from the reliquary produced a symmetrically-placed mark through the layers of the folded cloth. Chambéry's poor Clare Nuns attempted to repair this damage with patches. In 1578, after having been continuously transferred from one place to another for protection against war devastations, the Shroud arrived at last to its final destination, the Cathedral of Turin. Since then the Shroud was frequently carried out in religious processions and also brought in public exhibitions as well as in private showings only for the most notable people. Turin became an important centre of Christian pilgrimage.;x

EVENTHIST275013;Emmanuel-Philibert of the House of Savoy, also known as Tête de Fer, served in Charles's army during the war against François Ier of France, distinguishing himself by capturing Hesdin in July 1553. A month later, he became duke of Savoy on the death of his father, but this was a nearly empty honor, as the vast majority of his hereditary lands had been occupied and administered by the French since 1536. Instead, he continued to serve the Habsburgs in hopes of recovering his lands, and served Philip II as lieutenant general in Flanders. In this capacity he personally led the Spanish invasion of northern France and won a brilliant victory at Saint-Quentin on 10 August 1557. With the Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis between France and Spain, the duchy was restored to Emmanuel-Philibert, who then married Margaret of Valois, sister of Henry II of France.;x

EVENTHIST275018;Francis Bonaventure was born on August 21st, 1567, at the castle of Sales in Savoy. His father was lord of Nouvelles and (by his marriage) of Boisy, as the eldest son of a prominent nobleman, he was destined, by a father proud of his nobility, for a career in the world and a seat in the senate of Savoy. From 1586 to 1591 he attended the University of Padua to study law and left after taking the Doctor's degree. But his vocation was now clear, though only to himself. He surmounted with quiet, firm dignity the inevitable clash with his father. He was ordained priest on May 13th, 1593, becoming a senior canon of the chapter of Geneva. Francis's great work was to show how ordinary life can be sanctified - every type of ordinary life, but especially that of busy, well-to-do people.

EVENTNAME275033;Witch-hunting in Savoy;x
EVENTHIST275033;The medieval Inquisition tried a large number of witches, but collective witch-hunting was exclusively a modern phenomena. Individual maleficium (Latin for witchcraft) was not uncommon in many rural areas, but it wasn't until scholastic demonology related witches and Sabbaths (night meetings with strong conspiracy elements, including cannibalism, orgies and a sacred oath of loyalty to Satan himself) that societies started to get obsessed with the matter. This conspiracy paranoia can track its roots as far as to the first massacres of Jews and Lepers in the High Middle Ages, when thousands were slaughtered by defeated Crusaders and angry countrymen. But it's in the early 15th century when demonological theories will become fully accepted by the upper classes. The Councils of Constance and Basel are considered to be the first public space in which these concepts, maleficium and Sabbath were publicly related. The work of Johannes Nider (1380-1438), The Formicarius (The Anthill), was a masterpiece of scholastic demonology and marked a new era in witch-hunting. The work of Heinrich Kramer (1430-1505), Malleus Maleficarum (Hammer of the Wicked) was the first work that reaches widespread attention, and works as a inquisitorial manual for witch-hunters. But it's not the Church that tries the most in Modern Ages. On the contrary, civil courts are responsible for 85-90 percent of executions. \n \nNorthern Savoyard valleys were highly affected by witch-hunting, as their proximity to Switzerland (and consequently to both Councils) made the region highly influenced by Inquisitorial practices.;x

EVENTHIST3621;In 1697, the 15 year old Charles XII ascended the Swedish throne. Seeing the opportunity, the Russian Czar Peter I allied with Denmark and Poland-Saxony in 1699. However, with British and Dutch naval assistance, Charles XII landed on Zealand and promptly defeated the Danes, then moved to Estland where his badly outnumbered Swedes (1 to 5) won a crushing victory over the Russians. Instead of finishing the Russians, Charles moved against August II of Poland-Saxony and drove him out of Poland in 1704 (having the pro-Swedish Stanislaw Leszczynski elected King), then subjugating Saxony in 1706. While the Russians started the construction of St-Petersburg (1703) and rebuilt their armies, they also took parts of Estland (1704-1706). Charles then decided to march to Moscow via the Ukraine where the Cossacks under Mazeppa had again risen in revolt (1708). The harsh winter and Russian raids decimated his army and he was finally beaten at the battle of Poltava in 1709. The wounded King escaped to the Ottomans. The Russians were encircled by the Ottomans on the Prut River, but Peter succeeded through bribery to obtain a safe conduct in exchange for Azov. While Charles was still exiled in Turkey, Russian, Danish, Hanoverian and even Prussian troops captured most of the Swedish territory around the Baltic. Having emerged from Turkish internment, Charles got killed in 1718 in front of the Norwegian fortress of Frederickshald. The peace treaties that followed Sweden lost most of her Baltic empire.;x

EVENTNAME273000;Extinction of the Askanians in Wittenberg;x
EVENTHIST273000;The influence of the Askanians who had once been the most powerful dynasty in Eastern Germany slowly faded in the 14th and 15th century. First in Brandenburg, then in Lauenburg and finally 1423 in electoral Saxony the branches got extinct, and the remaining members of the family lacked unity and determination to secure the territories. Instead, the Hohenzollern and Wettins were given the old Askanian lands and took their former rank. The last step in this process was the extinction of the electoral branch in Saxony-Wittenberg with the heirless death of Albrecht III. This caused a tough contest between the Hohenzoller Elector Friedrich of Brandenburg and the Wettin Margrave Friedrich IV of Meissen for Albrecht's possessions. Eventually, Emperor Sigismund decided in favour of the Wettin and granted the Electorate and Saxony-Wittenberg to him. Henceforth, the electoral title remained within the Wettin family that managed to become one of the predominant forces in the Empire while the Askanians left in Anhalt were virtually powerless.;x

When the conflict was over, he demanded a compensation for the damages inflicted to his Thuringian territory of Milowitz and for the ransom of 4000 Gulden he had to pay after being arrested near Gera in 1446. Since Friedrich refused Kaufungen took him to an imperial arbitrarian court. However, the court decided in favour of the elector which caused Kaufungen to leave it angrily and to swear that he would take revenge on Friedrich's own offspring. It was no empty promise: In the night between July 7th and 8th 1455 he kidnapped the Saxonian princes Ernst and Albrecht from the castle of Altenburg with the intention to take them to Bohemia. This could only be prevented by the coincidental help of two charburners who arrested Kaufungen and saved the princes.

EVENTNAME3076;The Fate of Mary Stuart;x
EVENTHIST3076;In 1565 Mary married her cousin Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, an English nobleman. The bridegroom was proclaimed Henry, King of Scots. Their only child was to become James I of England. Mary soon became disenchanted with Henry. He had become overbearing, arrogant and carried away by his new title. He made enemies of some of the powerful nobles and, because of that enmity, there was a plot to kill him. Some thought that Mary had knowledge of the plot. The rift between Mary and her husband became public knowledge. She turned to a Scottish nobleman, a very powerful man, the Earl of Bothwell, for support. He and other Scottish noblemen proposed to do whatever they could to help the Queen in her dilemma. This decision led to a failed explosion plot and to the strangulation death of Darnely. A few months later, Mary and the Earl married. This angered the populace who suspected Bothwell's participation in the murder of their King. Mary's subjects were outraged and turned against her. She was able to lead an army against them, and although it was equal in number to the confederate army, it was visibly inferior in discipline. On June 15, 1567, Mary's forces were defeated at Carberry Hill, and she was forced to abandon Bothwell and surrender herself to the confederate lords. On July 24, at Lochleven, she was prevailed upon to sign an act of abdication in favor of her son, who was crowned as James VI five days afterward at Stirling. Escaping from her island-prison at Lochleven on May 2, 1568, she was able within a few days to assemble an army of 6000 men. On May 12 her army was defeated by the regent Moray at Langside, near Glasgow. Four days afterward, in spite of the entreaties of her best friends, Mary crossed Solway Firth and sought refuge at the court of Elizabeth I, Queen of England, only to find herself a prisoner of Elizabeth for life.;x

Intensification of royal judicial procedures (Star Chamber) and demands for taxes (1635, ship money for naval construction) was faced by Parliamentary opposition (summary of grievances in the 1641 Grand Remonstrance) and execution of royal advisors. The arrest of John Pym, the Puritan leader and the Catholic uprising in Ulster (1641) sparked the war between the Royalists and the Parliament. The decisive reform and new model army of Oliver Cromwell (1599-1658) led to the capture and execution of King Charles I (1649) and the establishment of the English Commonwealth, a military dictatorship controlled by a Lord Protector (Cromwell - 1653) and a reduced (Rump) Parliament. Following successful wars against Holland (1652-1654) and Spain (1654-1659), the monarchy would be re-established by General Monk in 1658, to the profit of Charles II Stuart (1660-1688), a fervent absolutist.;x

EVENTNAME3081;The Restoration of the Stuarts;x
EVENTHIST3081;After years of chaotic civil war in the commonwealth and the death of basically the only person that could realistically receive support from all sides, Cromwell, the situation was, if possible, more confused then ever before. Almost all the Scots hated Cromwell's occupation, with very few actively participating with the regime. This tense situation lasted until Cromwell died in 1659 and the regime crumbled without his guidance. When one group of officers determined to dissolve the remains of the English Long Parliament, called the Rump, a former royalist and commander of the largest force in Britain, George Monck, decided that enough was enough. He promptly marched his army down from Scotland to reinstitute the Rump. However once there he realized that probably the only real long-term solution to the mess was to restore Charles II as King. In February 1660 Monck reversed Pride's Purge, inviting all of the secluded members of the Long Parliament to return to their seats under army protection. A month later the Long Parliament dissolved itself, paving the way for the return of the King. Charles II was restored to the throne and Scotland's Parliament reopened. Because of co-operating in the Cromwellian regime, the Restoration kept Scottish Parliament and Kirk under the control of the monarchy. The Presbyterian governance of the Church was abolished and bishops were imposed on a largely Protestant lowland population. The ideals of the National Covenant seemed to be definitively put at end.;x

EVENTNAME3082;The Glorious Revolution and the Claim of Rights;x
EVENTHIST3082;After the Restoration, the Government tried to reinstate the moderate part of Presbyterian ministers in country's social life. They were given license to preach if they accepted the King's authority, whilst the most radical ones, who believed the King had no right to interfere in the Kirk, were imprisoned, transported or executed. In 1685 when Charles II died and was succeeded by his brother James, paradoxically a declared fervent Catholic was at the head of the Protestant Kirk.He was accepted as King grudgingly by most English people, but when he started to force the issue of equal rights between Catholics and Protestants in the Protestant Commonwealth the issue heated up. In itself it might not have had such dire consequences, but in the light of Louis XIV revoking of the Edict of Nantes and the following the losses in the English Civil War, James VII (II in England) actions caused much anger and discontent. Thus the King's effort on behalf of Catholics was doomed. Seven eminent Englishmen, among them the Tory Earl of Danby and Henry Compton, bishop of London, wrote inviting William of Orange, stadholder in the Netherlands, to help get rid of James VII (II). William in need of an ally against France accepted the invitation and on the 5th of November 1688 his troops landed in Bixham. He slowly advanced almost unopposed on London giving ample time for those still loyal to the highly unpopular King to reconsider. In the end James II realized his weak position and fled to France. James flight was interpreted as an abdication and William was offered the English crown. Many Scots exiles who had fled the Stuart regime returned with William from Holland, and a Scottish convention drafted the Claim of Right, which demanded a free Parliament and a Presbyterian Kirk. The exiled James VII ordered the convention to obey their rightful King, whilst the Scottish Parliament proclaimed William King of Scots and reclaimed their political power. Not all Scots accepted the new situation, there were supporters of the exiled Stuart dynasty, the 'Jacobites', which were assemblying forces in areas beyond government's control for the purpose of a counter-revolution. They believed that the natural order of Scottish society, with the rightful Stuart King at the top, was being destroyed by the Presbyterians.;x

However, Murdac did not inherit his father's character and lacked capable administrative abilities, perhaps in part due to his absence from Scotland for a period of thirteen years following his defeat and capture by the English in the battle of Homildon in 1402. In 1415, Robert I had negotiated the release of his son in exchange for the Earl of Northumberland, but had inhibited any and all activities leading to the release of his captive nephew, King James I, the sole and rightful heir of the deceased King Robert III and thus the Scottish throne.

The prospect of a marriage between James and an English royal had The senior Beaufort's, Thomas, Duke of Exeter, and Henry, Bishop of Winchester, were not only half-brothers of Henry IV but held dominant positions on the household and council in 1423. Hence, in the Beaufort's actively sought to solidify a marriage between James and their neice Joan Beaufort. Their efforts were successful and in February of 1424 James and Joan celebrated their marriage at Southwark with a banquet in the bishop's diocese.;x

EVENTNAME20440;Arrest of Walter Stewart;x
EVENTHIST20440;When King James returned to Scotland, he was assailed by accusations against Walter Stewart of Lennox, Duke Murdac's eldest surviving son and heir. Walter had actively resisted his father's regime and opposed James's release. Nonetheless, James had been quick to secure the support of his aged and experienced uncle, Walter Earl of Atholl, with lucrative settlements in the north east lowlands. The arragements themselves indicated that the King was in no mood to reconcile with Lennox's supporters, some of whom were effectively disinherited of their rightful estates. Recognizing his own weakness and political isolation, Walter of Lennox obeyed a Royal summons to Edinburgh Castle where he and several of his companions were arrested and detained. Duke Murdac failed to resist and seemed to support what he thought was simply a short term reprimand. James was under no such illusions. Walter stood poised to inherit three Earldoms along with his father's claims to the Scottish throne...;x

EVENTHIST20441;James I's Coronation occurred at Scone and was a display of restored royal prestige. James was installed on the throne by his old tutor, Bishop Wardlaw of St. Andrews, and Duke Murdac as Earl of Fife, in accordance with customary procedure. After the ceremony, James conferred knighthood on Duke Murdac's favoured son, Alexander, and several of James's nobles, including the Earls of Wigtown, March, and Angus, his southern allies. This display of renewed monarchy and feudal harmony would reward James in the ensuing weeks. It was at Scone that James called a Parliament, a right reserved for the King and the King alone. Parliament had not formally assembled for almost two decades...;x

EVENTNAME20442;Parliament at Scone;x
EVENTHIST20442;The primary concern of the parliament held immediately after James's coronation was payment of his ransom. To this end, James used the occasion to emphasize his status and rights as King of Scotland. Breaches of the King's peace were forbidden and the punishment for rebellion was restated. He launched an inquest into the crown lands held by his three predecessors and resumed certain grants including those made from the customs revenues which he considered unjustified. The Earls of Douglas and Mar had been the primary benefactors of this Crown patronage which had slowly but surely been wittled away during the last several decades. Hence, with the support of Parliament, James was able to recover the bulk of these revenues. Moreover, parliament was willing to accept a direct taxation, the collection of which was largely successful and represented a triumph for the returning King.;x

EVENTHIST20444;When the exchequer audit was held at Edinburgh, the King put the Scone legislation regarding grants from customs revenues into practice. The act of parliament had alerted the principle pensioners to the threat of their income and hence Alexander, Earl of Mar was present at the audit. Mar's local role in the north-east as protector on the lowlands and the government's lieutenant beyond the Mounth was heavily dependent on revenue from the customs which had been awarded to him by the Albany regime during James I's absence after Mar's efforts at the battle of Harlaw, thirteen years before. Mar's efforts to dissuade James were to no avail, however, and the ensuant evelopments opened up the prospect of renewed instability in the north and with it cateran raiding into the lowlands and the increased influence of the Lord of the Isles, who already held Ross and the Great Glen.;x

EVENTHIST20447;With the death of John Stewart, Earl of Buchan and son of Robert I Duke of Albany, James I was able to bring an abrupt halt to thirty years of Albany Stewart family expansionism in the north. The bulk of the Earl's lands, including the Earldoms of Buchan and Ross, and several lordships in Aberdeenshire, were to pass to his younger brother, Robert Stewart, according to the existing entail. Robert would have inherited both his brother's lands along with his father's political stance and would have been a natural ally of his half-brother, Duke Murdac I, and his neighbour, Alexander, Earl of Mar. James interfered, however, and as a result Robert did not receive his inheritance, instead he settled for a royal pension in return for the resignation of his claims. The rival claims of Alaxendar, Lord of the Isles to the Earldom of Ross were appeased.

EVENTNAME20449;The fall of the Earl of Lennox;x
EVENTHIST20449;James I had needed the support of the Black Douglases to back his increasingly hostile behaviour to the Albany Stewarts. The death of the 4th Earl of Douglas had removed this requisite. Despite the readiness of Murdac I to work with the King, his control of the Earldoms of Fife and Menteith and numerous other lordships restricted royal authority in much of central Scotland. Murdac himself was in his sixties, and his succession represented a considerable political problem. Murdac's son, Walter, could not be allowed to inherit his father's estates. The issue was execerbated by the fact that James had no heir while Murdac had plenty. The Albany Stewarts had murdered James's own older brother and had prompted James's escape from Scotland so many years ago. Thus, James came to the conclusion that Murdac and his family had to be eliminated. The first step was the removal of the Earl of Lennox and his supporters, who had allied with Walter Stewart in order to resist James's release.;x

The Parliament had resisted James's pleas for taxation, and Murdac I may have sided with those opposed to James's aims. The Parliament warned James not to make deals with the Highlanders, referring to his settlement with Alexander, Lord of the Isles and the punishment of the Earl of Mar. James's responded with issuing further statutes against treasonous and rebellious activities, expanding on what he'd passed the year before, that Parliament accepted. The King then used these and Murdac's ties to his son and the Lennox's rebellious activities the year before, to arrest the Duke, his wife, and many of their adherants, placing them under custody in strongholds staunchly royalist.

EVENTHIST20453;Thomas Dunbar, Earl of Moray, brother-in-law of Alexander Lord of the Isles, was a captive in England, in accordance with the terms of the James I's release, and James now moved to secure Moray's release. Moray's apparent promotion gave great consternation to Alexander Stewart, Earl of Mar, who'd previously been stripped of the lucrative Crown customs revenues he'd enjoyed under the Albany Stewart regime. James's recognition of the Lord of Isles's claims to the Earl of Ross had further destabilized the north. Mar's patience was later rewarded and James promoted him to Lieutenant of the North and secured the Earl's succession on his bastard son. With the enlistment of James's aged uncle, the Earl of Atholl, another northern magnate, stability pervailed in the Grampians.;x

EVENTHIST20454;James accompanied with an enlarged royal household consisting of several of Scotland's great magnates, made his way to Aberdeen and then to Iverness where he was to hold a meeting with the Lord of the Isles. The Lord of the Isles was accompanied by nearly all of the notable men of the north. However, Alexander misplaced his trust in James, for as soon as Alexander set foot in James's fortified tower at Iverness Castle, he was arrested. One by one the Highlanders were lured into the Council Chamber where upon they were arrested and confined. In total over 50 prominent Highlanders were placed in closed confinement, among them some of Alexander's closest allies and supporters. James released several Highlanders in with assurances that they would disperse their retinues, which they faithfully complied. The King now worked to press his own claim to Ross which had been cobbled together from the son of the late Earl of Buchan, Robert Stewart's, own claims.;x

To this end, he turned to Alexander's uncle and heir, John Mor. The King's messenger, James Campbell, was sent to meet with John Mor and offer him Kign James's terms. Mor was to usurp the Lordship from his nephew, Alexander. In return, James 'the fat' was to be neutralized while Mor would act as James's ally in the north. Mor, however, refused to negotiate until his nephew was released. Campbell was ordered to sieze Mor if Mor should resist James's offer. In the ensuing struggle, Mor was killed. News of Mor's death brough fresh outrage among Highlanders who now viewed James's promises of peace and just rule to be worthless. James attempted to distance himself from the whole affair and thus Campbell was executed. Nevertheless, the damage was done and the Highlander's rebelled.;x

Cromwell, lord protector of the English Commonwealth begged the Scottish Parliament to reconsider their religious position against Anglicanism, but at their refusal he found an excuse to invade the country. Within a year Scotland was conquered, its Parliament was abolished and the Scots were forced into an incorporating union with England. Scotland became an occupied country with Cromwellian citadels.

The will of Henry VIII declared that his daughter Elizabeth was to be succeeded by the descendants of his younger sister, Mary Tudor, Duchess of Suffolk, rather than by the Scottish descendants of his elder sister, Margaret Tudor. However, if the rules of male primogeniture were upheld and the successor James VI, King of Scots, would become the legitimate successor on the throne of England, there were other male alternative heirs but none of them pressed their claims. Still being in Scotland at that time, James VI was proclaimed King of England as James I a few hours after Elizabeth's death by a Council of Accession. Many Scots viewed the Union of the Crowns in 1603 as a disaster. It created the problem of one King ruling over two Parliaments.

Charles, who saw himself as the 'Godly Prince', sought to bring the Scots Kirk (the Church of Scotland) into conformity with England, effectively using his Scots bishops to run Scotland for him. That would alienate two powerful factions in Scottish society through his actions: the Presbyterians and the Scots nobilty. The situation precipitated in 1637 when Charles insisted, without consultation, on introducing an English-style prayerbook into Scotland. That incited a revolution and the National Covenant was signed the following year. It essentially demanded huge radical changes in Scotland's governance (a free Scottish Parliament, a free General Assembly and the abolition of royal appointment of bishops) effectively limiting the power of the King by inflating the role of Scotland's nobles and Kirk.;x

Angus's force was surrounded by a larger army of Angles and Saxons and fearing defeat, the King led prayers for deliverance. During the night Saint Andrew, who was martyred on a diagonal cross, appeared to Angus and assured him of victory. On the morrow a white saltire against the background of a blue sky appeared to both sides. The Picts and Scots were heartened by this, but the Angles lost confidence and were defeated. The King vowed that if he gained the victory, then Andrew would thereafter be the patron saint of Scotland and his cross the flag of Scotland. Angus did win and the Saltire duly became the national flag. It wasn't until the XVIth century that the plain white saltire on a blue field became established.;x

However, it was not a complete disaster for the whole of Scotland, as the defeat of the Jacobites was a good cause for celebration by most of the Scots people, expecially amongst the Lowland Presbyterians: the Union and the Scots Kirk were safe.

Although James II had recently deceased, his son James III, then only a boy, was to govern with the aid of a Regency council.

After a lengthy meeting at Lincluden, the two Queens came to an agreement. Scotland would loan Margaret money and men for Margarets campaign against the Yorkists. In return, Margaret agreed to surrender Berwick Castle, and promised an unguarded and rich southern England which the Scottish troops could plunder mercilessly.

EVENTHIST276020;Many Scots exiles who had fled the Stuart regime returned home with William from Holland, and a Scottish convention drafted the Claim of Right, which demanded a free Parliament and a Presbyterian Church. The exiled James VII ordered the convention to obey their rightful King, whilst the Scottish Parliament proclaimed William King of Scots and reclaimed their political power. Not all Scots accepted the new situation, there were supporters of the exiled Stuart dynasty, the 'Jacobites', which were assemblying forces in areas beyond government's control for the purpose of a counter-revolution. They believed that the natural order of Scottish society, with the rightful Stuart King at the top, was being destroyed by the Presbyterians. William of Orange wasn't particularly interested in Scotland as his life-long struggle was with Louis XIV of France and he relied on the money markets of London and Amsterdam to fund his war with the French. His invasion of England in 1688 was in many ways an indirect war effort against the French King. Scotland was either an irritation or a source of much needed troops to William. William of Orange left the governance of Scotland to his lieutenants, like Dalrymple of Stair, whose simple solution to the problem of the Jacobite Highlanders was to threaten and violently suppress the Clans into submission. Dalrymple decided to make an example of his political attitude in sending troops to Glencoe to exterminate the clan of MacDonald. That massacre shocked Scotland and provided much propaganda for the Jacobites, who published copies of the orders and conspired with greater urgency. The Scottish Parliament declared the whole affair an act of murder and Dalrymple was forced to abandon his office.;x

EVENTHIST276030;James was able to regain power, buying off members of Albany government, so that by the December 1482 Parliament Albany's government was collapsing. In particular his attempt to claim the vacant earldom of Mar led to the intervention of the powerful George Gordon, 2nd Earl of Huntly on the King's side. \nIn January 1483 Albany fled to his estates at Dunbar. The death of his patron, Edward IV of England, on 9 April, left Albany in a weak position, and he fled over the border to England.;x

EVENTNAME277006;The first Montenegrin law;x
EVENTHIST277006;In 1798 Petar I introduced the first laws in Montenegro - Zakonik Petra I. This law was further updated with five new paragraphs at the assembly in Stanjevici (1803). His rule prepared Montenegro for the subsequent introduction of modern institutions of the state: court (called Kuluk), taxes (60 para per household annually), schools and larger commercial enterprises. He also introduced his guards (25), so called 'Perjanici', who were chosen from the most prestigious tribes. Perjanici were first police (dzandarmerija) forces in Montenegro whose duty was to arrest those facing Kuluk. \nPetar's intention to implement the law and strengthen the central government was met with the resistance from the Montenegrin tribes who had always had considerable freedom and autonomy. Determined to impose the rule of law Petar asked his guards to kill two prominent opponents of the new law. These two were the tribal heads of Komani and Cevljani.;x

When Mihajlo was captured by the Ottomans, Stephan assumed power as Stephan V (the Blind).

EVENTHIST277011;Golubac was one of the strategically most important fortresses on Danube. It was of uncertain origins, either Hungarian or Serbian. Golubac was awared to Despot Stefan Lazarevic along with Belgrade when he swore vassalage to Sigismund. When Djuradj Brankovic returned the territories to Sigismund, Duke Jeremija, Serbian governor of the fortress, refused to turn it over to Hungarians unless he is paid a compensation.

He decided to undertake a rushed project of constructing the intimidating stronghold of Smederevo where he moved the capital of Serbia when Belgrade was returned to Hungary. The fortress was a smaller copy of Constantinople. With triangular base and 25 towers, it was the largest Serbian medieval citadel. Fortress of Smederevo was the peak of European medieval technology when it was constructed, but introduction of gunpowder artillery rendered it obsolete when the time came to defend against the final Ottoman invasion. Since this was a rushed project, people who worked on it lost much of their personal freedom and some were even driven to banditry.;x

Stefan, however, persued peaceful policy and tried to culturally and economically advance his Despotate instead of seeking expansion into lands his title gave him claim on.

Murad II demanded that Despot Djuradj joins his invasion Bosnia and Hungary and allows unhindered passage of Ottoman troops through Serbia. After failing in attempts to secure Serbia's neutrality in the war, Djuradj refused Sultan's demands and the Ottomans attacked. Only Smederevo and Novo Brdo managed to withstand the initial assault of Turksih troops, and Djuradj fled to Hungary to seek help from the new Emperor Albrecht. Hungary didn't have enough troops to defend its borders and help Serbia at the same time, and Hungarian nobility blocked any attempt by Emperor Albrecht to bring German troops as reinforcements.

His daughter's marriage with Ulrich II of Cilli, leader of Loyalist faction, already made his decision for him. Although Djuradj wasn't in a position to offer much active support to Ulrich's faction, Count of Cilli still maintained good relationships with his father-in-law. Unable to help his son-in-law and also unable to win King Wladyslaw's favor, Despot Djuradj turned to Republics of Venice and Ragusa for help, but both refused. His flight to Venice antagonized both Hungarians and Ottomans. King Wladyslaw seized Djuradj's estates in Hungary, while the Ottoman Sultan blinded his sons Grgur, who lead the Serbian unit in Ottoman army, and Stevan who was captured when Smederevo fell to Turks. However, King Wladyslaw came to understand the threat Ottomans represented and the small but significant aid the buffer Despotate of Serbia can provide. After spending some time fighting for the Venetians in Zeta, Despot Djuradj traveled back to Hungary to make peace and alliance against Ottomans with the new King. He succeeded, aided by their joint fear of Turks and help of Janko Hunyadi, a Wallachian noble and the leader of Nationalists who also served in the army of Stefan Lazarevic.;x

EVENTNAME277022;Crusade against the Turks;x
EVENTHIST277022;After King Wladyslaw managed to pacify the opposition in Hungary, he turned his attention to the Ottoman Empire. At the same time, this problem was brought more closely into the attention of other Christian powers. Knights of Saint John, remnants of the Byzantine Empire and Republic of Ragusa were the most active in demands for coordinated offensive against the Turks. The dynastic civil war in Ottoman Empire made these initiatives sound more realistic than before. Pope's first reaction was to send Cardinal Julian Cesarini to aid the pacification of Wladyslaw's opponents in Hungary. Between Cesarini's splendid efforts and Hunyadi's great military leadership, Hungary was more ready for war than ever. Hunyadi won his first crushing vicotory against an invading Ottoman army in Hungary in 1442, and already in 1443 he broke the 80000-strong Ottoman army in Wallachia. These victories and the news of Ottoman defeat against Karaman greatly emboldened the Christian monarchs. Just after Hunyadi's victory in Wallachia, the Pope decided to aid the war effort with a fifth of his annual income. In June 1443, an army of 25,000 with focus on cavalry headed south to attack the Ottomans in Serbia. The army was lead by King Wladyslaw himself and his most loyal vassals: Janos Hunyadi, Djuradj Brankovic and Dracul. Despot Djuradj lead his army of 8000 men which was strengthened by Petar Kovacevic, Duke of Srebrenica, and his 600 knights. In November, Janos Hunyadi lead the charge of 12000 Hungarian knights that completely broke the Ottoman army near Nis. Sofia fell to Christian forces in December. The winter stop the Christian invasion and tired Hungarian soldiers returned to their Kingdom in January 1444. Despot Djuradj opposed this retreat, but he could not force his opinion on the Hungarian King. Invasion resumed in June 1444, aided by a fleet made of Venetian and Papal galleys, with Burgundian fleet on its way. Before any battle could take place, peace talks took place. Peace of Szeged was signed in which Sultan Murad II agreed to restore the Despotate of Serbia as dual vassal, to pay a compensation to Hungary and to aid the Hungarian King with an army of 25,000 soldiers against his enemies during the next ten years. Despot Djuradj was the main advocate of peace talks on Christian side and only managed to persuade Wladyslaw to agree by bribing Janos Hunyadi with some of his estates in Hungary.;x

EVENTNAME277023;The Second Crusade;x
EVENTHIST277023;Peace of Szeged was very badly received by the Catholic world. For them, especially those who didn't take part in the war, the peace was an end of a glorious conquest and great success for Christianity. Blame for the peace was rightfully thrown on Despot Djuradj Brankovic. He was considered to have selfishly rushed to secure the liberation of his Despotate without consideration for the possible complete triumph of Christianity. Under pressure of other Catholic monarchs rallied around Cardinal Cesarini, who claimed that no treaty with a heathen may be valid, King Wladyslaw decided to break the Peace of Szeged and attack the Ottoman Empire again. Despot Djuradj, an old and tired man, decided to return to Serbia and honor the peace agreement with Ottomans.;x

Most well known of those ministers is the Ragusan noble Paskoje Sorkocevic (Pasqualis Junii de Sorgo), Head of Treasury for Despot Djuradj from 1445 to 1453. Aside from handling the treasury and economy of the small Despotate, Paskoje also aided the Despot in diplomacy.

EVENTNAME277025;The Third Crusade;x
EVENTHIST277025;Janos Hunyadi, the only leader of the Christian armies that survived the Battle of Varna, now hated the Turks with great passion. As soon as he was name the Guvernor of Hungary, he started preparing for another invasion of Turkish lands. Unlike King Wladyslaw, Janos Hunyadi failed to secure support of other Catholic monarchs and his vassals. The Pope refused to support Hunyadi's initiative until he settles his disputed with Emperor Friedrich III. Venice was too busy with their own problems both in the Balkans and in Italy, so they were more inclined to ally with Turks than to fight them. Aragonese King ignored Hunyadi's call for help completely. Relations between Despot Djuradj and Hungary were becoming colder even during the first crusade. Djuradj first opposed Wladyslaw's decision to withdraw, then talked him into signing the Peace of Szeged. In the second crusade, Despot Djuradj stayed neutral and now he was more inclined to change his policy and seek friendship of Ottomans.

EVENTNAME277028;Disaster at Kosovo;x
EVENTHIST277028;Hunyadi had an army of 70000, mostly cavalry, and met an even larger Turkish army lead by the Sultan himself. Thanks to unconnected betrayals of Djuradj Brankovic of Serbia and Dan of Wallachia, Hungarian army was dispersed and 17000 knights lost their lives. Despot Djuradj ordered all fleeing Hungarians to be allowed to pass through Serbia except Janos Hunyadi who was arrested and thrown into dungeon. This was Djuradj's revenge for Hunyadi's devastation of Serbia, but also a move influenced by his Head of Treasury, Paskoje Sorkocevic. Hungarian nobles met to discuss how to liberate Hunyadi. They decided to pledge to protect Serbia against all her enemies, never to order their armies to pass through Serbia unless allowed to do so by Serbian Despot, to pay 100000 ducats of compensation and to return to Djuradj all his estates in Hungary except those that will be given to Hunyadi as dowry of Djuradj's granddaughter Jelisaveta, daughter of late Ulrich II of Cilli, who was to marry one of Hunyadi's sons. Hunyadi's son was to stay in Smederevo as Djuradj's hostage until Hungary fulfills all its promises. Despite this favorable treaty, this move of Despot Djuradj finally broke Serbia's relationships with possible Catholic allies and forced him to seek to appease Ottoman Sultan while cooperating with remnants of Byzantine Empire.;x

As he had no children, the logical choice of his hair was his nephew, Djuradj Brankovic, his close aide and successful general. Despot Stefan announced his decision at the council of Serbian nobles in Srebrenica and met no resistance. However, he still needed Emperor Sisgismund's blessing for this non-direct inheritance. In May 1426, a treaty was signed between Stefan and Sigismund in Hungarian town of Tata according to which Emperor Sigismund would recognize Djuradj as Stefan's heir but Djuradj would have to return the town of Belgrade and surrounding territories, including the fortress of Golubac, to Hungary upon Stefan's death. Emperor Sigismund was also named heir to Serbian Despotate in case of Djuradj's death without heirs.

Internal conflicts of Hungary and actions of disloyal Lord of Belgrade against Despot Djuradj only strenghtened Turkophilic nobles in Serbia. Sultan Memhed II, aware of this change and with most of Serbia under his control, offered Despot Djuradj to let him rule a smaller despotate but with reduced tribute. Despot initially agreed, but changed his mind as Ottoman army was crossing Serbia to attack Belgrade. After suffering great losses in defense of Smederevo and Belgrade and even more to the plague that came afterwards and also took life of Janos Hunyadi, Despot Djuradj was forced to negotiate and new peace and vassalage with Ottoman Empire. He was stopped by death in 1456.;x

EVENTHIST277040;Milo Obrenovic was a different kind of rebel leader than Karadjordje. While Karadjordje pursued total war until ultimate liberation of Serbia, Milo Obrenovic was more political. A veteran of the First Uprising under Karadjordje, Milo realized that Serbia has no hope of withstanding the full assault of Ottoman military. As soon as the tide of war started to turn against him, Milo negotiated a peace with the Ottomans granting Serbia an autonomy within the Empire. On July 24th 1817, Milo Obrenovic order assassination of Karadjordje, solidifying his rule in Serbia and improving relations with the Ottoman Empire with one move. This started a blood feud between the newly formed noble houses of Karadjordjevic and Obrenovic which lasted until the extinction of the latter.;x

Without ever taking formal control, Petrucci ruled the city with an iron fist. However he brought good government to Siena and ended the constant feuding between factions.

EVENTNAME257002;Il Valentino's proposal;x
EVENTHIST257002;In conquering Milan, King Louis XII of France helped Cesare Borgia, Pope Alexander VI's son, to carve himself a principality in Romagna and Marche. In November 1499 Cesare Borgia, also known as 'il Valentino' because of his ducal title, started his adventure in Romagna and Marche, territories belonging to the Papal States only nominally and where the fiefs of Rimini, Pesaro, Imola, Faenza, Forli, Urbino and Camerino were declared forfeited with a Papal bull because they didn't pay the census to the Church. Imola and Faenza were his first conquests then he took Cesena but he had to suspend the military operations because of il Moro's restoration in Milan. He used the ceasefire to pay a visit in Rome for the Holy Year and to be appointed Gonfaloniere of the Church by his father. By the end of the year, Borgia resumed his military campaign and the following year, in 1501, with the conquests of Pesaro, Rimini and Faenza, he took control of Romagna, for which he obtained the ducal investiture by Pope Alexander VI. Cesare Borgia's greed wasn't yet satisfied, he also wanted to submit Bologna and Florence but since these asked Louis XII's military protection, he diverted to the other minor principalities in Tuscany, Umbria and Marches, where he managed to easily submit the signoria of Piombino, the duchies of Urbino and Camerino and the cities in Umbria. Then Borgia moved to Siena to offer his protection to the city with the promise to chase away the tyrannical Petrucci who in the meanwhile took refuge in Lucca. But the city of Siena, alarmed by Borgia's thirst of power, preferred to confirm Petrucci as 'Signore' and to look for French military protection. In 1503, Cesare's father (Pope Alexander VI) died and with him also the Duchy with which he was invested fell apart: Romagna went into chaos and Venice saw the opportunity to take control over there while the other principalities welcomed back their former 'signorie'. Still hoping to be of any help for the expansionist plans of the new elected Pope Julius II (formerly a sworn enemy of the Borgia family), he was arrested instead and sent to Spain.;x

The Emperor, in return, granted the Republican liberty of the Sienese state and confirmed her magistrates. He also abandoned the project to build a new fortress offering a garrison at his expenses and conceded the general pardon to the citizenship. The Sienese republic would remain under imperial protection until 1557, when Felipe II King of Spain assigned the administration of the Sienese territory to Duke Cosimo I de' Medici with the exception of the Sienese coastal cities which constituted the Spanish State of Presidi.

Their religious leaders were the diviners and sorcerors of Songhai's traditional religions but because he was a Songhai prince he was nominally Muslim and gave money to the mosques of Gao. He began his reign by defeating the Dogon and Fulani tribes that were rivals to the Songhai, then drove the Mossi raiders out of the Dendi for good. A brilliant general, in 26 years he fought 32 wars and won them all. Soon, he began to look beyond Gao. The obvious choice was Timbuktu, long the key to control of the valuable gold-salt-ivory trade of West Africa.

Although Mali was on the decline, it would remain a threat to Songhai independence while it remained so close to Gao. Timbuktu was the key to control of West Africa, and Sonni Ali meant to have that key. Knowing this, the Tuareg approached him with an offer. They had founded Timbuktu but were unable to hold onto it. They were eager to take revenge on the Malinke and soon a strike force was assembled to take Timbuktu. It was a risky gambit against a powerful empire, but it was Gao's last chance for empire.;x

Sonni Ali had Gao and Timbuktu lay close by to the west. Although it was held by others, it was a tempting target indeed. If he could lay claim to it, he could build an empire akin to that of Mali - and bring the Malinke Kings down from their thrones. Sonni Ali decided to gamble for it all.;x

He had marked the ulemas (clerics) of Timbuktu as traitors and cowards who deserved no mercy. When he occupied Timbuktu he set his men loose on the city, sacking the city and slaughtering its Muslim leaders, many of whom fled to Walata.

Most of the cavalry were made up of nobility, but slaves and captives were accepted as well. He also installed a hi-koi (commander-in-chief) for the navy, which grew to over four hundred boats run by the Sorko, the fisherfolk of the Dendi. The Sorko were key to his victories along the Niger, able to transport troops quickly along the more than thousand-mile 'highway'. Using the Sorko, he struck quickly along the river at Walata and Jenne, cities that had recently gained their independence from Mali. If Jenne fell, the empire would be unstoppable.;x

Taking advantage of the high water season Sonni Ali sent his army to Jenne on 400 boats, but the siege took seven years, seven months and seven days. When Jenne at last fell the Malinke King surrendered with dignity. Out of respect to the defeated leader, Sonni Ali instructed his men not to loot the city or harm the royal family.

He organized the Songhai government into an effective bureaucracy, turning conquered states into provinces, appointing governors and setting standards.

Although he tried to accomodate the Muslims Sonni Ali had had little respect for Islam. He kept up the outward appearance of a Muslim but he neither relinquished the traditional Songhai religion nor recognized Islam as the state religion. Women were allowed to walk around unveiled and public ceremonies were a mix of traditional and islamic rituals. His harsh treatment of the ulemas (clerics) of Timbuktu only created more friction in the empire. Ali was succeeded by his son Sonni Baru. Like his father, Baru was Muslim in name only. He said his prayers all at once instead of five times a day and on campaign he simply said the names of the prayers to save time. Finally a group of Muslim officers confronted Baru and demanded he change his ways. He refused only to be faced with a coup d'etat.

His support came from the overwhelming numbers of rural farmers, fishers and hunters that still led traditional lifestyles outside the cities, but the new territories in the west were predominantly Muslim and the balance of power continued to shift. Although he continued to resist the idea of forcing religion on any man and never became a devout Muslim himself, Sonni Beru did finally declare Islam to be the state religion of Songhai.;x

A devout Muslim and a skilled general, within three years of his coup d'etat he had solidified his position enough to leave Songhai for two years to make a special pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina, or 'Hajj'. This pilgrimage was not only required of the pious, it also gave them a special blessing called 'baraka'. Although not as large as Mansa Musa's hajj a century earlier, Askia Mohammad's pilgrimage was still a spectacle.

His hajj had strengthened his beliefs and given him spiritual authority over Sahel, all the fertile land south of the Sahara.

To prevent this the King created a new position: the Kurmina-Fari, or overlord of the west, based in Kabara, a port west of Timbuktu. The Kurmina-Fari became the second most powerful man in the empire after the King himself and the position was a prize given to royal brothers to keep them out of trouble.

Flush with success, Askia Mohammad sent his armies east against Hausaland.;x

EVENTNAME284026;The Fall of Kano;x
EVENTHIST284026;The Jihad against the Hausa states was a success. All the Hausa cities were captured except the walled city of Kano, which resisted for over a year. When it finally surrendered Askia Mohammad allowed the King of Kano to keep his throne and married one of his daughters to him. Hausaland was now part of Songhai.;x

EVENTNAME284027;The Greatest Empire in the Sahel;x
EVENTHIST284027;With the fall of Hausaland the emperor had expanded as far south and as far west as the empire could bear. But there were still lands for the taking. To the north were the valuable salt mines of Taghaza in the Sahara desert, while to the east were the Tuareg lands of Air and Agades. The emperor moved northeast, driving the Tuaregs into the desert and setting up administrators to prevent them from reclaiming these lost lands. With these additions the Songhai empire had at last reached its zenith, ultimately stretching from Taghaza in the north to the borders of Yatenga in the south, and from Air in the northeast to Futa Toro in Senegambia. With literally several hundred cultures under its control, Songhai was the largest empire in African history. Unfortuantely, once one has reached the top, there is only one way to go...;x

EVENTNAME284028;Timbuktu's Cultural Revival;x
EVENTHIST284028;The King decidedly courted his Muslim subjects, particularly in Timbuktu, where the clerics and scholars who had fled from Sonni Ali had returned. The Muslims were the literate class of Songhai, and the King encouraged literacy, art and learning. Under the King's patronage Timbuktu experienced a cultural revival and flourished as a center of learning. He gave grants of land and incomes to the ulema, attracting eminent Muslim scholars from as far away as India. The emperor often sought out the ulema for advice and treated them as his equals. The University of Sankore produced distinguished scholars and published significant books, including Tarik al-Fattah and Tarik as-Sudan, two of the few histories of Africa known to exist in the Middle Ages.;x

EVENTNAME284029;Askia Mohammad's Reforms;x
EVENTHIST284029;In Cairo, Askia Mohammad had consulted with scholars and examined legal and administrative methods and returned with many new ideas. Mohammad fostered trade and commerce, policing the trade routes with the army to maintain its safety. He standardized weights, measures and currency, encouraging the idea of one empire instead of dozens of cultures. He created a large and elaborate bureaucracy to oversee the empire, dividing Songhai into defined provinces, each with its own governor. The King was at the center of it all, assisted by a council of advisors and ministers. Askia was also using the reforms to systematically remove the surviving members of the Sonni, Dia and Za dynasties, replacing them with his own followers. The new government was a giant step away from the style of Mali or Ghana and also from Islamic models used in North Africa. Nothing like it had ever existed in the Sahel before.;x

EVENTNAME284030;The Obligations of Princes;x
EVENTHIST284030;While the urban centers of Songhai were dominated by Islam, the rural areas where the vast majority of the population lived followed traditional African religions. Askia Mohammad was a fervent Muslim, and throughout his life he attempted to convert his people peacefully. He introduced Islamic law and appointed Islamic judges (Qadhis) in the larger districts and replaced native Songhai administrators with Arabs in order to Islamicize the empire but he stopped short of making Islam mandatory. He turned to a famous Islamic scholar, Muhammad Al-Maghili, for advice. In response, Al-Maghili wrote a book entitled 'The Obligations of Princes' in which he advised the King to put to death all those who claimed knowledge of the supernatural, punish men and women who mixed freely on the street and follow the teachings of the Koran regarding hygiene and diet. This strict interpretation of Islamic law was hard for the King to accept. He instituted some changes but never went as far as Al-Maghili wanted him to.;x

#;x
EVENTNAME284031;The Abdication;x
EVENTHIST284031;By the time Mohammad was seventy he had weakened considerably and his sight was almost gone. His sons began to demand that he give up power and the royal court became an increasingly dangerous place for the emperor. To prevent others from realizing how weak the old King was the hou-kokorai-koi (master of the royal household) Ali Fulan refused to allow others to see him. This only enraged the sons and one of them, Musa, threatened to kill Ali Fulan. Fearing for his life he left the palace in 1527, and the next year Musa announced at prayers that his father had stepped down in favor of Musa. Old, blind, and without any allies the aged Mohammad was left with no choice but to abdicate. This began a long war of succession where Musa became Askia but had to fight his brothers for the title. He killed some in battle while others fled Songhai to other realms. Those who remained in Gao disappeared one by one until Musa was finally killed in battle by the remaining brothers.;x
ACTIONNAME284031A;I have no choice;x
#;x
EVENTNAME284032;The Succession;x
EVENTHIST284032;When Askia Musa was killed the eldest remaining son was the Kurmina-Fari (Governor of the West) and most of the brothers assumed he would inherit the throne. Instead, a cousin named Muhammad Bunkan seized the throne before the eldest brother could arrive. Since there were no clear laws of succession in Songhai, he faced little opposition to his rule, so faced with the fait accompli, the brothers reluctantly agreed that Muhammad would be King. Although Muhammad II introduced elaborate music, costumes and art into the royal court, he is mostly remembered for his unpopular wars.;x
ACTIONNAME284032A;Muhammad Bunkan seizes the throne;x
ACTIONNAME284032B;The eldest shall inherit;x
#;x
EVENTNAME284033;Ismail and the King;x
EVENTHIST284033;Mohammad Bunkan was a powerful man with few friends. When he learned a childhood friend, Ismail, was alive but in hiding, he coaxed him back to Gao by offering his daughter to him. Even so it was hard for the emperor to trust his friend because he was one of Askia Mohammad's sons, so he made Ismail swear he would never betray his new father-in-law. Soon after his arrival Ismail grew to hate his old friend. Ismail's sisters were publicly humiliated by being forced to show their faces at court while the old King had been horribly mistreated, confined to a tiny, insect-filled island in the Niger river. When Ismail met his father, Askia Mohammad convinced his son that Mohammad Bunkan had to be overthrown. Working with powerful friends of his father, Ismail broke his word and deposed Mohammad II in 1437. Mohammad fled to a life of exile in Mali while Ismail took the throne. In gratitude Askia Mohammad gave his son his caliph's robes. He died the following year, old and blind - but proud.;x
ACTIONNAME284033A;Break the promise;x
ACTIONNAME284033B;Remain faithful to my old friend;x
#;x
EVENTNAME284034;The Election of the King;x
EVENTHIST284034;Songhai had no clear laws of succession, a fact which had caused problems over the generations. When the King died of natural causes in 1539 the leading men of Songhai peacefully elected the next King. They chose Ishaq, a son of Muhammad I.;x
ACTIONNAME284034A;Ishaq shall be King;x
ACTIONNAME284034B;Refuse to accept their authority;x
#;x
EVENTNAME284035;Ishaq's Folly;x
EVENTHIST284035;Ishaq proved to be a poor King. Even though he was a devout Muslim he regularly sent agents to Timbuktu to demand tribute from the merchants there. This hurt the economy and made him many enemies. Eventually he began to see conspiracies around every corner and executed or dismissed anyone he suspected of plotting against him no matter how high their rank. As this reign of terror continued the conspiracies became very much real.;x
ACTIONNAME284035A;They're all against me!;x
#;x
EVENTNAME284036;The Death of the King;x
EVENTHIST284036;As the King lay near death, friends of the Kurmina-Fari called him to the capital to make sure he became the next King. Daoud was the third Kurmina-Fari of the King's reign, the other two having been executed. As a new election drew near the favorite was Bokar, a handsome prince who traced his lineage through one of Askia Mohammad's daughters. He posed a grave threat to Daoud's chances so the Kurmina-Fari had him killed - according to legend by magic. With his competition gone Daoud became the next monarch.;x
ACTIONNAME284036A;Murder Bokar to ensure our rule;x
ACTIONNAME284036B;Bokar wins a fair election;x
#;x
EVENTNAME284037;Treason and Conspiracy;x
EVENTHIST284037;When the King died after a long and relatively peaceful reign one of his sons, al-Hajj, took the the throne. He was deposed by his brothers in 1536, replaced by Muhammad Bani, another son of Daoud. Muhammad Bani was not a popular ruler and the other brothers conspired against him until their plot was revealed. Taking advantage of the situation several Songhai vassals declared their independence and stopped paying tribute. First Hausaland, then the Ougadougou, then the Maghreb of the western gold fields. Muhammad Bani was too distracted to deal with them properly, and soon the fringes of the empire began to unravel.;x
ACTIONNAME284037A;Their treachery shall be repaid in blood!;x
#;x
EVENTNAME284038;Civil War in Songhai;x
EVENTHIST284038;Early in Muhammad Bani's reign tensions between two powerful men led to murder. Kabara was Timbuktu's port, immensely important to trade along the Niger. Its governor, chief Alu, had arrested one of the men of the Kurmina-Fari, Governor of the West. The Kurmina-Fari was Muhammad Sadiq, brother of the emperor. He killed Chief Alu in a fit of rage, then realized it would be seen as treason back home. Deciding to strike first he joined his army with another brother's and marched on Gao. In response Muhammad Bani raised an army against them, dying the day they left the city. Songhai was divided into Western and Eastern camps based in Timbuktu and Gao respectively. Finally, the rebels were defeated, and the new King Ishaq II hunted down and killed Muhammad Sadiq and imprisoned many of the officers of the west. The war was over, but at great cost.;x

EVENTNAME284039;The Pretender's Demands;x
EVENTHIST284039;In 1590 Ishaq II received a letter from the Sultan of Morocco demanding the Songhai emperor surrender his throne to his brother, who the Sultan was giving protection to. The Songhai emperor ignored the Sultan's demands and began an expedition to the far west of the empire to deal with the rebellious Mahgrebs.;x

EVENTNAME284040;The Moroccan Invasion;x
EVENTHIST284040;Desiring the riches of the Sudan, Morocco invaded Songhai in 1590. The emperor was in the west fighting the Mahgrebs and refused to believe Morocco was marching against him. When the Moroccans arrived he had to rush home to raise an army. The King ordered the salt mines of Taghaz to be abandoned and when the Sultan's forces arrived there he found them deserted. The Sultan abandoned them as well, ending nine centuries of salt mining in the Sahara. The Kurmina-Fari, Muhammad Gao, advised filling in the desert wells the Moroccans would have to stop at, but the troops sent to do so were ambushed by Tuareg nomads and the Moroccans arrived safe and sound past the Sahara. If the Songhai forces had attacked then they would have easily beaten the exhausted army, but the Songhai force was still disorganized. As wars went this one was starting badly.;x
#;x
EVENTNAME284041;The Battle of Tondibi;x
EVENTHIST284041;The decisive battle of the war took place at Tondibi, about 35 miles north of Gao along the Niger. Although the Songhai army outnumbered the invaders they were no match for the guns and cannons of the Moroccans. Among the 4,600 members of the expeditionary force were 500 captured Portuguese arquebusiers and 10 cannons. The twenty to forty thousand Songhai had only spears and arrows and were at a disadvantage. Things took a turn for the worse when an advisor led the King off the field early, sparking a general retreat. As they fled across the river brave Songhai warriors tied themselves together and shot arrows at the advancing Moroccans, but the battle was lost. Now nothing stood between the enemy and the capital so Ishaq II retreated to the countryside with what was left of his army. The empire began to splinter into small states warring with each other as much as the invaders.;x
ACTIONNAME284041A;This is the end!;x
#;x
EVENTNAME284042;Songhai's Surrender;x
EVENTHIST284042;Faced with certain defeat the King offered to pay tribute to Morocco, hoping this would satisfy them. He scraped together 100,000 pieces of gold and one thousand slaves and sent a message to the enemy commander, Judar Pasha, who in turn sent it to the Sultan.;x

EVENTNAME284044;The Murder of the King;x
EVENTHIST284044;With the trade cities gone the Songhai cavalry retreated into the countryside where they deposed the emperor. In his place they named Muhammad Gao, the Kurmina-Fari, as the new Askia.;x
ACTIONNAME284044A;Muhammad Gao can lead us!;x
#;x
EVENTNAME284045;Mansur Pasha's Deception;x
EVENTHIST284045;Muhammad Gao was a wily general whose advice had gone unheeded by the previous King. As military ruler of the Songhai he led the fight against the invaders. The enemy commander, Mansur Pasha, set a trap for the Askia. Upon arriving in Songhai Mansur arranged a meeting with his counterpart to discuss peace. Muhammad Gao unwisely accepted and was assassinated. Songhai forces rallied under the leadership of Askia Nuh, who held out against the Moroccan army for years.;x

EVENTNAME284048;Songhai Resistance;x
EVENTHIST284048;With the loss of the empire, the Songhai retreated to their ancestral homeland of Dendi, a mosquito-infested swamp that nobody cared to invade. In Dendi the reign of the Askias continued as they led a resistance against the invaders. Songhai would never become great again, but it would survive.;x

EVENTNAME284051;Askia Mohammad falls ill;x
EVENTHIST284051;In the last years of his reign Askia Mohammad became ill. As his illness forced him into retirement from public life his military campaigns came to an end. Although he could no longer lead his armies from horseback, Mohammad continued to be a forceful presence in his government. The aging King and his ministers conspired to keep the extent of his problems away from the court, but as time passed it became more and more obvious that something was wrong.;x

He sent a letter to the VOC's Governor of Taiwan in August 1655. The Spanish, wrote Chenggong, had been mistreating his sailors, and he had therefore issued an edict that forbade Chinese to sail to Manila on pain of death. He enclosed a copy of the edict and requested that the Governor propagate it in Formosa and enforce it by confiscating the junks and property of any who disobeyed. But the language of the edict raised the hackles of the VOC. First, it said that the Dutch ''behave more like animals than Christians.'' Second, it referred to Chinese who lived in the Dutch colony as Chenggong's subjects. Third, and most important, it threatened punishment not only for Chinese but also for ''anyone outside of our nation who extends money for trade with Manila.'' If company officials did as Chenggong asked and published the edict, they would be admitting that Chenggong had sovereignty over the Chinese colonists in Formosa.

He started by confiscating Muslim books and promoting the semi-forced conversion of a subgroup of Muslims, the Helches, descendants of Christians that had been Islamized for generations. By Christmas 1499, the Muslims rebelled in the city and the rebellion quickly spread throughout the province. When the rebellion was put down in 1501, the Kings had the excuse to break the peace agreements and declared the forced conversion of all the Mudejars in their Kingdom or exile.

Anton Fugger (1525-1560) had trading concessions in Chile, Peru and Moscow. However, the company declined by the end of the 16th Century because of state bankruptcies in Spain, family conflicts and lack of interest on the part of the heirs. Financial support from Jakob Fugger allowed young Carlos to win the Imperial crown over a more prestigious François Ier, something that the King of France never forgave him. However the rents of Castile were mortgaged for several years to pay back the 850,000 florins loaned by the Fuggers at high interest, and the added taxation greatly increased the unhappiness of the Castilians with their foreign King.;x

The nobility continued to erode the cities position during the regency of Cisneros in 1516, so the commons were upset with Carlos delay to come to his realm. When 17 year old Carlos arrived from Burgundy, he illegally took the crown from his mad mother without much opposition, but he also behaved as a foreign King in a conquered country, appointing only Burgundians for government and extorting money from the cities, thus alienating both the nobles and the commons. When the chance to claim the imperial crown presented, Carlos extorted and mortgaged Castile rents to pay the Fuggers before leaving for Germany. The Castilian cities then revolted and formed the Santa Junta, defeating the scarce Royal forces, while the nobility stood aside unwilling to defend a King that had ignored their demands regarding court appointments. The rebels appealed to Juana the mad for support, but she was unwilling or unable to help them.

EVENTHIST3157;On the twenty-fifth day of October, 1555, the estates of the Netherlands were assembled in the great hall of the palace at Brussels. They had been summoned to be witnesses and the guarantees of the abdication, which Charles V had long before resolved upon, and which he was that day to execute. Charles was a devotee catholic and compassionate with other people, but he could not see why anyone would not come back to the only church there was, the Catholic Church. The incessant strife, both religious and political, within the Holy Roman Empire had worn him down. Therefore he wanted to split the Habsburg Empire between Madrid and Vienna and then withdraw to the calm milieu of his favorite cloister. Let the rash and youthful take care of the problems!;x

It was impossible for the Spanish minister of finance to forecast any repayments as all costs fluctuated volatile.

EVENTNAME3160;The Purge of the Morisques;x
EVENTHIST3160;By the mid-16th Century the Morisque population in the former Kingdom of Granada was increasing faster than the Christian population. Coupled with their failure to integrate into the greater Christian society and their nominal allegiance to Christianity they were seen as a threat by the Spanish authorities to the integrity of Christian Spain itself. Their less than covert aid to Muslim raiders and pirates off the coast of Spain only reinforced the fears of the authorities who were already greatly concerned over the rising power of the Muslim Ottoman Turks. Under the leadership of Suleiman the Magnificent the Turks were asserting control over the entire Eastern Mediterranean and threatened Italy and Sicily as well.\n \n For their part the Morisques felt threatened by ever-mounting taxes on the silk trade that furnished the basis for their livelihoods and Spanish challenges to their land titles. They tried to negotiate with the King to resolve their differences, but Felipe II would have nothing to do with their proposals. They responded by revolting on Christmas Eve, 1568. They had a number of early successes, aided by the lack of Spanish troops who'd recently been sent to reinforce the Duke of Alba's forces in the Netherlands as well as aid from their co-religionists in North Africa, but they were eventually overwhelmed by forces led by Don Juan de Austria, half-brother of Felipe II. As punishment the King decreed that they be deported to other provinces of Castile in order to break up the cohesive communities that reinforced their isolation from Christian society. Christian colonists were recruited from Castile to replace the Morisques, although this policy proved to be less than completely successful.;x

EVENTHIST3163;In 1580, a regency council convened in Portugal to settle the succession. With the death of Sebastião I, Portugal was left with no clear heir. In 1580, several people had claims to the throne: Felipe II of Spain, son of D. Isabel (daugther of D. Manuel I) who had a large support of the nobles but lacked peasant support, D. Antonio, despised by the nobles because he was an ilegitimate son of D. Luis (son of D. Manuel I) but had great support from the lower classes, and finally, D. Catarina, the Duchess of Bragança. She was the legitimate daughter of D. Duarte (son of D. Manuel I). Although Catarina's claim was the strongest, the Portuguese were not happy with the idea of an independent Queen.

On the day that the 12 Year Truce was signed with the Dutch in 1609 he issued the order for the expulsion. It took some time to gather the necessary resources, but they began later that year. The order fell hardest on Aragon, Valencia and Murcia because they had large numbers of unassimilated Morisques from the earlier stages of the Reconquista. Valencia lost almost a third of its population and Aragon almost a fifth. But Felipe III and his advisors thought this was a cheap price to pay for cleansing Spain of its hated minority and to reassert the power and prestige of the Crown, both badly damaged by its defeats by the Protestant heretics.;x

Those several alliances were set up to restore the Bourbons to the French Throne, crush the revolution and get Europe back to normal again. This succeeded in 1814 and again in 1815 when foreign armies brought Louis XVIII on the throne. Louis XVIII was the brother of the Executed King Louis of France and in early life was known as the Comte de Provence. He remained in Paris after the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789 but escaped to Belgium two years later. After King Louis' execution in 1793 he proclaimed himself regent, and after the death of his brother's heir in 1795, he took the title Louis XVIII. He lived as an exile in various European countries until he became King after Napoléon's first abdication in 1814. On Napoléon's return to power in 1815, however, Louis again fled to Belgium;x

In 1552, as they marched on Siena the people revolted and threw out the Spanish troops, and an independent Siena took up a pro-French policy. Henri II, King of France, tried to exploit the situation by sending there an army led by Paul de Termes, who was successively substituted by Strozzi when an invasion of Corsica was attempted with the help of the Turkish fleet.

EVENTNAME24005;Western route to India;x
EVENTHIST24005;In 1486 a Genoese named Cristoforo Colombo offered his plan for finding a Western route to India to the Kings of Spain. His offer had been previously rejected by Portugal because they were following the Eastern route, and because it was fundamentally flawed. Columbus was basing his plan in the mistaken Ptolemaic and Biblic theories of Pierre D'Ailly and Paolo Toscanelli that considered the circumference of the Earth a lot smaller that it really is. Although it was difficult to find good geographers in Castile, the Spanish commission also rightly concluded that the plan was inviable, probably because the right measurement of the Earth's circumference had already been calculated by Erathostenes, and by Muslim astronomers, and this knowledge was known at the time. The outrageous demands of the sailor probably did not help him either. However, since Columbus had already gained some important supporters, Queen Isabel between them, the commission left the door open to a reconsideration after the war of Granada, and allocated some funds for Columbus.;x

EVENTHIST24006;Cristoforo Colombo submitted his plan for finding a Western route to India a second time in 1491. He was made to wait until the fall of Granada, but then the commission failed against his plan for a second time. However Columbus had impressed favourably several counselors of both Isabel and Fernando, and they lobbied in his favor. The main argument was that even if the risk was high, the investment was small and the potential benefits enormous, both in terms of money and in terms of souls that could be saved by Christianity. Isabel was very sensitive to this last argument and agreed to finance the expedition. The monarchs agreed to the exorbitant terms Columbus demanded: he would be knighted if he were to succeed on his first voyage, appointed Admiral of the Seas, made Viceroy of all the new lands, and on top of that awarded 10 percent of any new wealth. After 10 years of pursuing his dream he would accept nothing less, and after all, the enterprise was considered unlikely to produce much. The expedition was not expensive to finance, and the Queen did not need to sell any of her jewels. It is interesting to think that the most important geographical discovery of mankind was serendipitous. It came out of a grant application that was rejected by a scientific commission based on solid evidence that it was flawed and ignored relevant accepted bibliography supporting the opposite rightful theory, that India could not be reached by sailing Westward across an empty sea with available naval technology, but whose decision was overruled due to favoritism by influential politicians. Columbus will always defend against all evidence that he had reached Asia and not a New World. Awful administrator, he was, however, one of the greatest sailors of all times.;x

EVENTNAME285001;Treaty of Alcacovas;x
EVENTHIST285001;In 1469 Alfonso V of Portugal was presented with the opportunity of becoming the King of Castile when he and his brother-in-law Enrique IV of Castile agreed on his marriage to Isabel, Princess of Asturias (heir title). But the deal failed when Isabel married Fernando of Aragon. When Enrique died and Isabel proclaimed herself Queen, in 1475, he saw his chance disappearing and decided to play hard. In a month he was married to his niece, Juana, and had claimed the crown of Castile for himself, invading the country. The plan was good because Juana had also the support of France and a great part of the Castilian nobility who rebelled in her support. Despite the simultaneous invasion from France and Portugal, and the rebellion of the nobles in the West of Castile, the war did not go well. The French were stopped by the Basques, while Fernando, with troops mostly from Castile and Asturias, inflicted a crushing defeat to the Portuguese in Toro in 1476. Alfonso traveled to France to try to get a stronger involvement from Louis XI, but the French had lost interest. By then Fernando had recovered control of all the Northwest. The war at sea, that extended as far as the coast of Guinea, claimed by Castile, was also favorable to Isabel. Alfonso's marriage to his niece was not recognized by the Pope, and a last invasion at the South ended also in defeat at la Albuera in February, 1479. With the nobility subdued and the Portuguese defeated, Castile had now the upper hand, but Isabel was half Portuguese herself, and Portuguese was her first language. She desired a perpetual peace with Portugal, with long lasting friendship and perhaps a dynastic union in the future, like the one with Aragon, and she was prepared to be generous with the defeated to obtain it. The treaty of Alcacovas, was concluded in September 4, 1479. It had four parts, all of them historically important. In the first part, Isabel and Fernando were recognized as rightful Kings of Castile and Leon, and Alfonso was recognized as rightful King of Portugal. In the second part, Juana renounced to her claim to the crown of Castile and was forced to expend the rest of her life in a convent in Portugal. In the third part, the future marriage between the infant Alfonso, son of Joao and the infant Isabel, daughter of the Catholic Kings was arranged. And in the fourth part, Castile accepted the claim of Portugal over Guinea, and the Atlantic coast of Africa, Madeira, Azores and Cape Verde, and any future discoveries South of the Canary Islands toward Guinea. Portugal accepted the claim of Castile over the Canary Islands. The treaty of Alcacovas is very important because it created a long lasting peace between Portugal and Spain, and set the basis for future diplomatic resolution of conflicts, like the discovery of the New World and the treaty of Tordesillas. Some believe it was crucial to the discovery of the New World by Spain, as Africa was reserved for Portugal, leaving only the unknown West for Spain.;x

EVENTHIST285020;The revolt of the 'comuneros' of Paraguay in 1718 was a reaction of creoles and spaniards against the governor of Asunción, who supported the jesuit missions. These Jesuit missions were accused by creoles and spaniards of holding the best lands and of reducing manpower because of the reduced labour hours they imposed on the natives. In real history the revolt lasted until 1735, when a native army under the command of the Jesuits defeated the 'comuneros'.;x

EVENTHIST285024;The demand for a representation of the Creoles in the administration, besides the governments need for income, was solved by the sale of public offices. Since 1630, inhabitants of the colonies had the possibility to obtain positions by money. The crown began to sell positions in the treasury in 1622, in the corregimientos in 1678 and in courts in 1687. Many Creoles took these opportunities. The purchase of an office gained them a certain influence and independence within the administration. For the crown, it meant additional income, but also less authority in the colonies.;x

EVENTHIST285025;When in 1687 the Crown began to sell positions in the courts, the Creoles did not miss the opportunity. Slowly, they started to consider the districts of their 'audiencia' as their homeland and to affirm that, considering their aptidude for the office, they were supposed to occupy all offices within their districts. By 1750 many audiencias were already almost completely dominated by the local Creole elites, especially in Lima, Charcas and Quito. Although they did not yet even think of seceding from the Empire, this situation contributed in the creation and enhancement of a certain local identity and determined the later centres of the wars of independence.;x

EVENTHIST285028;After the secession of the thirteen English colonies in North America and several revolts in the Spanish colonies, the Court was particularly worried about the situation in the colonies. In 1783 the count of Aranda, Secretary of the King of Spain, proposed a bold plan: turning the colonial viceroyalties into independent vassal Kingdoms of Spain ruled by members of the Spanish royal family. The King would have become King of Spain and Emperor of 'India'. The suggested new Kingdoms were: Mexico (the viceroyalty of New Spain), Tierra Firme (viceroyalty of New Granada) and Perú (viceroyalty of Perú and La Plata). In fact the project was never realised, and less than 20 years later the definite secession of Spain's American colonies began.;x

EVENTNAME285041;The Castilian protectorate of Navarre;x
EVENTHIST285041;The ascension of Fernando to the throne of Castile radically changed the situation in Navarre. Castile had always supported the Beaumonts against Juan and the Gramonts, but Fernando was able to convince his father that Castile could play a role in the pacification of Navarre. Instead of dropping the support of the Beaumonts, Fernando signs with Juan the Treaty of Tudela in 1476, establishing a defensive protectorate of Castile over Navarre. The Castilian protectorate will last thirty years, and although it will not end the war between the Beaumonts and Gramonts, it will greatly abate it. It will also serve as a Spanish counterweight against the French orientation of the House of Foix. At the treaty of Pamplona-Medina del Campo in January 1494, Jean and Catherine accepted the marriage of their heir to the heir of Spain, and the continuation of the Castilian protectorate. This allowed them to defeat Jean of Foix-Narbonne, who renounced to his claim to the crown of Navarre in 1497. But the confrontation between Spain and France that was starting in Italy left no room for a neutral Navarre. Strategically, Navarre could be used as a backdoor to invade the neighboring country, allowing the armies to cross the Pyrenees unmolested. A war between France and Spain over Navarre was in the horizon. This time Navarre seemed to tilt towards Spain.;x

EVENTNAME285042;The conquest of Navarre;x
EVENTHIST285042;The alliance of Jean d'Albret and Louis XII of France in the context of the wars of Italy, precipitated the Spanish invasion of Navarre. The Beaumonts supported the invasion, and surrendered Pamplona to the Old Duke of Alba. The Gramonts were quickly overrun. The French armies under command of the Dauphin made numerous mistakes, ignoring the requests of Jean d'Albret, using the Navarrans and Gascoigners to lead the assaults and abusing the local population. The siege of Pamplona was a complete failure, and with the arrival of the winter they suffered grave loses, retreating back to France in a difficult march across the Pyrenees. By the spring of 1513, the Spaniards had resisted the French attack in the Basque region and were the masters of Navarre. That year, Fernando was crowned King of Navarre, and in 1515, he surprisingly decided to incorporate Navarre to the Kingdom of Castile.;x

EVENTNAME285044;Expulsion of the Spanish Jews;x
EVENTHIST285044;Medieval Spain was unique in Western Europe for the diversity of its population. In addition to a large segment of Muslims, Spain had the single largest Jewish community in the world, with three hundred thousand souls. In the 14th Century, however, anti-Jewish attitudes were on the rise throughout Europe. In 1290, England expelled its Jews and France followed in 1306. Spain began to experience an increasing anti-Jewish sentiment. It exploded in the summer of 1391 with angry anti-Jewish riots with hundreds of deaths. These riots led to major forced conversions of Jews to Christianity. Unlike the remaining Jews, the converts were welcomed into a full participation in Spanish society and they would soon become leaders in government, science, business and the Church. Over the years the Old Christians saw these converted families as opportunists who secretly maintained the faith of their forefathers. It was a strong mixture of racial prejudice and jealousy against the converts that would stir-up the Spanish Inquisition to prosecute the minority of false-converts. On March 31, 1492, Isabel and Fernando signed the edict of expulsion of all Jews in their Kingdoms by July 31. They were allowed to sell their properties and take their valuables, and money in letters of payment, but no gold or silver. The Kings intended to force the conversion of most of them, and indeed many converted, raising the proportion of Jews converted along the century to two thirds of their original population. But many also chose to leave, their numbers still debated, but probably over 100,000, most of them from Castilla, Toledo, Andalucia, and Murcia. It was a popular measure probably intended to forge a national identity for Spain, and also due to the belief that the Jews were a bad influence to the converts. The Jews that went to Portugal, Navarra, Provence and Morocco, suffered prosecution, violence and new expulsions, and the Kings of Spain allowed the return of those willing to convert until 1499. Those that went to Italy and Constantinople fared better. The economic consequences of the expulsion were negative as the Jews paid increased taxes, lent money to Kings and nobles, and administered properties. Culturally it was an even greater loss.;x

EVENTNAME285045;The Encomiendas;x
EVENTHIST285045;With the discovery of the New World, the Spanish had to decide what to do with their new subjects. Unlike the Muslims, that could be enslaved, pagans were seen as not having rejected Christianity, and hence entitled to freedom and religious education. To educate and indoctrinate the indians, a feudal institution was transplanted from Spain to the New World in 1493: the encomienda. Within this system, a group of indians were entrusted to the encomendero, who theoretically had no jurisdiction over them, and had to provide for their instruction and indoctrination and could not mistreat them. In exchange the encomendero was to receive tributes from his indians, in the form of indian products or labor. The system could not work with an ocean between the rulers and the colonists, and soon the encomenderos were taking the land from the indians in their encomienda, and exploiting them cruelly, often to death. Although the production and trade of the colonies increased on the slave work of the indians, soon voices raised against the inhumane treatment of the indians and their likely consequences. Between them, the most ardent advocate of the indians was Fray Bartolome de las Casas, a Dominican priest, that had been an encomendero himself. But the encomenderos were the political force in the colonies, and they were not willing to renounce to the source of their wealth. They claimed that without indian labor the economy of the colonies would collapse. At the same time, the encomiendas served as a great incentive for the conquests of the continent, as the conquistadors granted the conquered land and indians as encomiendas to their soldiers.;x

EVENTHIST285046;Fray Bartolome de las Casas was not alone in his defense of Indian rights. Many other priests and some officials in the colonies denounced the abuses and atrocities. The Emperor and his court were horrified. After the conquest of New Spain (the Inca), Charles was displeased in the bloody way that it had been conducted by Pizarro and decided to regulate the treatment and rights of the Indians through legislation, according to the advice from Las Casas. The New Laws enacted in 1542 forbade any kind of slavery and forced labor, allowed ownership of land by the Indians, and stated that the Church had no authority over non-Christian natives. They also forbade the stablishment of new encomiendas and reduced the size of existing ones. The New Laws caused quite a stir in the colonies and it was predicted that they would bring ruin to the colonists.;x

EVENTNAME285047;The Rebellion of the Encomenderos;x
EVENTHIST285047;With the New Laws that changed the system of encomiendas, the conquistadors believed that the King was depriving them of the just reward for their efforts and suffering. When the intransigent Viceroy Blasco Nuñez de Vela arrived to Lima to enforce the New Laws, a rebellion of encomenderos started in Peru, leaded by Gonzalo Pizarro, brother of Francisco. After killing the Viceroy, part of the rebels sailed to Panama, conquering the city. The rebellion lasted for four years, until 1548, when Gonzalo Pizarro was defeated in the battle of Jaquijahuana and beheaded. However the rebellions and protests had two important effects. The New Laws were amended, and although the slavery continued abolished, and the worst abuses prevented, the encomiendas were in fact sanctioned, much to the dismay of Las Casas. Similar systems to the encomiendas were also implemented by Portugal, France and Holland in their colonies. The other important effect was that the Royal Council forbade any new conquest unless the Council of the Indies deemed them esential. This policy was reversed in the 1560s due to the advance of the rival European powers.;x

EVENTNAME285048;An empire where the sun never sets;x
EVENTHIST285048;The Philippines had been discovered by Magellan in 1524, in his expedition around the world. They were given their name in the expedition of Villalobos of 1542, to honor prince Philip, future King of Spain. Andres de Urdaneta, a sailor in that expedition, that had become a friar, claimed that he could find a way of returning from the East Indies to Mexico accross the Pacific, a trip that in 40 years had only been done in the opposite way. His claim raised the interest of the authorities and an expedition was organized. Urdaneta wanted to go to New Guinea, and island discovered by the Spaniards. The expedition was put under command of Miguel Lopez de Legazpi. When they departed from Barra de Navidad (Jalisco) on November 21, 1564, they opened the orders that commanded them to the Philippines and Urdaneta accepted them. After reaching the islands and exploring them, and while Legazpi started the conquest, Urdaneta sailed Northwest until he discovered the current of Kuro Siwo, that took him for the first time, back to America, arriving to Acapulco in October 1565. The return trip was very long and dangerous, taking from 5 to 7 months, but it was very important because it stablished the connexion of the Philippines to the rest of the empire, allowing the viability of its colonization. The conquest of the Philippines led Charles V to declare that in his realms the sun never set, a phrase that became popular for future empires also.;x

EVENTHIST285049;In the Philippines, Spain found herself fighting the expansion of Islam at the other end of the world, the same it had started doing in the Iberian peninsula. The conquest of the Philippines was for Spain the most difficult of all. However it also compensated the effort. In Philippines existed a colony of Chinese traders, and Europe longed for Chinese wares. However China was self-suficcient. The only product that China sought was silver, and Spain produced silver in Mexico and Peru. Additionally, the Eastern route from Philippines to Spain around the Cape of Good Hope was closed by the Dutch, so an indirect trade route was established by a fleet that connected Manila to Acapulco, and then by land to Veracruz, where the fleet of Indias would take the trade to Sevilla. Almost every year, a fleet would depart from Acapulco to Manila loaded with silver, and another would depart from Manila to Acapulco loaded with spices, silkcloths and chinaware. The benefits were enormous, between 300 and 500 percent, and the arrival of the Manila galleon constituted one of the main events in Mexico and Spain, as people were fascinated with their products. Protectionist measures from the traders in Sevilla regulated the number of ships to two merchant galleons plus escorts, and the galleons from Manila became the biggest ships built in their time.;x

EVENTNAME285050;Treaty of Alcacovas Rejected;x
EVENTHIST285050;In 1469 Alfonso V of Portugal was presented with the opportunity of becoming the King of Castile when he and his brother-in-law Enrique IV of Castile agreed on his marriage to Isabel, Princess of Asturias (heir title). But the deal failed when Isabel married Fernando of Aragon. When Enrique died and Isabel proclaimed herself Queen, in 1475, he saw his chance disappearing and decided to play hard. In a month he was married to his niece, Juana, and had claimed the crown of Castile for himself, invading the country. The plan was good because Juana had also the support of France and a great part of the Castilian nobility who rebelled in her support. Despite the simultaneous invasion from France and Portugal, and the rebellion of the nobles in the West of Castile, the war did not go well. The French were stopped by the Basques, while Fernando, with troops mostly from Castile and Asturias, inflicted a crushing defeat to the Portuguese in Toro in 1476. Alfonso traveled to France to try to get a stronger involvement from Louis XI, but the French had lost interest. By then Fernando had recovered control of all the Northwest. The war at sea, that extended as far as the coast of Guinea, claimed by Castile, was also favorable to Isabel. Alfonso's marriage to his niece was not recognized by the Pope, and a last invasion at the South ended also in defeat at la Albuera in February, 1479. With the nobility subdued and the Portuguese defeated, Castile had now the upper hand, but Isabel was half Portuguese herself, and Portuguese was her first language. She desired a perpetual peace with Portugal, with long lasting friendship and perhaps a dynastic union in the future, like the one with Aragon, and she was prepared to be generous with the defeated to obtain it. The treaty of Alcacovas, was concluded in September 4, 1479. It had four parts, all of them historically important. In the first part, Isabel and Fernando were recognized as rightful Kings of Castile and Leon, and Alfonso was recognized as rightful King of Portugal. In the second part, Juana renounced to her claim to the crown of Castile and was forced to expend the rest of her life in a convent in Portugal. In the third part, the future marriage between the infant Alfonso, son of Joao and the infant Isabel, daughter of the Catholic Kings was arranged. And in the fourth part, Castile accepted the claim of Portugal over Guinea, and the Atlantic coast of Africa, Madeira, Azores and Cape Verde, and any future discoveries South of the Canary Islands toward Guinea. Portugal accepted the claim of Castile over the Canary Islands. Alfonso has chosen to reject our generous offer, and has decided to maintain his claim to the crown of Castile. He also reclaims the Canary Islands, despite the Pope's sentence in our favour.;x

EVENTNAME285051;The Statutes of Blood Cleanliness;x
EVENTHIST285051;The massive conversion of Jews and the expulsion of those unwilling to convert did not end the religious and racial tensions in Spain. In fact, due to their higher education and wealth, the converts soon reached positions not available to them before their conversion. The Spanish society of the Old Christians reacted to them with rejection, but the problem was how to identify them. The solution was the Statutes of Blood Cleanliness, that demanded that to achieve a certain position, the candidate was required to demonstrate that his ancestors were Old Christians. They were imposed by the society against the wishes of the Kings and popes starting in Toledo in 1449. Gradually some university colleges, religious orders and military orders were imposing them. Cases of false converts discovered by the Inquisition between friars fueled them, leading to a papal approval in 1496. The priest Juan Martinez Siliceo was named religious educator of prince Felipe by the Emperor Carlos, and was rewarded with the position of Archbishop of Toledo, and later Cardinal. He was an intransigent fanatic, and he was able to impose the Statutes of Blood Cleanliness in the Church in 1547 despite important opposition. Soon they were extended to any position of responsibility, both public and private. The Status were an important factor in the obsession with racial purity and lineage that overtook the Spanish society for 200 years, since it was essential to have a clean lineage to advance in the society.;x

EVENTNAME285052;The mad prince Carlos;x
EVENTHIST285052;Felipe II was only married for one year to Maria Manuela of Portugal from whom he had a heir, prince Carlos, before she died. However soon it was evident that Carlos had some mental disease. He was incoherent, sadistic, choleric, and unpredictable, frightening those around him, and filling the court with anxiety about the future of the Kingdom in such hands. His madness was manifested in many ways, but the most famous one was when he tried to run away to the Low Countries to take command of the Protestants against his own father. The situation was unsustainable, especially when he started to attack with knives and swords significant members of the court like the Duke of Alba or his uncle Don Juan. On the night of the 18th of January, 1568, the prince was confined under vigilance in his quarters. Four months later the prince died of unknown causes. The best theory is that his behavior worsened in captivity and it was not unusual for him to fast for days and then stuff himself with his favorite meals, with one of this pantagruelian feasts causing his death. Since no explanation could be given about his death at the time, the many enemies of Felipe II used it to start a black legend about him. The legend was given credit and the mad Carlos was turned into a romantic hero that fought against the oppression of his father. Schiller wrote a theater piece named Don Carlos in 1787, and Verdi turned it into an opera in 1867. In fact, madness was running in the family, starting with Isabel of Portugal, mother of Isabel la Catolica, and following with her granddaughter Juana the Mad, grandmother of Felipe II.;x

He was extraordinarily intelligent and raised to the post of his father with Felipe II, but being disolute and unescrupulous, soon became corrupt. He became the lover of the widow of his former protector, the one-eyed princess of Eboli. Their intrigues lead Antonio Perez to order the killing of the secretary of the King's half brother, Juan de Austria, in March 1578, because he knew too much and was pressuring him. Although initially Felipe II was inclined to protect him, the outcry from the opposite faction was too big, and although the charges for murder were not brought upon him, a long process for corruption, that was to take several years, was initiated.;x

Once in Zaragoza, he was imprisoned, but he claimed protection from the fueros of Aragon. According to these laws dating to the old Kingdom of Aragon, the King could not prosecute a man from Aragon for a crime committed in Castilla. In a climate of confrontation between Aragon and the King for previous events, the clever Antonio Perez, skillfully managed to convince many, that the King wanted to use his case to abolish the fueros, and the Justice of Aragon decided to protect him. Felipe then resorted to the only tribunal whose jurisdiction reached all the Kingdoms, the Inquisition. Charges of heresy were brought upon Antonio Perez, using also his sacrilegous origen as son of a Catholic priest and a married woman, and the Inquisition ordered his transfer to its own jail in Zaragoza. But, the Justice decided that the fueros were being violated and raised in rebellion, and the Viceroy of Aragon was killed. The army was sent to Zaragoza, where it entered without a shot, as the rebellion dissolved. But by then Antonio Perez had escaped to France.

EVENTHIST285057;Following the undeclared war that Elizabeth, Queen of England, was waging against Spain, attacking her fleets, coastal cities and colonies, and supporting the Dutch protestants at war against Spain, Felipe decided to attack England, and gave orders to prepare a huge fleet to lead an invasion. But the problems started before the fleet was assembled, when Alvaro de Bazan, the Marquis of Santa Cruz, hero of many naval battles, died. The operation was put under the command of Alonso Guzman, the Duke of Medina-Sidonia, who was a great organizer and contributed financially, but was no seaman. 130 ships with 30,000 men departed Lisbon, but of them only 20 were big galleons, and most of the ships were merchant ships of many classes refitted with cannons and some Mediterranean galleases. Bad leadership, terrible storms and superior English naval tactics and cannons, turned the expedition into a disaster. The crucial point of the expedition, the embarkment of the Tercios of Alessandro Farnese, the Duke of Parma, near Calais, could not be achieved. The return trip was a nightmare due to bad weather, and in total 60 ships and 20,000 men were lost, 85 percent of them in the coasts of Ireland. The news were badly received in Spain, little used to serious defeats, but a lesson was learned. The crown understood that it needed a permanent royal navy, and that the ships and cannons had to be improved. As a consequence the Spanish navy was improved, corsair attacks diminished, the colonies were safer and the fleet of Indias arrived with regularity. Spain continued ruling the seas until the next century, when the Dutch achieved naval superiority over the then decadent Spanish empire.;x

EVENTHIST285058;Following the defeat of the Spanish Armada, England quickly organized a large fleet to attack the Atlantic fleet that was largely intact and under repair at the Northern ports of Spain. But for England it was difficult to quickly obtain financing for such an expensive enterprise, and so the goals were expanded to attract new investors. The fleet was to destroy the Spanish ships under repair, to invade Portugal to trigger a rebellion and instate a Portuguese claimant on the throne, to capture the Azores, and to capture also the Spanish treasure fleet to compensate the expenses for a financially troubled England. Francis Drake and John Norris were put in command, but the expedition resulted in a disaster of a similar magnitude to the Spanish armada. Nothing of substance was achieved, and a military defeat at Lisbon, diseases and storms, decimated the fleet, that it is said to have lost 10,000 men. Thanks to it, the Spanish fleet recovered and in the next decade dominated again the seas, shipping three times more gold than the previous decades, while England suffered a chain of defeats. The most important of them was the disastrous raid to Puerto Rico and Panama in 1595, also with great loss of lives, including those of the hated corsairs Hawkins and Drake. The Spanish colonial empire was safe. As a result of these defeats and the financial troubles of England, James I would seek peace with Spain in the same terms offered by Felipe II prior to the Spanish Armada, but by then the war in the Low Countries had already been lost.;x

EVENTHIST285059;The Jesuits that arrived to Japan in the XVI century were well received. However the daimyo (military chief) Toyotomi Hideyoshi was going to end the religious tolerance. After unifying the country, he started an expansionistic policy, invading Korea. He sent a menacing letter to the Spanish governor of the Philippines demanding their submission to Japan in 1591. Governor Dasmariñas sent a peace embassy formed by several Franciscans and leaded by Fray Pedro Bautista in 1593. The embassy was successful, and Hideyoshi allowed them to stay in Kyoto. Their work was fruitful between the oppressed Japanese lower classes, and soon they expanded to Nagasaki and Osaka. But all that changed when a Spanish galleon from Manila in route to Acapulco shipwrecked in the island of Sikoku, loaded with a treasure in luxury merchandise from China, India, and the Philippines. The samurai of Sikoku and Hideyoshi representatives started to dispute over the cargo, but a ship's officer reclaimed its ownership by Spain. To further his demands he showed a map with all the lands owned by Spain to be compared with the size of Japan. He was asked how so many lands could be conquered when in their ships so few soldiers were carried. -We first send the priests- was his imprudent answer. Hideyoshi reacted to this words by ordering the crucifixion of all the Franciscans. Six Spanish and seventeen Japanese Franciscan friars, together with 3 Jesuits thrown in the lot were tortured and crucified. It was only the beginning of the repression, and after the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1613, the country was closed to Europeans for 284 years from 1637, and Christianity eradicated by mass executions. The Philippines governor was in no condition to respond, and so the route of the Manila galleon was changed from the Kuro Siwo current to the Equatorial Counter Current, to protect its cargo.;x

EVENTNAME285060;Luis I the Well-Beloved;x
EVENTHIST285060;In many lists of Spanish Kings one is missing. On the tenth of January 1724, Felipe V unexpectedly decided to abdicate. He alleged a desire to dedicate to religious works, but the death in the previous month of the Duke of Orleans, regent and heir to the throne of France had opened his possibility of inheriting the Kingdom of France from his sickly nephew, as he was the grandson of Louis XIV. By virtue of the will of Carlos II and the Peace of Utrecht, he could not rule both France and Spain, but he had not abdicated of his personal rights to the crown of France. A month later, on the 9th of February, his son Louis was crowned as King of Spain. He was 17 years old and childish, despite being already married. His court in Madrid was supervised by his father from the palace of La Granja de San Ildefonso, not far from the capital. But his rule was not to bear any consequence and was called the lightning rule, as he soon fell sick of smallpox, the same disease that exterminated the family of his cousin Louis XV of France. Luis died the 31 of August, 1724, seven months after becoming King. He was called the Well-Beloved because his very young wife cared for him during his disease despite the considerable risk to her own life. His brother Fernando was his heir, but his father Felipe illegally retook the crown, given that Louis XV of France recovered and that his second wife Isabel de Farnesio wanted to be Queen, and nobody disputed his right. But the second rule of Felipe V was worse than the first, as he was affected by a progressive mental disease, and his wife, Duchess and heir of Parma, involved Spain in the recovery of the Italian territories for her sons. Felipe V renounced to his rights to the French throne in 1725.;x

EVENTNAME285061;Manuel Godoy, Prince of Peace;x
EVENTHIST285061;Manuel Godoy was an army officer that raised to power through his affairs with the Queen of Spain, Maria Luisa de Parma. He became prime minister just prior to the declaration of war by Revolutionary France to Spain, after the reaction of Carlos IV to his cousin Louis XVI execution. After initial Spanish successes, the previous prime minister, the Count of Aranda, defended peace negotiations, but the war was popular and Godoy persisted until it turned into a disaster. At the peace of Basilea in 1795, Spain ceded the island of Santo Domingo to France and Godoy was given the title of Prince of Peace. At the first treaty of San Ildefonso in 1796 between France and Spain, Godoy turned the Spanish foreign policy into French hands, leading to a permanent confrontation with England of catastrophic consequences. Despite his efforts he failed to improve the economy. Finally his submission to Napoléon will lead to the invasion of Spain, and the forced abdication of Carlos IV. He was exiled by Fernando VII, and rehabilitated by Isabel II in 1847, a few years before his death in Paris.;x

EVENTNAME285062;The disentailment of Godoy;x
EVENTHIST285062;Over centuries, Spain had become a very improductive country. Its economy was mainly based in agriculture, yet a great deal of its land were in dead hands: nobles that did not pay taxes and could not afford to cultivate them, and the Church. Also many urban properties were in the hands of conventual orders. As a result, tax income was low. The liberals proposed a disentailment of these improductive properties, and the acute need for money during the war with Britain forced the approval of the measure. However it was a missed opportunity. The impoverished peasants could not afford the disentailed properties, and their communal lands were also taken out of their hands and sold. It only profited the bourgeoisie and rich nobles that bought the properties at a reduced price, and even the State was shortchanged by the corruption and by the subsidies that it had to pay to the Church as compensation. It also produced the irrecoverable loss of many books and cultural goods property of the Church. In the end the Spanish disentailments turned out to be another good idea with a bad implementation. Their social and economic effects were negligible, although they provided short term money for the state treasury.;x

EVENTNAME285063;The second treaty of San Ildefonso;x
EVENTHIST285063;After the first treaty of San Ildefonso, Spain became a reliable ally for France in her wars with England, however Spain suffered the worse part. Her navy was seriously damaged, and her vital commerce with her American colonies was interrupted, strangling her economy, and she was finally forced to sue for peace. This situation left Napoléon's navy in a complete inferiority in the peninsula, as the British navy could use the ports in Portugal, her traditional ally. Napoléon needed Spanish collaboration to win the war at sea, however Spain, now at peace with England wanted to remain neutral. To Napoléon, Spanish collaboration was vital, not only to prevent shipping to England from Spanish ports, but also to enforce the blockade in Portugal. Spanish prime minister, Manuel Godoy, was given no choice, either with France or against France, and he vowed to Napoléon demands. England used the treaty as a justification to declare war to Spain.;x

EVENTHIST285064;After the signing of the second treaty of San Ildefonso, France started to pressure Spain to collaborate in an invasion of Portugal to dislodge her from her alliance with England. Carlos IV was the father-in-law of Joao VI, prince of Brazil and regent of Portugal, and did not desire a conflict, but French pressure was too strong. Joao could not accept Napoléon's demands of ceding a quarter of his territory to Spain as a guarantee, and so the war became inevitable. On May 20, 1801, Godoy invaded Portugal from three points, and in nine days completely defeated the Portuguese army, before the French army sent to participate in the campaign could cross Spain. Godoy sent a branch of an orange tree from the moat of Elvas to his Queen and lover, and hence the name of the war. But Carlos IV had no intention of leaving Portugal in the hands of Napoléon, and against his instructions, signed the treaty of Badajoz with Joao. It was a very favorable treaty for Portugal, who had to pay indemnities to France, close her ports to British ships, cede a small part of the Guiana to France, and the small town of Olivenza to Spain. The treaty was signed on the 8th of June, but dated on the 6th, so Carlos could ignore Napoléon's instructions received on the 7th. Napoléon was furious and did not ratify the treaty until the 29th of September.;x

EVENTHIST285065;In 1519 the King commissioned the Portuguese-born Magellan to reach the Spice Islands by sailing west around South America. After many hardships he succeeded in reaching and then sailing across the Pacific Ocean. Soon thereafter he was killed while trying to subdue the natives on what is now the island of Mactan in the Philippines. After still more hardships, one of his original five ships, Victoria, commanded by J. Sebastián Elcano eventually made it back to Spain. Only 18 out of initial approximatively 260 crew members made return to Spain after 3 years of navigation. Magellan's expedition was the first to circumnavigate the globe definitively proving the roundness of the earth and the first to navigate the strait in South America connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Antonio Pigafetta, a wealthy tourist who paid to be on the voyage, kept an accurate journal of the trip and provided the only extant eyewitness account of the events culminating in Magellan's death.;x

EVENTHIST285067;Zenon Somodevilla, marquis of Ensenada, was a minister of the King of Spain, who realized that the Spanish navy was falling behind those of other nations. He started a program of naval reformation by studying the naval technologies of every country in Northern Europe, from England to Russia, even resorting to industrial spionage. He then hired English shipbuilders, and constructed what would become Spanish modern shipyards at Ferrol (Coruña), Cartagena (Murcia) and Cadiz. His reforms were very succesful and allowed the Spanish navy to remain competitive until the Napoleonic wars. Over the seventeen century, sediments had covered the bottom of the Guadalquivir river, and Sevilla lost her famous port.;x

EVENTHIST285069;First created in Italy in the Renaissance, the Academies were organized centers to develop literature, arts or sciences. In the XVII century they were introduced in France where they acquired their character of national centers of promotion and authority in their subjects, under Government protection. But it is in the next century, when Enlightenment spreads all over Europe, that the rest of the countries will introduce them. In Spain, the Royal Library that would later become the National Library, was created in 1712 by Felipe V. The first Academy instituted was the Royal Academy of Spanish Language and Literature in 1714. It was followed in 1735 by the Royal Academy of History, and in 1752 by the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando, that included Arts and Mathematics. In those years, the Royal Botanical Garden, the Astronomical Observatory, and the Natural History Royal Cabinet were also created.

The Spanish monarchy, as those of other European countries, was horrified by the events, and blamed the enlightenment and liberalism of the previous decades. The French revolution was considered an infectious disease that had to be stopped before it spreaded. Internally, the borders with France were closed, and all the reformation programs were stopped. Censorship and repression were instaurated and left in the hands of the Inquisition, that will prosecute the main reformists. Cabarrus was imprisoned, Jovellanos exiled, and Campomanes ousted. Externally, the prime minister Floridablanca was given the job of saving the life of Louis XVI of France, cousin of the Spanish King, and when he failed, the traditional alliance with France was broken and an alliance was sought with Great Britain, Holland, Austria, Portugal and Prussia, forming the First Coalition.;x

EVENTNAME285071;Enlightenment reforms of Carlos III;x
EVENTHIST285071;Carlos III was King of Naples when he became King of Spain at the death of his half-brother Fernando VI, and he brought with him several Italian administrators. Sicilian Leopoldo Gregorio, marquis of Squillace (in Calabria), was his favorite minister. Carlos, after 30 years of absence from Spain did not identify himself with the country, and was a reformist, clear example of enlightened absolutism. The Government of Esquilache, as he was known in Spain, introduced very needed economic reforms, but was defeated in its attempts to tax the nobility. However the creation of the Royal Lottery increased the state revenues, and the economical power of the Church was limited. Other important measures were the banning of private weapons, and the night lighting and organization of trash cleaning in Madrid, considered the dirtiest city in Europe.;x

EVENTHIST285072;The reforms introduced by Esquilache were badly needed, however, the precarious economic situation suggested a more cautious approach. The liberalization of grain prices in a context of several bad crops produced a sharp increase in bread prices provoking the discontent in the lower classes. Esquilache, still impetuous and against advice by other counselors, published a decree banning the long cloaks and wide rim hats in use, because of security reasons. Indeed brigands were using the cloaks to hide weapons, and the hats to hide their identity. But for the populace of Madrid, it was the last straw from the hated Italian ministers, made responsible for the price crisis, and they riotted destroying the street lamps recently installed. They requested from the King the reduction of bread price and the expulsion of Esquilache. The King, surprised by the revolt, but seeing that his authority was not questioned, agreed to their demands. Esquilache went back to Sicily, and was years later named ambassador in Venice. However the King used the change of administration to introduce the Spanish reformists and oust the anti-reformists. Pedro Pablo Abarca, count of Aranda, became the Spanish prime minister. Aranda, took a different approach to the problem. He convinced the nobility to change their outfit, and decreed that the official executioner would dress a long cloak and wide rim hat, and soon everybody stopped using them.;x

It was considered that the populace could not produce the ellaborate pamphlets that had inflamated the masses. Probably the nobility was behind them, since they hated Esquilache for his fiscal policies of taxing the rich. However the comission found a more convenient scapegoat, the Society of Jesus. Already at a low point after their expulsion from Portugal in 1758, and France in 1764, the Jesuits were seeing as being more affect to the Pope than to the King, and had a fame of regicides after the assesination attempt at Jose I of Portugal of which they were accused of having prior knowledge. Secret orders were distributed to be opened at midnight on the first of April, and in the next morning, 6000 Jesuits were marched like convicts to the coast and embarked towards Papal States. The Spanish and Italian Bourbons, then used all their influence to have the order suppressed by the next Pope in 1673. The properties of the Jesuits in Spain and all her territories were seized, and the important void that the Jesuits left in higher education was used to reform it.;x

EVENTNAME285074;The Honorable Council of the Mesta;x
EVENTHIST285074;The Mesta was an association of sheepholders created in Castile in 1273 by Alfonso X the Wise. Its origen was the use of lands near the borders with the Muslims during the Reconquista, as no crops could be grown due to constant hostilities, while sheep flocks could easily be hidden during the algaradas or Muslim attacks. The substitution of the original Churra race of sheeps by the higher quality Merina, introduced in Spain by the Marinid berbers, increased the wealth of the Mesta and the Crown income, and the Kings started a policy of protecting the Mesta at the expense of agriculture and forests. Sheep flocks in Central Spain required summer and winter pastures and free routes between them, and the Mesta herds had the right to drink from any water and eat from any land, paying for that priviledge a quantity decided by the Mesta. They could also cut forests, and no land could be fenced along their routes. This policy reached its peak with the Catholic Kings, when the oldest member of the Royal Council became also the president of the Mesta Council, and when the regulations of 1492 were stablished. The taxes over the rights of pass were reduced, but they were shifted from the local towns directly to the Crown. By then the Mesta controlled 125,000 km of routes and half a million hectares (over a million acres) of productive lands. It had its own judicial system and its own law enforcement agents and was perhaps the most important corporate organization in Medioeval Europe. As is the case with other nomad populations, the shephards of the Mesta were the best soldiers of Spain and constituted the main source of recruits for the elite Tercios. The Mesta was for a long time the main source of wealth for Castile, as its precious wool was exported to the North of Europe, but some consequences could not be foreseen, and the production of cereals started to decline. The Honorable Council of the Mesta will last until 1836, and even today many Mesta routes are protected forever from urban development to be enjoyed no longer by sheeps, but by weekend excursionists. As a curiosity, the word mustang derives from mesteño, or mesta animal.;x

EVENTNAME285075;The Treaty of Barcelona between the Emperor and the Pope;x
EVENTHIST285075;The Emperor believed that peace had finally been achieved with France after François Ier agreed to renounce his claims in Italy. But within two months of his release, Francis had retracted from his word and signed the league of Cognac, bringing into it the Pope, Milan, Florence, Venice and England. But for Giulio de Medici, Pope Clement VII, it was a huge mistake to take sides with France, as Rome was sacked by the Lutheran German mercenaries of Charles under lack of pay. Charles got his army under control, and Clement became his prisoner, and had to pay 300,000 ducats and surrender several fortresses for his release. But in the meantime, the Florentines had raised and expelled the Medici, declaring a Republic, and part of the Papal States also wanted to become independent. Now Clement needed Charles more than the emperor needed the Pope and a deal was struck. Charles agreed to restore the Papal States, to return Florence to Medici rule, to name Clement's illegitimate son from a black slave Alessandro Medici, il Moro, hereditary Duke of Florence and to give him his own illegitimate daughter from a Flemish servant, Margaret of Austria, in marriage. In exchange Clement will crown him as emperor and will become his lifelong ally. The treaty of Barcelona was signed on June 29, 1529, and Clement and Charles will meet at Bologna at the end of the year, with the crowning taking place on February 24, 1530 in the same city. Charles V will be the last Holy Roman Emperor to be crowned by a Pope. A consequence of this alliance will be that Clement will refuse the divorce of Henry VIII from the emperor's aunt, Catalina, even at the cost of driving England into Protestantism.;x

Carlos III decided to change the naval flag, and he was presented with 12 designs selected by Antonio Valdes, minister of the navy, from a contest. They were two color combinations of red, yellow, white and blue, having only in common the fact that they could be easily distinguished from far away. His choice was a flag with two horizontal red stripes separated by a yellow stripe, but the King decided to further modify it and make the yellow stripe twice as wide, making it even more characteristic. In 1843, under the rule of Isabel II, it was decided that the naval flag would constitute the national flag of Spain.;x

EVENTNAME285077;Admiral of a New World;x
EVENTHIST285077;On his first voyage, Columbus reached the Great Antilles, discovering Cuba and la Hispaniola (divided today in Haiti and Dominican Republic), were the natives were amiables. On December 24, 1492, his biggest ship, la Santa Maria, suffered damages beyond repair in la Hispaniola. Since there was not enough room for everybody to return, they constructed a fort with the ship's wood, called Fort Christmas, and forty men were left behind, with the promise of returning the following year. Columbus took some indians with him, together with fruits, plants, parrots, and gold. But another less innocuous exchange was taking place. The Europeans took with them smallpox and typhus to the New World, and from then on, wherever they went the plagues preceded them. About 50 percent of the natives in the New World died in the following decades, and possibly only 20 percent of the original population levels remained a century later. All the plagues suffered by Europe since the middle ages, concentrated in a single deathly wave that swept the entire continent. In exchange the Europeans brought a new disease to the Old World, syphilis. No women were allowed in the first expedition, and clearly Columbus sailors did not remain idle. Introduced by the Spanish sailors in Seville and Naples, the disease would be spread throughout Italy and the rest of Europe by the French armies of Charles VIII in his failed attempt to conquer Naples, being known in those days as the French disease. Columbus remained ignorant of having changed the history of mankind, and thinking only that he had found a better way to reach India, in his second voyage, he will command a big fleet with enough colonists, farm animals, seeds, and priests to establish a colony in la Hispaniola (Barahona and Tortuga). The first permanent European colony in the New World.;x

EVENTHIST285078;The colonization of the New World started in the island of La Hispaniola, where Columbus returned in 1493 to discover that the first settlement, Fort Christmas, had been wiped out by natives. But Christopher and his brothers Diego and Bartolome were very bad administrators and were distrusted by the Spaniards for being foreigners. Quarrels and rebellions abounded, and by 1495 everybody in the colony wanted to return to Spain. The colony was a sink for money, and Columbus, aware that his promises of riches to the Kings have not been fulfilled, insisted in slaving natives and sending them to Seville. This was a legitimate trade for a Genoese, but the Kings influenced by the church had given orders that only natives that raised in arms against Spanish rule could be enslaved. Worried by all this problems, the Kings named Francisco Bobadilla new governor of La Hispaniola in 1500, but he went as far as to put Columbus in chains and send him back to Spain. The Kings, horrified, released him, and named Fray Nicolas de Ovando new governor. Ovando ruthlessly suppressed every rebellion from colonists and natives, killing all the indian caciques (chieftains). He then efficiently administrated the colony, reducing the crown tax to 20 percent, stimulating the productivity and attracting new colonists. Soon the colonist population soared and the island became a good source of income for Spain, and the base for the conquest of the neighboring island of Cuba (Havana, Moron and Guantanamo). By contrast the native population, decimated by diseases and having lost the will to live under European oppression, initiated a decline that will end in their extinction. In 1507, Fernando el Catolico will name Diego Colon, son of Christopher Columbus, new governor of La Hispaniola, in substitution of Ovando.;x

EVENTHIST285079;In 1510, Diego Colon, governor of la Hispaniola, gave orders to Diego Velazquez de Cuellar to conquer the island of Cuba. A veteran of the Italian wars, with three hundred men, and accompanied by Fray Bartolome de las Casas, Diego Velazquez soon took possession of the island, founding several cities and becoming the first governor of the island. Under his rule, the island prospered, and would become three hundred years later the richest province of Spain. The prosperity of the colony and its central role in the shipping to Spain, soon will make it the target of the French corsairs. The first settlement in continental America, in 1511 in Darien (Isthmus), would still depart from la Hispaniola, but Cuba quickly took over the central role of exploration and colonization thanks to the capacity and ambition of Diego Velazquez. He ordered the colonization of Puerto Rico, and several exploration expeditions. The most famous of these would be the expedition of Hernando Cortes in 1519 to the coasts of the Gulf of Mexico. But this expedition soon escaped Velazquez control when Cortes decided to disembark in the coasts of Tlaxcala and going beyond his orders, attack the Tlaxcalans, a nation subjugated by the Aztecs.;x

EVENTHIST285080;The first attempt at a continental settlement, at the Eastern side of the Gulf of Darien (Cartagena), failed, and Vasco Nuñez de Balboa suggested the Western side (Isthmus). From there he took the expedition that discovered the Pacific Ocean in 1513. Balboa was popular, but run into problems with the authorities for expelling the inefficient Major of the city. A new administrator was sent from Spain, Pedro Arias de Avila, a 70 year old veteran commander in the wars of Granada and Africa. Cruel and unscrupulous, he was jealous of Balboa and although initially forced to declare him innocent, he would later bring him again to trial, and without possibility of defense or appeal, condem him and have him executed. The authorities were displeased and named a new governor, but he died on the same day he arrived. Since the living conditions in the Gulf of Darien region were appalling, and the diseases made prey on the colonists, Pedro Arias founded in 1519 the city of Panama, the first port in the Pacific, and moved there the capital in 1524. The colonists of Isthmus had received tales of a fabulous country towards the South, named Biru, with cities made of gold. Two adventurers, Francisco Pizarro and Diego Almagro made plans for the conquest of such place, sailing South from Panama. Pedro Arias bought a share in the society, but having lost confidence in the expedition, due to the initial failures, he sold his part in 1526. The same year he was finally deposed.;x

EVENTNAME285081;The military reforms of el Gran Capitán;x
EVENTHIST285081;In 1503, the Catholic Kings reorganized their army introducing a new set of regulations. These regulations were the basis for further reforms introduced that year by two military geniuses. Gonzalo de Ayora realized that the military units of the time were too small for the Renaissance wars, and joined several companies under command of captains into a new type of unit that he called colunela (after Italian colonna or column, later regiment) under command of a new type of officer called colonnelo, and later colonel. At the same time, Gonzalo Fernández de Cordoba, was using his experiences in the wars of Granada and in the first Italian Campaign (1494-1496) to introduce further reforms. From the moors he had learnt to introduce the terrain into the battle equation. From the Swiss at Seminara he learnt the value of pikers armed with swords. He then added two important contributions, a strong sense of loyalty to the general and the King, carefully cultivated to motivate the troops, and the importance of combined arms and firepower for the infantry. He increased the size of his companies to 500 men, of which 200 where pikers, 200 armed with short sword and buckler for short-range combat against enemy pikers, and 100 arquebusiers. This distribution allowed the companies to quickly change from march to combat order, to respond to attack from all sides, and to be effective at all ranges. He then increased the size of his regiments to 12 companies or 6000 infantry, plus 600 cavalry and 20 pieces of artillery. His army could have one or two regiments, being the size of a modern division. These modifications and others related to lines of supplies, intelligence gathering and dynamic defences at encampments resulted in the Spanish infantry being the most modern army of its time and heralded the end of the medieval cavalry. The victories over the French armies that year were continuous: ambush of Barletta, assault on Ruvo, second battle of Seminara, battle of Cerignola, failure of the French invasion of the Roselló, and battle of Garellano. At the capitulation of Gaeta the first of January, 1504, the Kingdom of Naples was won for Spain by el Gran Capitán.;x

EVENTNAME285082;The Spanish Tercios;x
EVENTHIST285082;After the peace of Cambrai, Carlos decided to reorganize his troops in Italy. In his reformation of 1534, he created the Tercios, based on the previous reforms of el Gran Capitán, while modernizing them. Each Tercio was constituted by 3000 men divided in three regiments and 12 companies and was commanded by a Field Marshall. For the first time it included an army command staff that took care of administrative and judicial tasks as well as participating in the military decisions. The elimination of swordsmen allowed an increase in the number of pikers and arquebusiers which carried a sword to fight at close range, resulting in an increase of the Tercios firepower, their main characteristic. The soldiers of the Tercio were all volunteers trained within the regiment giving the units a great cohesion that always allowed them to attack or retreat in good order, greatly increasing their efficiency. The first Tercios formed where those of Naples, Sicily, Sardinia and Lombardy. They were called the old Tercios. Later new Tercios were created, including the Sea Tercios as the first specific units of marines of the world, and the Flandern Tercios in 1567. The reformation was very successful, and over a century the Spanish Tercios were considered invincible. The Tercios will last until 1704 when they were dissolved by Felipe V to adopt a French regiment organization.;x

EVENTNAME285083;The end of the Spanish military domination;x
EVENTHIST285083;The battle of Rocroi in 1643 marks a psychological turning point in European history. For the first time in 150 years, Spain was unable to defeat her enemies in the field of battle. Spain, a small, poor country had been able to build and defend a huge empire. Basing her military success in the army reforms introduced during the war of Granada and the wars of Italy, and financing her never ending wars with the apparently unlimited precious metals from her American conquests, Spain was able to expand in Italy, and defend the troublesome inheritance of the Spanish Habsburgs. But by mid-seventeen century, the Spanish demography simply gave up. The wool crisis affected the shepherds, the main source of soldiers. The exhausted fields of Spain, ineffectually laboured by impoverished serfs, resulted in continuous crop failures, recurrent famines and terrible pestilences from the beginning of the century, that together with the expulsion of the Moors, significantly reduced the size of the population. The scarcity of soldiers was such that anybody taller than 150 cm was accepted, when previously nobody shorter than 170 cm could form in the famous Tercios. The Spanish empire was also weighed down by mismanagement, due to the lack of an educated middleclass to provide competent administrators, as a result of the obsession of the Spanish society with racial purity which glorified the idle nobility, while dismissing merchants and artisans. Spain would be forced to concede defeat in the peace of the Pyrenees, and to accept the independence of Portugal and the Netherlands. France was acknowledged as the new continental power. Instead of reacting to correct the root of her problems, Spain would entrench in defending her diminishing empire, entering a decline that will culminate in the loss of her European possessions after the war of the Spanish succession.;x

EVENTNAME285085;The Execution of Egmont and Hoorn;x
EVENTHIST285085;Lamoral, count of Egmont, was a Dutch noble, cousin of the King of Spain. He received military education in Spain. In January 1546 he was invested in the Golden Fleece Order by Charles V at the same time as the Duke of Alba. At the battle of Saint Quentin in 1557 he led the cavalry at the initial charge, contributing decisively to the Spanish victory over the French troops. A year later he commanded the Spanish army at the decisive victory of Gravelines, where he defeated the French troops led by Montmorency and became a national hero. As a reward he was appointed as stadtholder of Flanders by King Felipe. Although a devout Catholic, faithful to his King, he protested the introduction of the Inquisition in Flanders by bishop Granvelle. He nevertheless reconciled with Felipe and pleaded a change of policy in the Netherlands. When the Dutch revolts started and the Duke of Alba was sent to suppress them with the Edict of Blood, William of Orange advised Egmont and Hoorn to flee Brussels with him. But Egmont and Hoorn believed that their loyalty to the King protected them. Alba arrested them under accusation of treason. In vain Egmont pleaded to be judged by his peers of the Golden Fleece Order or having his case taken to the King. They were both condemned and executed on June 5, 1568. Their death led to large protests in the Netherlands, and contributed to the resistance against the Spaniards. Egmont is the main character in a play of the same name by Goethe.;x

The emission of letters of payment was unsuccessful due to lack of confidence, and thus Francisco Cabarrus, presented the project for a national bank to the Count of Floridablanca, following the example of other countries. By Royal decree, on June 2, 1782, the national bank of San Carlos was created. The bank was successful in dealing with the situation, and was even capable of surviving the Napoleonic war of independence, being converted in 1829 into the bank of San Fernando, that in 1856 will become the Spanish national bank.;x

EVENTNAME285087;The great Gypsy round-up;x
EVENTHIST285087;Linguistic and genetic analysis indicates that Romanies or Gypsies are probably the descendants of a small group of Punjab or Sindh mercenaries at the service of Yamin ul-Dawlah Mahmud, Turkish ruler of Ghazni, who carried out seventeen invasions of India between the years 1001-1026. With the end of the Ghaznavid empire, the Romanies were pushed Westward through Turkish lands while growing in numbers, arriving to the Byzantine empire in the XII century. Soon the Ottomans pushed them further West and they entered the Balkans during the XIV century, were large numbers established. Many continued further West arriving to Western Europe at the beginning of the XV century. In Spain they are first recorded in 1420. As a curiosity, four Gypsies accompanied Columbus on his third voyage to the New World. Despite their European migration, and due to their own ignorance about their origins, they were though to come from Egypt, and they were called Gypsies (from Egyptians). Their nomadic ways were not well received, and they were prosecuted in every country, with specific laws that limited their movement, confined them to certain places, forced them to labor or even expelled them and in some cases executed them. Spain was not an exception in the repression of the Romanies, and one episode was especially terrible. In July 30, 1749, a great inquiry was started to identify the 'bad' Gypsies under the auspices of the marquis of Ensenada, minister of war, and Bishop Gaspar Vázquez Tablada, head of the Royal Council. 12,000 men, women and children were captured over the next days by the army, with the complicity of the Church which had retired the Gypsies the right to Holy Asylum two years before. They were separated, and some men taken to galleys, but most of them went to work as slaves in the shipyards of Cadiz, Cartagena and Ferrol, while the women were confined with their children in Valencia, Zaragoza and Sevilla, and forced to work in manufactories to support themselves, while their properties were seized and sold to reward those that participated in the prosecution. Some voices rose against the measure, and the government started releasing the old and the widows the same year. But it will not be until June 16, 1763 when the King will issue an indult, although the last ones will not be released until 1766, after having spent 17 years in confinement, ruined, their families broken.

EVENTNAME285088;The private war of the Duke of Osuna;x
EVENTHIST285088;Don Pedro Téllez Girón, third Duke of Osuna, was married to a granddaughter of Hernando Cortés. He was made Viceroy of Sicily in 1606, after good military services in Flanders. He was in this post for 10 years, winning the appreciation of the Sicilians for ending the reign of the bandits in the island, and creating a very efficient naval squadron that halted the attacks by Ottoman and Barbary coast pirates, assaulting in several occasions their nests. His protegee, the immortal writer Francisco de Quevedo, acted as his agent in the court of Madrid, and as his spy in Italy. In 1616 he was named Viceroy of Naples. By then, his naval squadron, partly financed from his own money and partly from the corso, and commanded by Francisco de Ribera was extremely efficient, as demonstrated by defeating a much larger Ottoman fleet at the battle of Cape Khelidonia in Antalya. This battle is remembered as the first clash between a fleet of only galleons (Ribera's 6 warships) against a fleet of only galleys (the Ottoman's 55 galleys). In total Osuna had at his service 20 galleys, 20 galleons and 30 smaller ships, that did not cost Spain a single ducat. The previous year, Venice had started the war of Gradisca, also known as Uskok war, against the Austrian Habsburgs, and was also supporting with troops the attempt of the Duke of Savoy at seizing the Marquisate of Mantua and Montferrat from the Gonzaga, allies of Spain. Don Pedro de Toledo, Marquis of Villafranca and Viceroy of Milan, defeated Charles Emmanuel of Savoy with the help of Osuna and the peace of January 1617 restored the original situation, but Osuna wanted to punish Venice for her anti-Spanish stance, and requested from the King of Spain permission to send his naval squadron to the Adriatic. In December 1616, Felipe III authorised the action on the condition of secrecy, and the flag displayed was Osuna's personal flag. During the 1617 season, Osuna's fleet plundered the Venetian traffic and raided the islands in the Adriatic. The Venetians, unable to stop him, loudly protested in Madrid, but although the King publicly repudiated the Viceroy's acts, he did nothing to end the attacks. With the end of the season, the fleet returned to Naples.;x

EVENTNAME285089;The fall of Osuna;x
EVENTHIST285089;In 1618, Osuna was accused of being behind an attempt of overthrowing the Venetian government. Three hundred French and Spaniards at the service of Venice were abruptly executed without explanation, and a rumor started that the Spaniards were trying to take over the Republic. A hunt for foreigners overtook the city, and Quevedo narrowly escaped disguised as a beggar. The Spanish ambassador, Alonso de la Cueva, Marquis of Bedmar, had to leave Venice. Whether the conspiracy was true or an invention of the Council of Ten, the feared security agency of Venice, is still debated, as no convincing evidence was produced. In any case the star of Osuna was declining, and was going to drag Quevedo with him. His political enemies in Naples recruited the help of St. Lawrence of Brindisi, who spoke to the King of Spain against him, and caused Osuna to lose the royal favor. When he was substituted and recalled to Madrid in March 1620, he obeyed. He was then accused of many charges, some of them ridiculous for a Great of Spain, and his vigorous defence had a good chance of having his charges dismissed if not being reinstated as Viceroy, when Felipe III died. The new government of Felipe IV prosecuted the followers of previous minister Lerma, and Osuna died in confinement in September 1624 without having been proven guilty of any crime. Francisco de Quevedo also suffered from prison and exile for his relation with Osuna, but he never abandoned him, and wrote many warm verses about his achievements, including his epitaph. It was not long before Naples and Sicily were again infested by Barbary coast pirates.;x

EVENTNAME285090;The Spanish landing in Ireland;x
EVENTHIST285090;When the Tudor decided to recover control of Ireland they met with stern resistance. The solution applied by Queen Elizabeth I was the establishment of the Plantations, depriving the Irish from their land and giving it to English settlers. When the plantations reached Ulster, Hugh O'Neill, the great Earl of Tyrone rose in rebellion and asked the King of Spain for help. Felipe III considered that it was a good opportunity to tie up English resources and sent a small army under command of Don Juan de Aguila that landed near Cork on October 2, 1601. The landing at the South of the Island when the rebels were at the North, lack of coordination, and lack of Irish experience in pitched battles, contributed to their defeat at the hands of the English army of Lord Mountjoy on January 3, 1602 (December 24, 1601 for the English Julian calendar) at Kinsale. The Spaniards embarked and left Ireland, but Felipe continued supporting the rebels with money. The rebellion was finally suppressed by the English scorched earth strategy, and O'Neill surrendered in March 1603. However the Irish rebellion nearly bankrupted England and contributed to the signing of peace between England and Spain. The Irish did not forget the help received from Spain even if insufficient.;x

EVENTNAME285091;The Irish Tercios;x
EVENTHIST285091;After the Irish rebellion was defeated, many Irishmen left the island and entered the service of Spain, leading to the creation of several Irish Tercios (regiments) that participated in the wars in Netherlands. Their two best commanders were Thomas Preston and Owen Roe O'Neill. Owen Roe (Red) was a nephew of Hugh O'Neill, the great Earl of Tyrone (Ulster) that left Ireland in the Flight of the Earls. He joined the King's army in 1603, when the Irish rebels surrendered, and by 1605 he was already captain. He distinguished himself in many battles, and became famous after his defence of Arras for two months with only 1500 men against 90,000 French soldiers. Thomas Preston was from Meath (Leinster), and entered service with 2,000 Irish soldiers under his command in 1605. He is famous for his defence of Leuven. Both commanders actively recruited Irish soldiers for the Spanish army, and participated in the famous conquest of Breda immortalized by Velazquez. However as good Irish, they were separated by bitter rivalry. After the Irish rebellion of 1641, they both abandoned the service of Spain to join the Irish rebels. Preston was made commander of the Leinster forces and met with mixed results. O'Neill became the commander in chief of the Ulster forces and had great success against the English, until the dissensions between the Confederates paved the way for the Irish defeat and the terrible massacres of Cromwell. Preston would be created Viscount Tara by King Charles II in exile in 1650.;x

EVENTNAME285092;The colonization of California;x
EVENTHIST285092;Several attempts were done at the colonization of California between 1534 and 1697, but the difficulties and inaccessibility of the territory made them all fail. Besides nobody believed there was anything of value there except the pearls in the Sea of Cortes that were regularly fished by expeditions. In 1677, Carlos II ordered a new expedition that, under command of Isidoro Atondo, departed Sinaloa (Mazatlan) in 1683. In the expedition were three Jesuits, one of them Father Eusebio Francisco Kino from Trent. After three years the expedition returned. Father Kino then convinced Father Juan María de Salvatierra to return and they obtained permission from the Viceroy in 1697. They founded the mission of Loreto, now La Paz, in the Southern tip of the peninsula. The new King, Felipe V ordered in 1703 the establishment of military forts to protect the growing number of Jesuit missions in Baja California that in 1766 reached the number of fourteen with the last one near the border between Baja and Alta California. However, life in the missions was difficult, and they were sustained by donations from Mexico, as they received very little official help. Meanwhile Father Kino founded numerous missions in Sonora and Arizona.;x

In 70 years the Jesuits had created 20 villages and 18 missions, although four were closed due to plagues. The Franciscans arrived with the idea of expanding north, and unlike the Jesuits, had full support of the Crown, because there was news of the arrival of the Russians to the coasts of California. Fray Junípero founded the mission of San Diego the next year, Monterrey in 1770, and San Francisco in 1776. Soon there were nine Franciscan missions in Alta California thanks to the untiring priests, incorporating a big territory to the crown of Spain. Around the missions soon cities started to grow, and colonists from Spain arrived.;x

EVENTNAME285094;The end of the galleys;x
EVENTHIST285094;The prestige gained at Lepanto, allowed the Mediterranean galley fleets of Spain to survive past their usefulness. To man them, the Spanish Justice automatically exchanged the death penalty for 10 years as a galley conscript forming part of the chusma (rowing gang). Both penalties were equivalent, as nobody could survive ten years as a galley oarsman due to the appalling conditions. Lesser crimes could net the offender with a minimum of two years service. Already in mid 1600s, the Navy High Command started to reject the use of galleys in combat as they simply could not face a ship of the line and survive. However the Justice Department demanded their use as floating labor prisons for their supposed deterrent effect on crime. When the decadent Spanish Navy was reorganized by the Marquis of Ensenada and converted back into a first rate Navy, it was clear that the remaining galleys had to be disposed of, and in the Royal decree of March 12, 1771 it was ordered that the punishment in galleys had to be exchanged by forced labor in the Shipyards. But the Justice Department would still have it their way, and the decree was suspended in 1785 with the galley conscription restored. The Navy then decided to stop maintaining the existing galleys and did not build any new one, so in a few years they were all decommissioned, and a new Royal decree on December 30, 1803 finally abolished the galley punishment for lack of galleys. After more than three thousand years reigning in the Mediterranean, the galleys were finally gone.;x

EVENTNAME285095;Submission of the national Church;x
EVENTHIST285095;It was a constant for Catholic monarchs to attempt to reduce the power of Rome in their countries. The justification for this struggle was the belief that the right to rule as monarch emanated directly from God, cornerstone of the Feudal system, but it was a fight for power and money. The means to achieve this independence from Rome were the regalias extracted from the Pope when the King was in a position of strength. The main regalias were the Royal patronage and the Royal exequatur. The exequatur allowed Kings to intervene in the application of Pontifical decisions, while the patronage gave them the right to decide in the distribution of Church money and fill vacant positions with their candidates. Fernando the Catholic, after a long struggle, obtained the control of the Church of the Americas, while Carlos I and Felipe II obtained important regalias. With Felipe V, the pro-Habsburg Church and the Bourbon King clashed to the point of reaching a suspension of relations in 1709. But the papacy of the eighteenth century was in no position to contest the growing independence of the temporal powers, while the revival of Spain under the Bourbons rendered hopeless any struggle against the resolve of the monarchs to regulate the internal affairs of the Kingdom. On January 11, 1753, Fernando VI and Pope Benedict XIV signed a concordat re-establishing relations. The Concordat of 1753 awarded the King of Spain Universal Royal Patronage, and reserved for the Pope the right to name only 52 ecclesiastical positions in the Spanish empire, none outside of Spain. The high-ranking Churchmen knew very well to whom they owed allegiance from then on.;x

EVENTNAME285096;The Kingdom of Naples and Sicily;x
EVENTHIST285096;In the war of Polish succession Felipe V of Spain supported France in her fight against Austria and Russia in order to make the French candidate to be elected as King of Poland. He hoped in this way to secure Mantua for the elder son, Don Carlos, who, already Duke of Parma as Carlo I, had also the expectation of Tuscany and to give the Kingdoms of Naples and Sicily to the younger son, Don Felipe. Since Austria was fighting on several fronts on the Rhine against France and on Lombardia against Savoy, Spain easily conquered Naples and Sicily which Austria had previously occupied during the war of Spanish succession. In 1735 the peace treaty that followed the war of Polish succession established that Felipe's son Carlos (later Charles III of Spain) should give up the duchy of Parma, which he had inherited in 1731 as descent of the Farnese family through his mother, Elisabetta Farnese, Queen of Spain and any claim to Tuscany, given to the Duke of Lorraine after Gian Gastone, the last of the Medicis, died. In exchange for that, Don Carlos was confirmed the possession of his conquests in Southern Italy. On 3 October 1735 Don Carlos, named Carlo VII King of Naples and Carlo V King of Sicily, established the cadet line of the Spanish House of Bourbons in the Kingdoms of Naples and Sicily (renamed Kingdom of Two Sicilies after 1815).;x

Charles V used his strengthened political influence to definitely settle the Italian balance of powers and the conflicts between the Italian minors that deceitfully used to switch sides between France and the Empire. According to Mercurino da Gattinara's advices Charles V granted independence to all the imperial fiefs and, with the mediation of Pope Clemens VII, even to Francesco Sforza who was reinstated in his duchy in spite of his joining the league of Cognac. Pope Clemens VII instead, receiving the territory of Parma was to renounce his claims to Modena and Ferrara and to promise to arrange for a Concile in the next future to discuss about the Reform of the Church. Settled the political affairs in the peninsula, Charles was crowned by Pope Clement VII King of Italy on 22 February 1530 and Holy Roman Emperor two day later, in two solemn ceremonies arranged in Bologna. The imperial crown was a really big gift for his 30th birthday: Charles V resulted, in facts, the last Holy Roman Emperor in history to be personally crowned by the Pope.;x

EVENTHIST285110;At Francesco II Sforza's death, the Duchy of Milan reverted to the Empire and as Charles V newly rejected the French Orléans candidature to the Milanese throne, François Ier, King of France, planned a new military campaign in Italy against Charles V, this time with the help of the Turk. At first the French King attacked Savoy, because Duke Charles III refused French military access through his possessions, and annexed it with the assertion he had a dynastical claim to it. Deeply annoyed by this behaviour, Charles V sent an expeditionary force to conquer Provence, once imperial land. The expedition unfortunately failed while the scary Ottoman menace over Italy led Pope Paulus III to warmly invite the two contenders to make peace and form a Christian league in order to face the Turks. In 1538 in Nice a decennial truce was concluded with Papal support. But that cease-fire couldn't last too long. In 1542 Milan had to face a new French attack which resulted in an imperial heavy defeat at Ceresole in Piemonte, but although northern Italy totally fell under French control, at the same time English and Spanish-Imperial troops attacked France from both sides: even Paris was under menace. Lack of supplies and low troops reinforcements brought Charles V to eventually sign a peace treaty with François Ier at Crépy in late 1544. With that treaty France was recognized possession of Piemonte, still under French control and in spite of Savoyard legal claims to those lands, instead the Emperor was confirmed suzerainty over the duchy of Milan. That treaty also stated that François Ier had to renounce his claims to Naples, Flanders and Artois, while Charles V had to abandon any claim to the duchy of Bourgogne, ancestral Burgundian feud. It was also agreed that a diplomatic marriage had to be arranged between the youngest of François's sons, Charles Duke of Orléans and, either the Emperor's daughter (bringing Flanders and Franche-Comté as dowry) or the Emperor's niece and Ferdinand's daughter (bringing Milan as dowry). That would be by Emperor's choice. After two month's thoughts, Charles V decided to concede his daughter as spouse to Charles of Orléans, together with the dowry of Milan. However, in late 1545 the sudden death of Charles of Orléans liberated Charles V from the treaty's obligations and on 5 July 1546 he could invest his son Don Felipe with the Duchy of Milan. With this act, the imperial fief of Milan became definitively direct dominion of the Spanish line of the House of Habsburg.;x

The arrival of a new viceroy in April 1520 precipitated the confrontation, and the guilds took control of Valencia. Soon battles erupted between the Germania and the nobles, spreading to Murcia and Mallorca. The Germania had also a marked anti-Muslim component, attacking the moriscos, sometimes forcing them to convert. This also eroded the economical power of the nobility, as the moriscos were their indentured serfs, and once converted they were freed from servitude. The King did not do anything, letting the nobles deal with the Germania. By March 1523 the Germania had been crushed and hundreds executed. The next year Charles issued a General Pardon.;x

Although defeated in February 1521, they recovered soon, and on April 23, they crushed the Comuneros army at Villalar executing their leaders the following day. By February 1522, the last Comuneros surrendered and Carlos could afford to be magnanimous and issued a General Pardon to all but the main leaders. Carlos returned to Spain in 1522, married an Iberian woman, Isabel of Portugal, and appointed Spanish nobles to government. These were many of the Comuneros demands, but they were done on Carlos terms, after humbling the cities and restoring his relationships with the nobles.;x

Six hundred copies were issued, and found their way to the principal libraries of Europe, where they had considerable influence on subsequent editions of the Bible. Meanwhile, the University and the city around it developed. The University of Alcalá (Complutensis, from the Latin name of Alcalá, Complutum) would soon become one of the main European universities and the main focus of intellectual activity in Spain.;x

EVENTNAME285118;The testament of Isabel;x
EVENTHIST285118;On November 26, 1504 Isabel died, after leaving the Kingdom to her daughter Juana, but entrusting the government to her husband Fernando in case she was incapacitated, as she showed mental instability. The Kingdom got split between partisans and opponents of Fernando. The King of Aragon decided to leave Castile, even though the new Kings, Felipe I and Juana, had not arrived yet from Flanders. But when Felipe died soon after his arrival, Cisneros became the Regent of Castile with the goal of obtaining the return of the King. Fernando, King of Aragon, became then Regent of Castile in the name of his now mad daughter, and rewarded Cisneros with the Cardinalate. In her testament, Isabel had asked her heirs not to abandon the conquest of Africa. The Kings of Castile had reclaimed their right to the integration of Mauritania Tingitana (then Fez and Tlemcen) since Alfonso XI because it was part of the Hispanian diocese, and Tangier had been a Visigothic province. Already Melilla had been occupied by the Duke of Medina-Sidonia in 1497. The question was if embarked as she was in the conquest of America and Italy, Spain could afford to conquer also North Africa. Cisneros wanted to pursue Isabel's wishes, while Fernando was more practical.;x

EVENTNAME285119;The conquest of Mazalquivir and Oran;x
EVENTHIST285119;Before leaving Castile, Fernando gave Cisneros permission to attack Mazalquivir (Mers-el-Kebir), the port of Oran (Wahran). His motivation was the security of his Italian possessions from Barbary attacks. The Spanish expedition, with the costs advanced by Cisneros and under naval command of Ramón de Cardona, and land command of the Alcaide de los Donceles captured the fortress after a heavy bombardment. But Mazalquivir was difficult to hold, as it lacked water and had to be provisioned by dangerous sorties or by friendly tribes. After the return of Fernando, Cisneros lobbied indefatigably for another expedition to Oran. Fernando, who owned his post as Regent of Castile to him, agreed when Cisneros offered to finance the expedition. Command of the expedition was entrusted to Pedro Navarro, and it was carried out under the direct supervision of Cisneros, and under his personal banner. The Spaniards landed an army of over 20,000 men and besieged the city. Navarro soon blew the walls with his mines and heavy artillery bombardment, and in the assault the Spaniards inflicted 4000 casualties in the enemy, and conquered the city. Cisneros wanted to push the conquest inland, but Navarro, under orders from the King, refused. For almost 300 years, Oran and Mazalquivir would remain in Spanish hands.;x

Navarro disembarked 5,000 men and a train of artillery, and after defeating a far more numerous Berber army, conquered the city sacking it. Since it was still early in the season, Navarro decided to attack Tripoli. An army of 14,000 men was prepared. The second Duke of Alba, García de Toledo, son of the conqueror of Navarre, and father of the famous third Duke of Alba, took command of the expedition. The city, the strongest in the campaign, was taken by assault, with over 5,000 casualties between the defenders. Immediately Navarro and Alba went to Djerba with the intention of capturing the island. After landing, they were ambushed in an oasis and 3,000 soldiers and the Duke of Alba were killed. Navarro returned to Tripoli. The Zayyanid sultan of Tlemcen, Abu Abdallah Muhammad VIII, worried by the continuous defeats decided to become a vassal of Spain in 1510.;x

EVENTHIST285122;Fernando had agreed to Cisneros's policy of North African expansion to provide an alternative route to Sicily, and to squash piracy in the Barbary coast. However the conquest of isolated presidios (fortresses) in the coast had the exact opposite effect. Under the pressure of Spain, the authority of the Zayyanid rulers of Tlemcen was weakened, and pirates became independent and more active all along the coast. A Turkish pirate of name Aruj, who had become famous, received permission from the Hafsid sultan of Tunis to use the island of Djerba (Gelves) as a base, and he captured Jijelli in 1514 and took over Algiers in 1516 when he defeated the Spaniards. He then killed the local ruler and proclaimed himself sultan. He was known as Baba Aruj, or father Aruj. This was translated by the Spaniards as Barbarroja (Barbarossa in Italian, or Red beard). He became the nightmare of the Spaniards. In 1517 he supported a rebellion in Tlemcen, taking over it, but he was driven out by the Spaniards and killed in 1518. However the balance of power in Tlemcen was shifting towards Algiers, that continued independent under the leadership of Aruj's brother, Khayr ad-Din Barbarossa, who sought the help of the Ottoman Empire.;x

EVENTNAME285123;Generous offer to the Hospitallers;x
EVENTHIST285123;When the Order of St. John was expelled from Rhodes in 1523, it underwent a crisis. Their possessions were being confiscated all over Europe, by both Catholic and Protestant rulers, their income was shrinking and their recruits stopped coming. They desperately needed a base, preferably by reconquering Rhodes, otherwise an island in the Aegean, but no one would help and Venice actively opposed them. Europe was at war and there was no place for their neutrality. The Emperor Carlos however came up with a master idea. He offered Malta to the Hospitallers. Malta was difficult to defend from the growing Ottoman power, but the Knights were a tough breed. They would give their lives defending his shipping lines to Sicily. In 1524 the Hospitallers sent a commission to Malta. Their report was very negative. The island could not sustain itself and the defences were very poor. Then Carlos decided to include Tripoli as part of an all or nothing deal. The Knights thought even less of Tripoli. They did not have the resources to upgrade its defenses. But having no other option, the Chapter General decided in 1527 to accept the offer despite the opposition of the French Langues. They still had hopes of recovering Rhodes, but in 1530 they gave up and moved to Malta, taking possession also of Tripoli. From then on, the Spaniards and the Knights of St. John would fight their battles in North Africa together.;x

EVENTHIST285126;Christopher Columbus's 1493 letter from Lisbon announcing the success of his voyage westward across the Atlantic Ocean quickly became one of the earliest 'best sellers' of European publishing. No less than eleven editions were published in 1493! They were issued across western Europe, in Spain, Italy, France, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. Six more editions were published in 1494-97. Everybody was eager to learn about the new lands across the sea, and the letters of Columbus and Amerigo Vespucci, the 1516 'De orbe novo decades' of Pedro Mártir de Anglería, and the 1535 'Historia general de las Indias' of Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo, contributed to change the perception of the world that Europe had. But more profound changes were about to come. Already Columbus brought a pineapple to King Fernando in his first voyage, and they would be followed by maize and potatoes, that with a caloric yield per cultivated surface double to that of wheat, would trigger an unprecedented population growth. The Columbian exchange drastically altered both worlds, but at the time it also greatly contributed to the prestige of the Spanish monarchy, that after unifying two powerful countries, and expelling the Muslims from Western Europe, had discovered a New World.;x

Against them were 540 knights, 400 Spaniards and 4,000 Maltese. Fort St. Elmo lasted 5 weeks of furious fights until almost all its defenders were killed. By then 600 Spaniards from Sicily had arrived to the city. The fighting continued all summer taking the lives of 5000 defenders with the Turkish loses three times higher, including the famous pirate Dragut.

The Ottomans were calling to the doors of Vienna, and in Africa they had taken over Egypt, and with the help of the Barbary pirates, they were taking over Kingdom after Kingdom, destroying the policy of alliances that his grandfather Fernando had established. He could not let them reach the strait of Gibraltar. Worse still, they entered an alliance with France, so he was facing a simultaneous war in all fronts. To add to that, the Spanish presidios (fortresses) in Africa were very difficult to defend. When Barbarossa conquered Tunis in 1534, the fleeing Pasha al-Hassan went to the Spanish court and asked for help in exchange for vassalage. Carlos could not let the Ottomans or their allies come any closer to Spain and Italy. A huge armada was assembled and he decided to lead it in person.;x

The Turks usally sent their fleets to ravage his coasts, coinciding and even coordinating with French attacks. To avoid complete Ottoman control of the Mediterranean, he took Tunis in 1535. The new Governor of Oran, Martín Alonso de Cordoba, the Count of Alcaudete, was ordered to lead an expedition against Tlemcen, that was shifting towards the Ottoman side. At Prevesa, in the Albanian coast, the combined fleets of Spain, Venice, Genoa and Papal States under command of imperial admiral Andrea Doria, were defeated by the Ottoman-Barbary fleet under Khayr ad-Din Barbarossa. Although loses were small and mostly Venetian, since Doria refused to fight, its effect was to give supremacy in the Eastern Mediterranean to the Ottomans. Besides the expedition of Alcaudete, something needed to be done to maintain Spanish supremacy, at least in the Western Mediterranean, and so Carlos ordered a naval expedition against Al-Djazaîr (Algiers).;x

Spanish count of Alcaudete, military governor of Oran, joined in 1535 with tribal chief Ibn Radwan to help Zayyanid prince Abdallah overthrow his older brother Muhammad V. The expedition, including 600 Spanish soldiers, was almost completely wiped out by the Banu Rashid tribe. However, probably because the Spaniards had taken Tunis, Sultan Muhammad agreed to pay tribute to Oran in exchange for Spanish protection. Six years later, the expedition of more than four hundred ships sent against Barbarossa in Algiers, departed too late in the season, and surprised by a storm, lost one fourth of its effectives, having to retreat. Overstretched because of the wars of religion, and the wars against France, Carlos did not have the resources to maintain the hegemony in the Western Mediterranean against the Ottomans.;x

The most destructive raid was the one produced after the invasion of Milan by France in 1542. Barbarossa, on command of a huge Ottoman and Barbary fleet, raided the coasts of Italy, joining later a French fleet under command of the Duke of Enghien at Marseilles and both proceeded to attack Nice. At the arrival of Andrea Doria and Alfonso de Avalos, they retreated to Toulon for winter, where the churches were prohibited from ringing their bells, and Christian slaves were openly sold between Turks and pirates. While at Toulon, a fleet was dispatched to sack the coasts of Spain.

Alcaudete attacked in 1547, but was driven back by the Turks. Meanwhile, in Morocco, the pro-Turkish Wattasid sultan Ahmad, was defeated by the Sa'did Muhammad al-Shaykh (al-Mahdi), who then invaded Tlemcen putting and end to 300 years of Zayyanid rule there.

However in 1551 they were attacked by a huge Ottoman army under command of Sinan Pasha and Dragut. There were very few Knights in Tripoli, and the Spanish soldiers from Calabria refused to fight, and so Tripoli was surrendered almost without fight. In 1560 the Grand Master Jean Parisot de la Valette enticed the Viceroy of Sicily, Juan de la Cerda, Duke of Medinaceli to attempt its recovery, but the expedition, approved by Felipe II, was a complete failure, since Tripoli had been converted into a stronghold by huge Ottoman defensive works under the direction of Dragut.;x

However the Ottoman sultan Suleiman dispatched spies that assassinated Muhammad al-Shaykh in 1557. Having lost this ally for an attack on Algiers, Alcaudete marched with an army of 12,000 on Mustaghanim (Mostaganem) the next year. But tribes and the Turkish forces of Hasan Quru totalling over 70,000 men defeated them. Alcaudete was killed, and his son and most of the army were captured. The next year many of them would abjure from their beliefs to escape slavery. Tlemcen disappeared as a country, firmly in the hands of the pashas of Al-Djazaîr, named by the Ottoman Empire. Tripoli was lost in 1551, Bugia in 1555, and Tunis in 1570. Spain had lost the North African game, but will successfully defend Oran and Melilla from recurrent attacks for centuries.;x

However in 1565 his help was required by the Hospitallers to defend Malta against a combined assault by the Ottomans and Barbary pirates. The victory was very important because it put a clear limit to how far would the Ottoman Empire capable of projecting his power. However the Ottoman Empire was at his peak, as the capture of Tunis in 1569 demonstrated. The capture of Cyprus in 1571, triggered the formation of a Holy League, mainly formed by Spain, Venice and Papal States, with the combined fleet under command of Don Juan de Austria. The interests of Venice and Spain were very different: Venice wanted to recover Cyprus, and Spain wanted to recover her North African presidios, and they could only agree in fighting the Ottoman navy. The ensuing battle at Lepanto was the biggest naval battle in modern times with over 32,000 casualties (by comparison Trafalgar had only 3,000), 25,000 of them in the Ottoman side. The Ottoman fleet was almost completely destroyed. News of the victory were extremely well received by the Christians that suffered the Ottoman and Barbary piracy.

With great effort, the Moriscos rebellion was put down, and the Ottoman fleet defeated at Lepanto. But although Tunis was briefly recovered, it was quickly lost again due to lack of resources. But he was not alone in having problems. The Ottomans defeated at Malta and Lepanto found themselves also overstretched due to their taxing conflicts in Persia. Under these circumstances, Felipe II and Murad III negotiated a series of truces between 1577 and 1581. In these truces Felipe II renounced to Spanish former conquests in North Africa, while the Ottoman sultan renounced to Oran, and to lend help to the Moriscos.

Upon learning this, the bey of Algiers ordered the bey of Mascara, Mustapha ben Youssef, to attack it. With Oran under siege, Luis Manuel Fernández de Córdoba, count of Santa Cruz, was ordered to carry reinforcements to the city.

He ransomed his father's body for 2000 ducats and his brother Martín in 1561 for 23,333 ducats that he obtained from a pillaging expedition into Moorish territory. In 1563, after the failure of Medinaceli in Tripoli, and the loss of Djerba, where Dragut made a pyramid with the skulls of the garrison, the Beylerbey Hassan Pasha, son of Barbarossa, decided to attack Oran. The Ottoman fleet had 32 galleys and 3 French round ships. The army was constituted of 1,000 Spahis, 15,000 Janissaries, and over 12,000 Kabyles and Arabs, contributed by the Sultan of Koukou and the Banu-Abba tribe. The assaults started in April on Mazalquivir, defended by Martín de Córdoba and 200 men. Time after time the Muslims were repelled. The son of the Sultan of Koukou died, Hassan was wounded, but their troops reached the walls of the fortification. On the last assault, on June 7, Martín was also wounded. Then news arrived that a powerful Christian fleet under command of Gian Andrea Doria and Francisco de Mendoza was on its way. Hassan Pasha called for an all out assault, but the Janissaries refused, and he had to escape, leaving behind all his artillery, and having lost 4,000 men, four galleys and the three French transports. Only 130 survivors remained in Mazalquivir. Maintenance of Oran, however, was becoming a burden. The Council of State asked for reports to study the possibility of leaving Oran and keeping only Mazalquivir, but without the first, the second was untenable, and so it was decided in 1574 to keep both. A great investment was made to upgrade the fortifications, designed by Antonelli, and the castle of Santa Cruz was built in 1577.;x

This was the Old Company of the Sea of Naples composed by harquebusiers to fight on board of galleys. In the winter of 1564, spies informed of a powerful Ottoman fleet being readied in Constantinople. On May 18, 1565 their target is revealed when the Janissaries land in Malta. Already two weeks before, Álvaro de Bazán had gone from the strait to Barcelona to embark 4,000 soldiers. The Mediterranean galleys of Gil de Andrade joined him at Palamós, and 1.500 more soldiers were embarked in Genoa. On July 20, they arrived to Naples to embark more forces, and they were in Messina on August 5, for the final assembly with further auxiliary forces. Finally on August 25, the Viceroy of Sicily, García de Toledo, gave the order to depart, arriving to Malta on September 7, forcing the Ottomans to lift their siege on the exact same day they had scheduled their final full out assault on the few defenders left alive. Had they arrived one day later, Malta would have been lost. It was clear to Felipe II that a reaction time of four months was not acceptable, and that Spain could not project her power far away unless a permanent army capable of landing and conducting battles was assigned to the Navy and could be quickly deployed. So in February 1566 he created the Tercio de la Armada del Mar Oceano, or Tercio of the Navy of the Ocean Sea, also known as Tercio de Figueroa for his first Field Marshal, and formed by 6,700 soldiers. harquebusiers from this unit were the first to assault the Sultana, the Ottoman flagship, in the battle of Lepanto, and as a reward, its commander Lope de Figueroa was given the commission to inform the King of the victory.;x

It was impossible for Atahuallpa to understand anything, as it was the first time he saw a book, and the interpreter barely could speak some words of Spanish or Quechua. Irritated, Atahuallpa threw down the Bible and demanded compensation for the plundering of the Spaniards. His act triggered an attack by the Spaniards. 'Santiago! Y a ellos!'

Finally Pizarro took the decision, and a mock trial was set up. Atahuallpa was accused of repeatedly rejecting conversion, incestuous relationship with his sister and killing his brother, all of them true, and sentenced to death. Since he was going to burn at the stake he accepted conversion to avoid a death that would prevent his eternal life, as the one he had given his brother. He was therefore strangled. The King of Spain was highly displeased with the killing of a monarch but it was too late to do anything about it. The decision, however, proved to be strategically correct, as without his emperor the Inca empire collapsed into the hands of the Spaniards.;x

EVENTHIST285155;Hernando Cortes expedition was intended to collect tributes and gather information only, as Diego Velazquez was the -adelantado-, with a royal charter to take possession of new lands. But Cortes was going to seize his chance. In the Mexica lands, the Aztec Tlatoani, or Prime Speaker, Motehcuzoma Xocoyotzin (Angry Lord, Junior) had initiated a power concentration process, effectively becoming an emperor of the triple alliance and imposing the supremacy of Tenochtitlan over Texcoco and Tlacopan, and at the same time expanding the borders of the Aztec Empire. Due to his despotic nature he was impopular, but he was also superstitious. He identified certain signs and the presence of the strange men in the coasts, as the predicted return of the expelled god Quetzalcoatl to reclaim his Kingdom. It was unthinkable to receive the mighty Plumed Serpent with hostility, and Motehcuzoma sent great presents to the conquistadores and requested them not to come to Tenochtitlan. By stimulating their greed, his effect was obviously the opposite, and Cortes skillfully obtained from his men the formal request to direct them in a quest for gold, and they promised him 20 percent of the benefits, after the royal 20 percent was deducted. Cortes founded Veracruz, sent an envoy to the King of Spain with letters, and burnt the ships to prevent the men loyal to Diego Velazquez from returning to Cuba with the news that Cortes had stepped to the other side of the law. Now only the triumph could save him. With 1300 Totonacas allies from Cempoala, the 400 Spaniards interned into the jungle, towards Tlaxcala, a nation subjugated by the Aztecs that could be gained to their side, according to the Totonacas. The Tlaxcalans were divided, but the faction hostile to the Spaniards was defeated in battle, and several thousand Tlaxcalan warriors joined Cortes side. The Spaniards were applying the tactics learned at the war of Granada, use the divisions within the enemy to their favor, and capture the enemy leader, deciding later if it was more advantageous to release him, to keep him prisoner, or simply to kill him. The Indians, weakened by the European diseases and bitterly divided, facilitated the conquest of great empires by very few men in what constitutes one of the most amazing pages of history. After a stop at the ceremonial center of Cholula, where a terrible massacre took place, because the Tlaxcalans had several accounts to settle, the capital of the Empire, bigger than any European city of the time, awaited.;x

EVENTHIST285157;When Hernando Cortes reached Tenochtitlan with 300 Spaniards and 3000 Tlaxcalans, he was received by Motehcuzoma. The Spaniards were horrified by the volume of the human sacrifices of the Aztecs, and overcome by greed over so much gold. Cortes demands on Motehcuzoma to abandon his pagan gods weakened his position as a god himself. Aware of his precarious position Cortes captured Motehcuzoma, but when news arrived that Panfilo de Narvaez had been sent by Diego Velazquez to capture him, he left Pedro de Alvarado in charge and went back with 80 men to Cempoala, where he half-defeated, half-convinced Narvaez army of 1500 men to join him, and then returned to Tenochtitlan with additional Tlaxcalan reinforcements. But in his absence Alvarado had managed to massacre half of the notables of the city, triggering a rebellion. Cortes exhorted Motehcuzoma to appease his subjects, but these killed him out of rage for being on the Spaniards side. Cortes understood that they had to retreat to Tlaxcala, but the secret nightly escape was discovered and 800 Spaniards and 5,000 Indian allies were killed, while the rest narrowly escaped, Cortes losing two fingers, in what was to be known as the Noche Triste (Sad Night), June 30, 1520. The time for diplomacy was gone. For a year Cortes sought new allies and reorganized and trained a new army, building ships to be transported and mounted in the lake, to siege and attack the water surrounded city, and in June 1521 he was back. In a month and a half the resistance was overcome, the city demolished, and the Empire won. Except for some guerrilla fighting in the mountains, the Aztecs bowed to their new master. When the Consejo de Indias learned of the conquest of the immensely rich empire, they dismissed Diego de Velazquez charges against Cortes.;x

EVENTHIST285160;The new Emperor Manco Inca, was in fact a prisoner in his own palace, humiliated by the Spaniards. As the atrocities against his people became known to Manco Inca, he began to develop a hatred for them. Hernando Pizarro finally restored Manco Inca's freedom and dignity, but it was too late. Villac Umu counseled Manco Inca to send out secret orders for gathering weapons and large crop plantings in preparation for war with the Spaniards. He made his move around Easter 1536. Having won the trust of Hernando, he was granted permission to attend a ceremony northwest of Cuzco, instead he and Villac Umu convened a war council in the mountains. When Manco Inca did not return, Hernando Pizarro realized the mistake he made by letting him go, an Inca counterattack seemed imminent. Soon an army numbering in the tens of thousands was besieging the Spanish held city of Cuzco, and another Inca army was sighted heading towards the Spanish stronghold of Lima. Manco's warriors annihilated every relief column sent from Lima to Cuzco.

And from the south, an angry Almagro was returning from his adventure in Chile, upon learning that his share of the Inca empire consisted of deserts and wasteland.

For Spaniards, fighting Muslims was the natural thing to do if they rejected conversion and they had come all the way around the world to find that Muslims were as close here as they were at home. When they landed at Palawan, then under nominal suzeraneity of Brunei, the governor of Manila, Francisco de Sande, sent the following letter to the sultan of Brunei, Seif ul-Rijal: ''What you are to do is to admit preachers of the law of Christ in all security, and allow any person in your land to freely attend and if he wishes so, to become Christian without any ill befalling him. Further, I desire that you do not sent preachers of the sect of Mahoma to any part of these islands or your own island, inasmuch as the doctrine of Mahoma is false and evil law, and the religion of the Christians alone is true, holy and good.''

The expedition of Esteban Rodríguez de Figueroa, after the invasion of Brunei, succeeded in temporarily vassalizing Sulu, while a attack on Mindanao was mostly unsuccessful. The Muslims in Philippines were also called Moros, as the Muslims in the North of Africa and the Iberian Peninsula were called because of their relationship to the Roman Mauri.

When Japanese ruler Hideyoshi menaced with an invasion of the Philippines, Formosa was considered as a defensive position, and also as an advanced base for commerce with China. The first expedition was sent in 1593, but it wrecked. Dutch presence in the island, and piracy, moved the governor of Philippines to send another expedition under command of Antonio Carreño Valdés in 1626. They founded two forts at Tamsui and Keelung in the Northern part of the island. But their missionary and military work came to an end when the new governor of Philippines decided, in 1635, to stop supporting the colony. The governor of Formosa, Gonzalo Portillo, decided to stay despite lack of support, but diseases and confrontations with natives reduced the size of the colony, and in 1638 Tamsui had to be abandoned. The Dutch governor, Paulus Traudenius, conscious of their weakness, showed up with an army at Keelung in 1642, and the remaining Spaniards and Philippinos agreed to leave.;x

Knowing that, almost all the Guanches had baptized, yet their lords sometimes sold them anyway despite priests protests. The authority of the Peraza in Gomera had been established through a tribal pact with two of the four tribal groups. When Hernán became the lover of Yballa, a young Guanche, he inadvertently broke a tabu, since she was a member of his adopted tribal group, and intermarriage within a group was not allowed to prevent consanguinity. Hernán de Peraza was killed, and the natives rose in rebellion, besieging his wife, who called for help.

From the moment of their conquest, sugar was introduced in the islands, specially in Gran Canaria, Gomera, La Palma and Tenerife. Sugar production attracted many inmigrants from Castile, Aragon, Portugal, Genoa and Flanders, as well as black slaves brought to work on the plantations. Soon there were over 30 sugar mills in the Canary Islands.

EVENTHIST285180;In 1608, by royal charter, the Jesuits were asked to take the task of colonizing and converting the Guarani and Guaycuru Indians in a huge area including Paraguay, Uruguay, North of Argentina and South of Brazil. The Jesuits created a system of missions, called Reductions, because they reduced the dispersion of the natives. About half of the natives joined the Jesuit system. The Jesuits allowed the natives to maintain their culture and language, posession of the land and self-government, in exchange for abandoning polygamy and embracing Christianity and organized work. The system was very successful, and the 60 missions established greatly increased the wealth of the area. However the jesuit system also had enemies in the Indians that rejected any pact with the white men, the hacienda owners with whom the system competed, and the Portuguese slave traders. 23 Jesuits paid with their lives their missionary work, but not one of them was killed by the indians that voluntarily entered the Reductions system.;x

EVENTNAME285181;Bandeirantes;x
EVENTHIST285181;The Bandeiras were armed expeditions privately funded by the Portuguese of Brazil to make incursions beyond the Treaty of Tordesillas line. Usually they went into the jungle and enslaved any Indian they could capture. With the union of the crowns of Spain and Portugal, the Bandeirantes started to attack also the Spanish possessions north of the Rio de la Plata, knowing that as an internal problem, the King would be more lenient. When the Dutch disrupted navigation in the coasts of Brazil during and after the 20 years truce with Spain, the slave traffic from Africa to the Brazilian plantations stopped. Suddenly the Bandeiras became much more profitable. The missions that the Jesuits had established in Paraguay had attracted tens of thousands of indians and owned hundreds of thousands of cattle and were an easy target. Between 1628 and 1638 the Bandeirantes destroyed ten missions, killing thousands of indians and taking over 25,000 captives of which only one quarter would reach Sao Paulo alive. The entire region of Guayrá was desolated. In 1638 the Superior of the Jesuits, Father Ruiz Montoya, travelled to Spain and submitted 12 petitions to Felipe IV to allow the Indians to be armed with firearms for their defense. Concerns about the safety of Rio de la Plata and Peru if Paraguay fell to the Portuguese, finally moved Felipe to agree. The military instruction of the Indians under three Jesuit ex-soldiers, and 11 Spaniards from Buenos Aires started that same year, and a Bandeirada was defeated at Caazapaguazú, but upon their surrender the Bandeirantes were allowed to retire. Their return to Sao Paulo coincided with the arrival of envoys with royal charters and Papal Bulls against the enslaving of Indians and caused much indignation. The municipal chamber (city council) expelled the Jesuits of Sao Paulo and organized an expedition of 450 Bandeirantes and 2700 Indians under command of Manuel Pires. Father Pedro Romero, the Jesuit commander, had 4200 Guaranies and 300 arquebuses. The Bandeirantes were coming down the River Uruguay and were surprised at the river bend at Mbororé on March 11, 1641. The fight was favorable to the Indians, who had also fortified both shores. The Bandeirantes retreated and dug in, and tried to surrender, but the Indians had had enough, and for days they pursued the fleeing Bandeirantes through the jungle. Few made it back to Sao Paulo.

This fragrant intrusion in the Spanish area was not kindly taken, specially since Sacramento engaged in a most damaging contraband against the Spanish monopoly through Lima. The Governor of Buenos Aires, José de Garro quickly seized the colony with the help of Guarani Indians and captured Lobo, but the colony was returned the next year by the Provisional Treaty of Lisbon of 1681. When Portugal entered the War of Spanish Succesion in 1705, the Governor of Buenos Aires, Valdez de Inclán, captured again Sacramento with Guarani soldiers, but it had to be returned to Portugal once more under the Peace of Utrecht in 1715. In 1724 the Portuguese started to expand in the area, leading the Governor of Buenos Aires, Mauricio de Zabala, to found San Felipe y Santiago de Montevideo in 1726, strongly increasing Spanish control over the Banda Oriental region, or eastern shore of the Rio de la Plata.;x

With a desire to solve the confrontation with Portugal over Sacramento, and on the advice of his Portuguese wife, Barbara de Bragança, he signed in 1750 an agreement to hand over all the lands East of the river Uruguay and North of the river Negro to Portugal in exchange for the colony of Sacramento. The vast region that was to become Portuguese was known as Seven Villages, for the seven Jesuit Reductions that exploited the area.

They were leaded by José Sepé Tiarayú. Against them a Spanish army under Gaspar de Monive, Marquis of Valdelirios, and a Portuguese army under Gomes Freire de Andrade. For two years both armies conducted an inefectual war against the guerrilla tactics of the Indians. Finally in 1756, both armies joined forces, and after the killing of José Sepé, they slaughtered 1300 Indians at Caibaté, suffering four casualties. Soon they took control of the region with a final death toll of about 6000 Indians. These events are narrated in the movie ''The Mission.'' After the campaign, Freire and Valdelirios, wrote letters blaming the Jesuit order for instigating the Indians, and arrested 11 fathers. The matters were investigated by the new Governor of Buenos Aires, Pedro de Ceballos, and by the Jesuit order, whose General Ignazio Visconti had given orders, under penalty of mortal sin, expulsion, and excommunication, of colaborating with the authorities. The investigations did not find any evidence to substantiate the accusations, and the case was superseded to the indignation of Freire and the Marquis of Pombal, Masons and enemies of the order. The Marquis of Pombal took matters into his own hands and wrote a pamphlet entitled ''Brief account of the Jesuit Republic and its war against Spain and Portugal.''

EVENTHIST285185;After the violent expulsion of the Guarani, in 1756, the Portuguese started occupaying the area awarded to them by the Treaty of Madrid, but they never surrendered Colonia de Sacramento to the Spaniards. When Fernando VI died in 1759, the new King, Carlos III, immediately rejected the Treaty as very detrimental for Spanish interests, as Spain had surrendered a big territory for a small settlement that was never paid. In 1761, he obtained from Portugal the annulment of the Treaty. But the next year Spain was forced to enter the Seven Years War in support of France against England. Since Portugal was allied to England, Pedro Ceballos once more conquered Colonia de Sacramento. However since France and Spain lost the war, at the Treaty of Paris in 1763, for the third time Sacramento had to be returned to Portugal, although the area of Seven Villages was recovered. The Indians once more started to return to their lands, but the prosperity of the region had been greatly affected. The final straw was the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1767. Although an attempt was made to preserve their system, the Crown administrators proved less capable and more corrupt than the Jesuits, and had troubles with the Indians, leading to the ruin of the former Jesuit Reductions system in Paraguay.;x

Colonia de Sacramento continuous contraband was a thorn in Spanish colonial monopoly, and Portugal ambitioned the San Pedro region, not recognizing the Spanish right to it. Spain blockaded Sacramento to reduce contraband, further infuriating the Luso-Brazilians. In 1767 they attacked Rio Grande de San Pedro, expelling the Spaniards from the area. Tensions mounted for several years as the Portuguese established numerous ranches in the seized area with stock stolen from the mission estancias. This lead to military build up in the region. But while Spain was trying to reach a diplomatic agreement, the Marquis of Pombal was betting on a military victory. While negotiations were being conducted in 1776, the Portuguese attacked and further pushed the Spaniards South at the disputed border. This deception was the last straw for Spain. A great fleet was assambled, formed by 116 ships and 19,000 men, under command of Pedro Ceballos. To better cope with Portuguese ambitions, the Viceroyalty of La Plata was created, and Pedro Ceballos named first Viceroy. The Ceballos campaign of 1777 was a complete success. He soon conquered the island of Santa Catalina and Colonia de Sacramento, where the Portuguese bastion was leveled. He was going to continue with the conquest of San Pedro when orders arrived from Madrid to stop the offensive. With the death of José I of Portugal, his daughter María had fired the Marquis of Pombal, and desired peace with her uncle, King Carlos III of Spain. The Spanish prime minister, Floridablanca, also wanted a free hand to take advantage of the American Revolution, so a peace treaty was signed at San Ildefonso on October 1, 1777, and confirmed in the Treaty of El Pardo in 1778. Portugal ceded Colonia del Sacramento to Spain, but retained Santa Catalina and San Pedro in exchange for the African island of Fernando Po (now Bioko) and full commercial rights in the African coast between the Niger and Ogoue rivers.

A great fleet was assambled, formed by 116 ships and 19,000 men, under command of Pedro Ceballos. To better cope with Portuguese ambitions, the Viceroyalty of La Plata was created, and Pedro Ceballos named first Viceroy. The Ceballos campaign of 1777 was a complete success. He soon conquered the island of Santa Catalina and Colonia de Sacramento, where the Portuguese bastion was leveled. He was going to continue with the conquest of San Pedro when orders arrived from Madrid to stop the offensive. With the death of José I of Portugal, his daughter María had fired the Marquis of Pombal, and desired peace with her uncle, King Carlos III of Spain. The Spanish prime minister, Floridablanca, also wanted a free hand to take advantage of the American revolution, so a peace treaty was signed at San Ildefonso on October 1, 1777, and confirmed in the Treaty of El Pardo in 1778. But this time Portugal has refused a peaceful solution. Let's retake what it is ours by force.;x

EVENTHIST285188;The Northern part of the Inca domains still carried the scars from its recent incorporation into the Tahuantinsuyo (Inca Empire), followed by its devastating civil war. The Cañaris Indians after being defeated and annexed by Huayna Capac, had taken the side of Huascar, and had suffered almost extermination at the hands of Atahuallpa. The Chachapoyas, Cajamarcas, Chimor, Chancas and Huancas also hated the Inca, and they approached Pizarro, together with some of the defeated Huascar Cuzcans. They were all grateful for the killing of the hated Atahuallpa, and their Curacas (noble leaders) offered their alliance to Pizarro. In the way to Cuzco, more Chachapoyas and Cañaris that had been forcefully relocated there also joined him. The local help would be instrumental in the quick demise of the Inca.;x

EVENTNAME285189;Pueblo revolt;x
EVENTHIST285189;The Pueblo people of New Mexico had accepted Spanish domination because of the protection they awarded against nomadic Navajo and Apache raids. However there was religious friction due to Franciscan pressure to the Pueblo to abandon their Pagan beliefs. In 1670, a great drought brought famine and Apache attacks on such a scale that the Spanish soldiers could not cope. Unsatisfied with the Spanish inability to feed and protect them, the Pueblo Indians turned to their old gods, provoking a repressive wave from the Franciscans. In 1675, 47 medicine-men were arrested on charges of witchcraft, and three of them were hanged. The Pueblo uproar for the events coincided with most of the soldiers being away fighting the Apache, so the rest of the medicine-men had to be released, between them one named Popé. Later, when fugitive from murder accusations, Popé took refuge in Taos and prepared a revolt. On August 10, 1680 Popé directed the uprising of the Pueblo, killing 18 Franciscan priests, and over 380 Spaniards between men, women and children. The survivors took refuge in Santa Fe, and when besieged, escaped to El Paso. Until his death in 1688, Popé ruled the Pueblo with an iron fist, trying to erase any sign of Europeans. Under penalty of death, the Pueblo Indians had to destroy all signs of Catholic religion and Spanish culture, including the killing of Spanish imported livestock and burning of fruit trees, and they were forbidden from growing barley or wheat.;x

This power struggle plus a prolonged drought and increased Apache attacks weakened the Pueblo and prepared the stage for the Spanish return. In July 1692, Diego de Vargas Zapata, recently appointed Governor of New Mexico, arrived with less than 50 soldiers. Through skillful diplomacy, he was able to entice the far more numerous and fortified Pueblo Indians in Santa Fe to surrender without firing a shot. The Spanish conceded a measure of freedom of religion and culture to the Pueblo Indians, granting large portions of land to the different Pueblos and appointing public defenders to protect the Indian rights at Spanish courts. A second uprising in 1696 that resulted in the death of 5 missionaries and 21 Spaniards had to be put down with more violence, but New Mexico was essentially reconquered by the end of the century.;x

EVENTNAME285191;Cuerno Verde;x
EVENTHIST285191;Starting in 1719, a new Indian nation appeared in the plains bordering New Mexico. They were a branch of the Shoshone, and were the first native nation to use extensively the horse that made the buffalo culture possible. Besides hunting and trading, they also depredated all the rest of the Indian tribes and Spaniards, driving the Apache southward and the Ute westward. They mounted regular large scale raids that stole just about every horse and mule in New Mexico and Northern Mexico, and put a good dent in the available supply in Texas. They also captured women and children as slaves. When the Spaniards inquired about their name to the Ute, the answer was Kohmahts (those who are against us), interpreted by the Spaniards as Comanche. In the 1770s the Jupe Comanche were leaded by a charismatic chieftain, Cuerno Verde (Greenhorn), and his attacks put the Spanish frontier at the brink of collapse. Juan Bautista de Anza, had been made Governor of New Mexico after his famous land expedition to Monterey (California), and he understood that peace with the Comanche could not be achieved unless Cuerno Verde was defeated. He led an expedition in 1779 with 600 soldiers, militia and Pueblo Indians. He was later joined by 200 Ute and Apache against the common enemy. After a surprise attack from the North, the Spaniards killed Cuerno Verde and 50 comanche warriors. With his death the Comanche were ready to sign a peace with Spain, but were still at war with the Ute. Anza mediated between the Ute and the Comanche and finally achieved a permanent peace treaty between the Comanche and Spain and the Ute in 1786. This peace treaty would last until the end of the Spanish presence in North America.;x

Although the Spaniards suffered a few setbacks, for the most part of this phase of the war they were victorious and by 1570 the Arauco was apparently pacified by Pedro de Villagra and Rodrigo de Quiroga. One of García Hurtado's captains was the poet Alonso de Ercilla, who wrote his masterwork La Araucana based on these events.

Meanwhile the Jesuits were trying to convince the government that Indian resistance was due to Spanish repressive methods. It was worth trying, so the mystic father Luis de Valdivia was authorized in 1612 to promise the Araucanians peace and Spanish retreat from their lands in exchange for accepting missionaries. Obviously as soon as the military left, the missionaries were cruelly put to death. By 1626, it was clear that the defensive war proposed by the Jesuits was a complete failure and was abandoned. However plagues and racial mixing were slowly reducing the Araucanian resistance.;x

They were Nikolaus Federmann (Nicolás Federman), Georg von Speyer (Jorge de la Espira) and Philipp von Hutten (Felipe de Utre). They conducted several German explorations departing from Santa Ana de Coro (Tocuvo) and became embroiled in the myth of El Dorado, but found no riches, and many of the Germans found death in the jungle.

Rumiñavi died without saying a word, but one of the captives spoke of a region towards the North, where a very rich chieftain used to cover himself in gold powder before bathing in a sacred lake to which gold offerings were also thrown. The name of the chieftain was El Dorado, or the gilded one.

EVENTHIST285197;The legend of El Dorado became the personal obsession of Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada, a lawyer turned into conquistador, that in 1536 departed Santa Marta in the Northern coast of Colombia with 900 men towards the interior. The expedition was epic due to the difficulties found, and finally 178 men under his command reached the valleys inhabited by the Muisca, also called the Chibcha. They were one of the most advanced cultures in América, and extremely rich due to their mining of emeralds, copper and salt, that traded for gold to other tribes. In one year Quesada and his band had conquered the estimated one million Muiscas using the tipical conquistador tactics of using internal divisions and seizing the zipa (ruler) and using him as a puppet before putting him to trial and executing him. The treasure seized was amazing, and third only to the Aztec and Inca treasures. The royal fifth amounted to 70 kg of gold and 576 emeralds. However Quesada, now inmensely rich but with troubles with the authorities due to his mistreatment of the Indians, was convinced that this treasure was only a small part of what he could get if he was capable of finding El Dorado.;x

EVENTHIST285198;In search of El Dorado departed Pedro de Ursúa from Peru in 1560, down the rivers Marañón, Amazon and Orinocco, but he was killed by his second Lope de Aguirre and the expedition went rogue, commiting all kind of crimes until they were all killed in Venezuela. The obsession of Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada with El Dorado led him to obtain permission for a new expedition in 1569, putting his huge personal fortune in the line to finance it. The expedition departed with 400 Spaniards, 1500 Indians and 8 priests, and returned empty-handed in December 1572 with 64 Spaniards, 4 Indians and 2 priests, being one of the most expensive disasters in the Spanish conquest, almost ruining Quesada. But these two disastrous expeditions did not kill the myth. When it became evident that El Dorado was not to be found in Nueva Granada (Colombia), it was simply moved to the last unexplored part of the continent, the Guiana, where the last person to look for it was Sir Walter Raleigh who conducted two failed expeditions in 1595 and 1616. After that, the myth was finally put to rest, but in 1856, the drainage of the Siecha lake, in Muisca territory, allowed the discovery of a gold boat with ten figures, one of which was a chieftain. The gold boat, now in the Bogotá museum, proved that the ceremony that gave origen to the myth was authentic, and that Quesada found El Dorado without knowing it.;x

It was supposedly introduced to european medicine in 1640 by the countess of Chinchón, even before botanists had identified and named the species of tree. Quinine bark was used by the jesuits in South America very early in its history and due to the influence of the Company of Jesus, the newly named 'Jesuit's powder' became known all over Europe.

Starting from his base in Messina he then tried to reconquer his Kingdom with an Aragonese army led by general Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba. After an initial defeat against the French in the battle of Seminara, the King organized a fleet and, supported by the local population which was hostile to the presence of French troops, entered Naples retaking the castles which were still in French hands. Although having successfully helped his cousin Ferrandino, Ferdinand of Aragon distrusted Ferrandino's uncle Federico who succeded to the throne because of lack of Ferrandino's direct descendancy. Federico was a weak monarch whose unhappy diplomatic moves to appease France, even acknowledging his realm as a French fief, and to encourage diplomatic relations with the Turk would let the Kingdom be prey of foreign powers. Ferdinand of Aragon, who didn't deny to disconfess Alfons V's testament to keep the crown of Naples separate from those of Aragon and Sicily, feared that the defense of Naples, crucial to the Aragonese trading in the Mediterranean, could no longer be entrusted to his relative. He had to face the difficult choice of either going to war against France or splitting the Kingdom of Naples with them. When Federico refused a marriage between his son Ferrandino, Duke of Calabria, and Ferdinand's niece, Juana de Aragón, King Ferdinand definitively resolved to come to terms with the French King signing the treaty of Granada.

He was related to several royal families in Europe, but after the death of the designated heir, Joseph Ferdinand Wittelbach of Bavaria, at the age of six, the royal houses of Austria and France had a similar claim, although according to the Spanish laws of succession the right of the French Dauphin preceded that of the Habsburg. But both nations were too powerful, and the addition of the Spanish empire would make any of them unstoppable, and so candidates not destined to their thrones, Philip of Anjou and Charles Habsburg, were discussed as heirs to Carlos, and several partition agreements were negotiated. That is precisely what everybody wanted to prevent in Spain. Despite the bigger influence from the Austracist party led by the mother of Carlos, historically there was an undisputable fact: France had 300,000 soldiers next to Spain and the Spanish Netherlands, and so represented the only opportunity, albeit small, to keep the empire together. A will was redacted and the agonizing Carlos signed it. It bequeathed the Kingdom to Philip Anjou, but it contained two crucial clauses, the condition that the crowns of France and Spain should never be held by the same person, and the condition that if any partition took place, then the crown of Spain should go to Charles Habsburg. Austria, of course, rejected it, starting the war in Italy, but the rest of Europe seemed to agree, as the equilibrium was not broken. But, could Louis XIV resist the temptation?;x

Although there were supporters for both monarchs in all regions of Spain, the disenchantment with the Habsburg rule and the admiration for the French centralized model was higher in the former Kingdom of Castile, while in the former Kingdom of Aragon, besides the opposite sentiment, there was a profound hatred of the French for the loss of the Roselló and the bombardment of Barcelona by the French fleet a few years before. The arrival of the Archduke to the coasts of Valencia raised most of the province in his favor, and after the conquest of Barcelona by the English troops, and with the Archduke Charles in the city, most of Catalonia declared her support for him, and he was proclaimed King by the parliament on November 7, 1705.

EVENTHIST285215;The Spanish war of succession was also slow to end. Since Spain and Austria had not settled the issue and it was impossible to reach an agreement between all participants, it was decided that separate peace treaties between the parties would end the war. This decision was very damaging to Spain that was left with very little negotiating power once France left the war, and that was left at the hands of a foreign King whose main interest was to win the crown of Spain and had little interest in maintaining the Spanish possessions. The series of treaties received the name of Peace of Utrecht. Spain signed a treaty with England on July 13, ceding Gibraltar and Minorca, and a monopoly on slave trade for the next 30 years. The treaty with Savoy on August 13 ceded the island of Sicily, later exchanged by Sardinia with Austria, in exchange for the renunciation of Vittorio Amedeo II to any right to the crown of Spain. The peace treaty with the United provinces had to wait until June 26, 1714, and that with Portugal to February 1715, but both had little consequence. However the war against Austria, now favorable to Spain, continued with the reconquest of Sardinia in 1717 and an attack on Sicily in 1718, until a quadruple alliance was formed by France, England, Netherlands and Austria forcing Spain to accept the loss of Naples, Sicily, Sardinia and Parma at the treaty of the Hague on February 17, 1720 sealing the peace between Austria and Spain. At the Peace of Utrecht, Felipe, as King of Spain, renounced his right to the crown of France, and Charles renounced the crown of Spain.

A string of defeats had the Franco-Spanish armies at the doors of Barcelona, and the English had left the war. In March the empress left Barcelona, leaving Stahrenberg to reach an agreement with Felipe, and after surrendering Tarragona, the Austrians left. On the 9th of July 1713, with the Bourbon armies surrounding Barcelona, the three arms of the Barcelona courts voted on what to do. The military and ecclesiastic branches voted at first to come to terms, but in the popular arm, representing the third state, war was decided by 78 to 45 votes, forcing a turn of the tide for an all-out resistance. With numerous casualties on both sides, the Bourbon armies reconquered Barcelona on September 11, 1714. But the war would not end until June 13, 1715, when the 1000 Austrian garrison surrendered the island of Mallorca. Felipe V became the first King of Spain, instead of King of Castile and Aragon. Since his triumph was due to the loyalty of the Castilians, the coat of arms of Castile and the numbering of her Kings became those of Spain.

EVENTHIST285217;The Spanish Habsburgs, kept the medieval system of Spanish Kingdoms. Each Kingdom, as well as other regions and cities, kept different laws and taxation system. The old Kingdom of Castile was the one that allowed more control to the King, and was the one that in a larger measure paid the price of maintaining the Spanish empire against its enemies. Less than a year after Felipe V was crowned King of Spain, Austria, England, and Holland decided to contest his succession. The ArchDuke Charles Habsburg, the candidate of the coalition, offered the former Kingdom of Aragon to swear and maintain their privileges. That, together with the hatred of the French for the loss of Rousillon, took first Valencia and Catalonia and later the rest of the Crown of Aragon to rise against their King and proclaim Charles as the new King. For the Spaniards it was a civil war between two models of state, the centralized France and the decentralized Austria. Even before the civil war was over, Felipe issued in the already recovered regions of Aragon and Valencia the decrees of Nueva Planta in 1707. The decrees suppressed the medieval kingdoms by abolishing their special laws and parliaments. This move towards centralization allowed for the imposition of a uniform tax system that greatly increased the Crown revenue. The Castilian language was also made official as the Spanish language.

Having proclaimed himself as the only legitimate heir of Charlemagne, the first Holy Roman Emperor, François Ier had announced his candidature to the imperial election. Commonly all the electors were bribed in order to obtain their much desired vote, but Charles 'bought' the Imperial title by paying the Great Electors and their emissaries the huge sum of 850,000 golden florins (equal to a value of 2,100 kilograms of gold). That money was advanced by his bankers in anticipation of several years worth of Castilian rents. Charles's election was also eased by the Army of the Svevian league, which impressed the doubtful electors when chasing the Duke of Württemberg, chief of the pro-French party, out of his duchy. That denied François his last remote chance to win the election. Being elected Holy Roman Emperor as Charles V, Charles (Karl in the German world or Carlos in Spain) of the House of Habsburg became suzerain of all the fiefs in the Holy Roman Empire. Amongst them the Duchy of Milan together with its sovereignty over the Republic of Genoa formed the beginning of the so-called 'Spanish Road' a critical route that allowed communication by land between the Habsburgs's dominions.;x

EVENTNAME285224;The Union of Arms;x
EVENTHIST285224;From the outset of the formation of Spain, Castile was to shoulder the principal burden of the Crown's finances. This in large part was due to the mistrusting nature of the other kingdoms of the monarchy, who were keen to protect their traditional customs and privileges. The other kingdoms had legitimate fears that the Castilian dominated government wished to abolish their traditional laws leading the to be wary of providing financial assistance to the Crown's schemes. By the time of Félipe IV, the Castilian economy was in dire straits and was unable to provide the money and manpower so badly needed by the Crown. Conde Duque Olivares envisioned a strong monarchy that would abolish provincial laws and liberties to establish a unified state. Olivares recognized that such a state could not be achieved in a day but believed small steps should be taken to set the process in motion. In 1624, he proposed a sort of military cooperation between the different provinces, by which the defense of the Spanish Empire would be spread equally amongst the kingdoms. Unfortunately, the Cortes of Aragon, Valencia, and Catalonia, held in the spring of 1626 were even more unenthusiastic about the scheme that Olivares had feared. The Catalans saw the proposal as yet another move in the long standing Castilian conspiracy to steal their liberties. Olivares's scheme was not without small success, as although they rejected his military proposal, the Cortes of Aragon and Valencia were convinced to make annual financial contributions to the Crown.;x

EVENTNAME285227;Duke of Bragança claims Kingdom of Portugal;x
EVENTHIST285227;By the 1640s, the nobility of Portugal were more than just annoyed with their Spanish captivity. None of the supposed benefits of the union with Spain had come to pass. Despite Felipe II's assurances that Spain would respect the Portuguese constitution and its customes, by the time of Felipe IV, taxes were imposed and most all key posts in the government were held by Castilians. Portugal's colonial possessions were also under attack with Spain's enemies, the English and the Dutch. Frustrated by a union that had out lived its usefulness, a group of conspirators began to meet regularly and chose the Duke of Bragança to be their future sovereign. Although a mild-mannered man, the conspiring nobles chose the duke as he had the best claim to throne. Additionally, his confidence was bolstered by his wife, the scheming Luisa de Guzman, daughter of the Spanish Duke of Medina Sidonia. Having orchestrated their rebellion perfectly, the nobles quickly took the palace and the people of Lisbon took control of the city. News of the succesful revolt rapidly spread and one by one the Portuguese defeated the Spanish garrisons. On December 15th of 1640, the Duke and Duchess of Bragança were crowned King and Queen of Portugal.;x

EVENTNAME285230;Military and Naval Reforms of Felipe IV;x
EVENTHIST285230;Humiliated by their failures during the War of the Mantuan Succession, Felipe IV and his favorite Olivares laid down new ordenazas (regulations) for both the army and the navy to increase their effectiveness and to make both types of forces easier to raise and sustain. It is hard to say exactly how effective these were, but it is hard to deny that they didn't make some contribution to the Spanish victories in Southern Germany the following year and to the ability of the Spanish to raise enormous fleets for action against the French and Dutch later in the decade.;x

EVENTNAME285231;Olivares Invests in the Fleet;x
EVENTHIST285231;The impending end of the Twelve Year's Truce with the Dutch meant that more attacks could be anticipated against Spanish colonies and even the treasure fleet. The royal favorite Olivares therefore decided to reinvigorate the long-neglected navy to beat off any such attacks and even possibly to launch equivalent raids against Protestant colonies and fleets. He decided upon a general policy to return the favor to the Dutch that the Spanish had so long enjoyed by destroying the Dutch fishing fleets and attacking Dutch shipping by commissioning privateers, primarily from the port of Dunquerque in Flanders. While the new ships were moderately successful, the ''guerre de course'' was spectacularly successful. Records are fragmentary, but between 1629 and 1638 Dunkirker privateers averaged almost 200 Dutch ships captured each year.;x

EVENTNAME285232;The Spanish Army Mutinies;x
EVENTHIST285232;Spain had enormous problems in financing its wars despite the plentiful gold and silver arriving from the New World in the late 16th Century. Sometimes its troops would go as long as three years without being paid. Eventually the regiment or garrison would mutiny in an attempt to get the money that it was rightfully owed. While rarely over 5000 men ever participated in a single mutiny, they had a huge effect on the Spanish war effort as they often derailed Spanish offensives and the payment of the arrears often consumed a major portion of the entire military budget for that year. It took the Spanish until after the Twelve Year Truce ended in 1621 to figure out how to ensure that its troops were paid in a timely manner.;x

EVENTHIST285240;To the Spanish monarchy, the American war of independence was an opportunity to recover the losses to Britain in the Seven Years War. However opposition to the war within the government and concerns in supporting a colonial rebellion, delayed the entrance of Spain in the war. Cautiously, Spain decided to support the rebels under cover, providing guns, supplies and money. The money was provided through the French government, who conveniently forgot to inform about its origin to the rebels. Meanwhile, preparations for a likely war proceed and Bernardo de Gálvez assambled an army in Louisiana.;x

EVENTHIST285241;The United States of America declared their independence from Britain in 1776.

One of the greatest impacts of the Spanish navy in that war was keeping the British in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico from reinforcing their land troops. Unlike France, however, Spain refused to recognize the independence of the United States. Spain was not keen on encouraging similar anti-colonial rebellions in the Spanish Empire.;x

Taking matters into their own hands one group of unpaid soldiers sacked the towns of Alost and Antwerp in Flanders to get what they felt was rightfully theirs. The barbarity of their conduct earned the incident the nickname ''The Spanish Fury'' and alientated many people in the Netherlands and Europe, Catholic and Protestant alike. It also caused all of the XVII Provinces to sign the Pacification of Ghent that temporarily united the provinces in order to drive the Spanish out of the Netherlands entirely and granted freedom of religion throughout the Netherlands.

Arrival of the French forced de Saboya to withdraw (Peace of Susa Apr 1630), while developments in Germany induced the Habsburgs to sign the Peace of Regensburg (Oct 1630) - reducing Habsburg forces in Italy.

Gonzaga-Nevers was expelled from Italy whilst the senior Gonzaga heiress Maria now wed Guastalla's heir - who became the new Herzog von Mantua and vassal of the Emperador.

Antonio, despised by the nobles because he was an ilegitimate son of D. Luis (son of D. Manuel I) but had great support from the lower classes, and finally, D. Catarina, the Duchess of Bragança. She was the legitimate daughter of D. Duarte (son of D. Manuel I). Although Catarina's claim was the strongest, the Portuguese were not happy with the idea of an independent Queen.

EVENTHIST285281;The Oath of Abjuration or Plakkaat van Verlatinghe, signed on July 26, 1581, was the formal declaration of independence of the northern Low Countries from the Spanish King, Philip II. This act followed the Union of Utrecht. The Oath of Abjuration meant a climax in the Dutch Revolt, a point of no return, in which the Low Countries asserted they were no longer loyal to their King. Sometimes, the oath is interpreted as an act of secession from Spain, but this is strictly speaking incorrect, as the provinces were never legally incorporated into the Spanish Kingdoms, but were only bound to them by the looser tie of personal union. Legally, the oath deposed the provinces' current ruler, Philip of Habsburg - who, by dynastic coincidence, was also King of Spain. Philip's attempts to unify his various realms under a more centralized government based in Madrid were the major drivers behind the oath. Philip used troops from Spain and other areas loyal to him (such as Wallonia and Italy) to fight the rebels. In the Oath, the Staten-Generaal (the General Estates, a sort of federal parliament) assert that a King is a servant of his people and should respect their laws and traditions.

But the Habsburgs were too powerful, and the addition of the Spanish empire would make any of them unstoppable, and so candidates not destined to their thrones, Philip of Anjou and Charles Habsburg, were discussed as heirs to Carlos, and several partition agreements were negotiated. That is precisely what everybody wanted to prevent in Spain. A will was redacted and the agonizing Carlos signed it. It bequeathed the Kingdom to Charles of Habsburg, but it contained two crucial clauses, the condition that the crowns of France and Spain should never be held by the same person, and the condition that if any partition took place, then the crown of Spain should go to Charles Habsburg. Austria, of course, accepted it, gaining the now austrian netherlands and Italy, but the rest of Europe seemed to agree, as the equilibrium was not broken.

Although it is generally considered to be the first directly political act of the Spanish people, it is known that many of Ferdinand's supporters took part in inciting the revolt. The mutiny was initially directed towards the Prime Minister, Manuel de Godoy. Godoy, a former member of the Royal Guard, was highly unpopular with both the Spanish peasants and the nobles. The people were upset at his ambitious nature, his flirting with many women of the court, and his willingness to sign nationally detrimental treaties with France against Great Britain. The nobles were also annoyed at the fact that Godoy had attained enormous power without belonging to their social stratum. Another important factor was the economic crisis that was affecting the country, heightened after Spain lost the core of its navy at Trafalgar in 1805, all but crippling its trade with the American colonies. This caused food shortages and damaged industrial production. Ultimately, the King and Godoy had allowed Napoléon's troops to cross Spain in order to attack Portugal, which wouldn't adhere to the Emperor's embargo on Great Britain. This move was extremely unpopular with the Spanish people, who saw the entry as an invasion, which it would soon become. The French troops rapidly occupied important cities like San Sebastián, Pamplona and Barcelona, thus causing a strong sentiment against the French and Godoy. The uprising itself occurred on March 17th, 1808 in the town of Aranjuez, about 48 km south of Madrid. Members of popular classes, soldiers and peasants assaulted Godoy's residence and captured him, and the King was forced to dismiss him. Two days later, the court forced Charles IV to abdicate and give the throne to his son and rival, Ferdinand VII.;x

EVENTNAME285306;Abdications of Bayonne;x
EVENTHIST285306;Following the national unrest caused by Aranjuez, Napoléon found the overall situation of great interest with regards to his own political machinations, in particular the subjugation of Spain with as few French casualties as possible. Thus, under the false pretence of solving the problem, the Emperor invited both Charles IV and Ferdinand VII to Bayonne in the south of France. Both monarchs were afraid of the Emperor's power and thought it prudent to accept the invitation. However, once in Bayonne, Napoléon forced both Charles and Ferdinand to renounce the throne of Spain and grant it to himself. The Emperor then named his brother Joseph as King of Spain and dispatched him to Madrid at the head of a large French army, in order to establish the new dynasty and invade Portugal. Joseph would, however, leave Spain for good in May 1812, leaving his few remaining supporters, the ''afrancesados,'' to their fate. This episode is known as the Abdications of Bayonne, and paved the way for five years of sporadic, impractical and highly disputed Napoleonic rule in Spain.;x

The tribes acknowledged the sovereignty of the Spanish Crown and were allowed to retain their lands and social structure.

Unfortunately, a powerful economy is not always being represented by a powerful ruler. Expecially the throne of Naples being claimed by two of the most powerful courts in Europe of those times, Spain and France. In his very expensive rush to the leading role of Western Europe still contested by the untamed King of France, the King of Spain eventually made the decision to send troops, officers and insignia to the capital city of the Southern Italian Kingdom in order to press claims on the crown of Naples definitively. Despite Papal firm opposition but in accordance with treaties stipulated with France which stated the definitive Spanish hegemony in the Italian Peninsula, the King of Spain was certain that his move wouldn't have found any local hostility...;x

Charles V conceded him the ducal title again but on the firm condition that on Sforza's death the Duchy would have returned definitely to the Empire. A marriage was also agreed between Sforza and Charles V's niece Christine of Denmark. On 2 November 1535 Duke Francesco II died childless but, in spite of the previous agreements of Bologna, the people of Milan refused Charles V's decision to have the duchy reverted to the Empire but tried to impose self-determination.

EVENTHIST285501;Under the unique colonization model adopted by Spain, the Capitulación, the conquest and colonization was not funded by the state, neither left to the private initiative, nor entrusted to monopolistic trading companies. The Capitulación was a contract by which the State retained full control of the conquest and colonization, that was to be carried out by private individuals under a credit system based on the hypothetical riches to be found. The Adelantado, who had to advance the cost, and was in charge also of colonizing the assigned territory, if succesful received land grants and titles, and retained 4/5 of the bounty to pay the cost and as profit. The crown provided nothing but paperwork. The system proved wildly succesful until it started to create problems to control such huge territory, and was carefully regulated and toned down in the Regulations of 1573. After that date, Capitulaciones became unfrequent.;x

But the new capital lacked a Palace, a central Government building and a proper place for the burial of the new Habsburg dynasty - the Spanish Line. Guided by his profound religiousness and a practical sense, Felipe decided to unite everything in the same place, a monastery dedicated to Saint Lawrence to celebrate the victory over the French at Saint-Quentin on August 10, 1557, that Saint's day. The monastery of San Lorenzo del Escorial took 21 years to complete in the form of a severely rectilinear complex, with numerous internal courtyards, modeled on the grill on which Saint Lawrence was martyred (roasted to death). Despite its Habsburg austere religious style, it contained the best library on old manuscripts after the Vatican Library.

In 1567 its main architect, Juan Bautista de Toledo, died, and was substituted by Juan de Herrera, who gave name to the Herrerian architectonic style characterized by austere straight lines with little ornamentation and the contrast between granite stone walls and black slate roofing. From the monastery of El Escorial, the Spanish Habsburgs ruled their empire. El Escorial lost royal favour when the French Bourbon dynasty, with a more Versaillesc taste, was inaugurated in 1705, but it is still today the royal pantheon.;x

EVENTNAME288000;The rebellion of the Bundschuh;x
EVENTHIST288000;At the end of the 15th century, the situation of the peasants worsened. The lords increased taxes and forced labours and abused of their rights and their prerogatives, which largely dissatisfied peasantry. Many writings and flaming lampoons pushed them to act. Thus, in Sélestat, the movement of the 'Bundschuh' begun, which means lace of shoe into Alsatian in opposition to the lords' boot without the laces. The emblem of the peasant shoe was thereafter taken up again by all the peasants' insurrections in Germany. The leaders of Bundschuh, Hans Ulmann of Sélestat and Jacques Hanser of Blienschwiller, joined together many partisans in Low-Alsace and drew up an action plan in March 1493 at the foot of Ungersberg: abolition of the court of the bishop and the emperor, hunting of the Jews usurers and abolition of the unfair taxes. Having heard about this business, the authorities immediately stopped the insurrectionists and condemned them to death. However, a lot of insurgent could escape and took refuge in Switzerland for most of them where they continued to fight secretly against the oppression of the peasants, regularly starting peasants' revolts in South Germany.;x

EVENTHIST288001;Peasant dissatisfaction persisted in Alsace since the revolt of Bundschuh. The Reform spread quickly in Alsace but in April 1525, severe measurements were taken against the Lutherans preachers by the ecclesiastical authorities. This stirred up a hornet's nest and the revolt broke out, leaving the authorities completely paralysed by its speed. In all Alsace, the peasants raised up against their laic or ecclesiastical lords. They spread of the countryside setting fire on castles, villages, small cities and abbeys which were on their way. Very quickly the peasants organized themselves in bands with at their head Erasme Gerbert of Molsheim. The peasants fought for the abolition of serfdom, the freedom of hunting and fishing, the free use of forests, the suppression of the unfair taxes, the limitation of the forced labour, and the regulation of the census. Strassburg refused to intervene, neither by helping them, nor by fighting them, but the devastating reaction came from the duke Antoine of Lorraine which feared the extension of the revolt in his country. In May, he joined together his army and went on Saverne where the peasants had let themselves lock up. On May 17, 1525, the peasants of Saverne surrendered against the promise of their life saves. They were 20.000... The duke made them all slaughter without pity as their chief, Erasme Gerbert. Then he faced another peasant army close to Scherwiller then turned back to Lorraine. Thanks to the intervention of the duke of Lorraine, Ferdinand of Habsburg could rally an army in Ensisheim, his main town in his Alsatian estates. The revolt was finally definitively put down at the end of the year by Habsburg forces. Soon a terrible repression by the lords begun: imprisonments, executions (more than 10.000 by the court of Ensisheim), increase of the taxes and confiscations.;x

EVENTNAME288002;The Bishops War;x
EVENTHIST288002;In the 16th century, Low-Alsace had two dioceses. The first, that of Strassburg, was a bastion of Protestantism whereas the second, that of Saverne, was a high place of Catholicism. Many quarrels burst between the two religious groups. However, the most important confessionalist crisis took place in 1592 when the episcopal see became vacant again. The chapter of Strassburg elected Jean-George of Brandenburg, 15 year old young man, as episcopal administrator. But in Saverne the Catholics elected Charles of Lorraine, already bishop of Metz. A true war broke out then between the House of Lorraine and Alsatian Protestantism and the town of Strasburg, the Bishops War, which lasted from 1592 to 1604. In spite of many military interventions by the duke of Lorraine, none of the two parties won the war. This war devastated and ruined a great part of the Low Alsace, and especially ruined the town of Strasburg financially. The war ended by the treaty of Haguenau thanks to the mediation of Henri IV of France in 1604. Following this treaty, Charles of Lorraine became bishop of Strasburg, but the Protestants accepted substantial allowances. When Charles of Lorraine died in 1607, Leopold, archduke of Austria and coadjutor since 1595 succeded Charles, extending Habsburg influence in Low Alsace.;x

For many years, he represented the city in all the political and religious conferences and was characterized by his measured and skilful policy, his idealism and his noble views. Lawyer of the union of the Protestants, he defended this cause at many diets where he successfully defended the city, but became also the speaker of other cities, thus ensuring to Strasburg the role of leader. Choosing the side of François Ier and the league of Smalkaden, he could preserve the privileges of the city with the emperor after the defeat of the Protestant princes.

EVENTHIST288005;At the beginning of the 1520's, the writings of Luther and others spread in the city of Strasburg. Priests started to preach the new faith. Bishop and chapter were opposed only slightly, whereas the magistrate sympathized quickly with the Reformers and protected them. In 1523, Martin Bucer, Dominican of Sélestat, married and excommunicated in 1521, settled in Strasburg and proved to be a great defender of the Reform. The magistrate ordered that the sermons were only made in the evangelic spirit, giving to the Reform a nearly legal base. He assumed moreover the right of high monitoring for the faith, and allowed to the Reformists the right of use of the ecclesiastical goods. The adversaries of the Reform were numerous, but they were countered by the magistrate and some were even driven out the city in 1524. The same year, the mass started to be said in German language. Excommunicated by Rome, the Reformers counter-attacked: the churches were taken to the catholics, the catholic worship was abolished, the holy pictures were destroyed, the ecclesiastics were expelled. In spite of the injunctions of the emperor, the magistrate forbade to the Catholics to take part in the mass, even apart from the city. At the diet of Spire in 1529, the representatives of Strasburg were among those which 'protested' against the interdiction of the Reform.;x

The city was directed with prudence by the merchants and got its neighbors' respect. In this favorable context, Strassburg quickly became a major center of Humanism in Europe. Many scientists and artists settled in the city and the most famous was indipustably Gutenberg. After being passaging in Strasburg, the city became the main center of the printers and counted some more than 100 at the beginning of 16th century. Thanks to the many published books, the instruction spread quickly in the population. The city was also used as refuge for various Protestant tendencies and accomodated many craftsmen. The economic advancement went hand in hand with cultural rise. Benefitting from a prosperous agriculture and the revival from the silver mines, as well as the mastery of the Rhine from Basel to Mainz, the city became the center of transit for the goods between Germany and France. Many contemporaries unanimously praised of Strassburg for its richness, its prosperity and its cultural influence.;x

EVENTHIST261005;The feud between Duke Frederick V of Styria and Duke Ulrich of Cilli lasted until 1443, and the fighting in which local nobles, their entourages and foreign mercenaries took part spread over much of Styria and Carniola. Many castles and towns were besieged and destroyed. The troops of the Counts of Cilli even unsuccessfully laid siege to the Carniolan capital Ljubljana. The conflict was solved in 1443 with the signing of several documents: one of them foresaw a mutual inheritance in case one of the families became extinct.;x
#;x
EVENTNAME261006;Death of Duke Ulrich of Cilli;x
EVENTHIST261006;When last Count of Cilli, Ulrich, was killed in Belgrade (1456), Frederick had to fight Ulrich's widow, Hungarian King Ladislaus Postumus, the count of Görz and the Croatian counts of Frankopani for his promised inheritance of Cilli. Unfortunately the region has become volatile once again.;x
#;x
EVENTNAME261007;The stubborn widow;x
EVENTHIST261007;After Ladislaus died in 1457, Frederick III managed to strike a deal with the widow of Ulrich II, Catherine, and the conflict between Austria and Styria was practically settled. The war of succession ended in 1460 with Frederick gaining all the former possessions of the Counts of Cilli.;x

EVENTNAME261010;Death of Ernest the Iron;x
EVENTHIST261010;Although by the treaty of Neuberg of 1379 the Habsburg lands had been partitioned into separate entities, to be held by different members of the Habsburg family, the idea of the unity of the family survived. The most important consequence of this was that by a clause in the treaty in the case of a minor inheriting one of the states the oldest member of the family was to assume tutelage over the minor ruler and regency of his countries. Therefore when Archduke Ernst the Iron of Styria prematurely died in his best manhood in 1424 at the age of 47, and his sons Friedrich and Albrecht were only 9 and 5 years old, their uncle Friedrich IV, Count of Tyrol, became tutor of the two brothers and administered Styria, Carinthia and Carniola not only for them as their tutor, but personally as regent. The large noble dynasties of Styria, especially the Cilli, who quickly rose in power with the close personal friendship of Count Herman II and Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund, used the rather weak central authority during the regency, to enhance their power and autonomy.;x

#;x
EVENTNAME261011;Regency of Herman II of Cilli;x
EVENTHIST261011;Archduke Ernest the Iron was in his best manhood when he passed away in 1424 at the age of 47. His body was interred in the Abbey Reun near Graz. His successors were his three minor sons, Frederic V (*1415), Albert VI (*1418), and Ernest II (*1420). Since Styria was at war with Tyrol, whose ruler Friedrich IV would otherwise, according to Habsburg tradition, be chosen as the guardian of Ernest's sons, the Estates decided to trust the regency to Hermann II of Cilli, member of a noble family of Styrian magnates that was quickly rising in power due to Herman's close personal Friendship with the Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund, whose life he saved in the battle against the Turks at Nicopolis. Thus Herman was made regent of Croatia in 1406, and in 1436 the family was raised to the rank of the princes of state.;x
#;x
EVENTNAME261012;Regency of Friedrich IV, Count of Tyrol;x
EVENTHIST261012;Friedrich IV's regency, during which Styria was governed from Tyrol by a regent whose main interest was to get as much profit as possible for himself out of his office, led to a notable weakening of central power and further strengthened the local noble dynasties and landowners, which led to increased taxes they demanded from their peasants, making the decline of their situation even more rapid.;x
#;x
EVENTNAME261013;Change of regent;x
EVENTHIST261013;Unsatisfied with Friedrich IV's handling of matters in Styria, the estates of Inner Austria decided to entrust the regency into the hands of the Counts of Cilli. In 1437, Emperor Siegmund of Luxembourg, elevated the Counts of Cilli to State Princes. Since Hermann II was the son of Hermann I, Count of Cilli, and his wife was Katerina of Bosnia. The title of Lord of Bosnia was entrusted to the counts of Styria.;x

EVENTNAME261014;Friedrich V comes of age;x
EVENTHIST261014;Friedrich IV, regent for the minors Friedrich V and Albrecht VI, only reluctantly accepted to turn over Styria to his nephews. Usually, regencies in Habsburg lands lasted until the heir had reached adulthood, which was by Habsburg law at the age of 16. However when Friedrich V came of age in 1431, Friedrich IV managed to extend his term until Albrecht VI's 16th birthday in 1435, under the pretext that a possible partition between the two brothers could only be negotiated fairly when both had reached adulthood. Even in 1435, Friedrich IV refused to give up rule of Styria. Only because of the arbitration of Albrecht V of Austria did Friedrich IV finally agree to end his regency on March 25th 1436.;x
ACTIONNAME261014A;Friedrich V becomes Duke of Inner Austria;x

EVENTHIST261015;Friedrich V, later emperor Friedrich III, became of age in 1431, on his 16th birthday, and took up the rulership of Inner Austria, thus terminating the regency of Cilli.;x
#;x
EVENTNAME261017;Treaty with Albrecht VI;x
EVENTHIST261017;Soon after taking over Styria, Friedrich V had to deal with the demands of his younger brother, Albrecht VI, for a part of their father's estate. Their first treaty was concluded on May 13th 1436 in Vienna. By the terms of the treaty, Friedrich remained governor of all of Styria, but had to provide Albrecht with an income sufficient to fund a princely lifestyle. This soon wasn't enough for the extravagant, ambitious and warlike Albrecht.;x

The wars went on, and one by one the Moorish strongholds fell, until only Granada remained in their hands. Málaga was taken (1487) after a long siege by the forces of Ferdinand and Isabella, and in 1492 Granada was recovered.

EVENTHIST3217;Engelbrekt Engelbrektsson is a legendary and enigmatic figure in Swedish medieval history. In 1434 the peasants of Dalarna (The Dales) in Sweden had had enough of union King Erik's crushing taxes and brutal sheriffs. Led by Engelbrekt, the peasants and miners, supported by certain factions within the church and gentry, rose up in open rebellion. They captured castle after castle and soon controlled the greater part of Sweden. Meanwhile, Erik Puke had joined Engelbrekt in revolt in Finland. For two years, Engelbrekt was the de-facto ruler of Sweden, but intrigue among the noblemen and infighting between Engelbrekt, Erik Puke and Karl Knutsson finally resulted in Engelbrekts murder at the hands of Måns Bengtsson Natt och Dag.;x

Defeating the Swedes at Rotebro he marched into Stockholm and was crowned King of Sweden, but only after granting amnesty to Sten Sture den äldre (the elder) and the rebels. This event was called the 'Kalmar Recess'. In 1500, following King Hans's crushing defeat by the peasant rebels in the Ditmarsk, Sten Sture den äldre (the elder) and the Swedish nobles rejected the Kalmar Racess, claiming Hans had not been honoring the agreement. This was to mark the beginning of the end for the Union of Kalmar.;x

This 'Union of Kalmar', at the time the largest state in Europe, was troubled from the start by its loose organization and unbalancing Danish domination. Constant strife in the late 1470's between Sweden and Denmark led to the final dissolution of the Union in 1523, when the national council of Sweden chose the freedom fighter Gustav Eriksson Vasa as King Gustav I (1523-1560), long after Regent Sten Sture den äldre (the elder) of Sweden had defeated the Danes at the battle of the Brunkeberg in 1471.;x

EVENTNAME3223;The Centralization Reforms of Gustav Vasa;x
EVENTHIST3223;Upon his ascension to the Swedish throne, Gustav Vasa was faced with a seemingly endless list of discouraging tasks. The country was in massive debt to the Hansa (which threatened to side with Denmark in its attempts to restore the Union), the nobles were untrustworthy, and the army and navy were in shambles. Worst of all, however, was the unbalanced distribution of land. The crown lands were too small to provide the vital taxes needed to support the state. The King proved up to the challenge, and with unpopular reductions and obsessive micromanagement he got the country back on its feet. In his early reign, Gustav also sought to gain the Skåne counties and Gotland from Denmark with the help of the Hansa. He didn't succeed, but the claim had been staked...;x

He was an able King who reformed the army and pursued an aggressive foreign policy, securing the northern part of Estonia for Sweden in 1561. However, his relation to his brother John, the Duke of Finland, plummeted when the latter married a Polish princess against the King's will. John and his wife were sentenced to death (but later pardoned) and imprisoned until the paranoid King Erik suffered a period of insanity and stabbed one of his advisors to death in 1567. Fleeing into the countryside, the King was found wandering a few days later and eventually recovered. However his brothers (except Magnus, who went insane in 1562) conspired against him and managed to depose him in 1568. Erik died in prison in 1577 - probably murdered at the order of King John.;x

For some time already, Walloon craftsmen from the Hainaut, Brabant and Luxemburg regions had been fleeing unemployment and immigrated to Sweden. The influx of master metal workers and ore refiners vitalized the industry and led to a massive improvement in steel quality - a major advantage in weapons manufacture.

EVENTNAME3228;The Military Reforms of Gustavus Adolphus;x
EVENTHIST3228;In the early 17th century, Swedish King Gustavus Adolphus undertook a set of measures to reform the Swedish military system. Sweden would develop a professional army around the conscription of soldiers on the basis of same geographical origin (cities, hamlets, villages) that would bring team spirit and cohesion to units that did not exist in most mercenary armies of the time. The tactical innovations included shallower and broader formations to maximize firepower, cross training between the army branches, and light, highly mobile field artillery. The new Swedish tactical doctrine was based on firepower and mobility, eschewing heavy artillery and slow-moving tercios.;x

Although his father was a Lutheran (albeit one who sought reconciliation with the Pope), he was raised a catholic by his mother and was tutored by Jesuits. When John died in 1592, Sigismund also inherited the Swedish crown, creating for a few years the most powerful political entity in Europe. However, Sigismund's Catholicism alienated him from many important Swedish nobles who could not stomach the thought of seeing their country revert to papism. Sigismund's uncle Charles rose up in rebellion as soon as the King had left for Poland after his coronation in 1594. Sigismund returned with an army but was defeated at Stångebro in 1598, which effectively ended the brief union. For decades to come, the Polish Kings would regard Charles and his successors as usurpers - a claim that would spark several bloody wars between the nations.;x

When the Poles were eventually driven off, the Russians agreed to elect the Swedish prince Karl Filip, brother to Gustavus Vasa, but the young prince was reluctant to go, and certain political factions desired territorial concessions from the Russians instead.

Foreign entrepreneurs (mostly from the Low Countries, like Louis de Geer) started up flourishing businesses and provided excellent role models for Swedish merchants. The Swedes were even persuaded by certain Dutchmen to embark on lucrative colonial ventures, but the attempts were half-hearted as Sweden chose instead to pursue an aggressive continental policy.

The King, in two surprisingly painless parliament sessions 1680 and 1682, assumed sole control of the country with no obligation to heed either parliament or royal council.

He proved to be the most able administrator Sweden has ever had. Like Charles IX, Oxenstierna was impressed by Calvinism, and harbored notions of adopting at least elements of that faith. As Gustavus Adolphus's right hand man, he fought against the King's plans to intervene in the Thirty Years War. However, after the death of the King at Lützen in 1632, he assumed the leadership of the Protestant cause and managed to convince the French to actively participate in the conflict. He always followed domestic policies closely, but lost most of his influence following the abdication of Queen Christina, which he opposed.

The brilliant administrator kept the nation running smoothly, but the aristocratic tendencies that had been kept in check by the late King were unleashed in full by the high lords of the regency to the great detriment of the lower classes and the Crown. One of the other five regents was Karl Karlsson Gyllenhielm, bastard brother to Gustavus and high admiral of the realm. Of the lot, he was the least concerned with personal wealth and privileges.;x

Thus, when he succeeded Christina to the throne in 1654 he felt an obligation to lighten their burden as well as strengthen the state finances. As always, there were only two real ways of accomplishing this - reduction or increased contributions from the aristocracy. With great reluctance the nobles agreed to a limited reduction.

An assiduous politician, Christina was able to keep the bitter class rivalries that broke out after the war from lapsing into civil war but was unable to solve the desperate financial problems caused by the long years of fighting.

The High Nobility of Sweden defied this and managed to break any burgher-peasant coalition Christina manages to create. In a nightly discussion De la Gardie promised the Queen that she might herself chose the religion of her conscience if she stayed as Queen and ruled together with the cream of the Nobility.

EVENTHIST3241;In 1697, the 15 years old Charles XII ascended the Swedish throne. Seeing the opportunity, the Russian Czar Peter I allied with Denmark and Poland-Saxony in 1699. However, with British and Dutch naval assistance, Charles XII landed on Zealand and promptly defeated the Danes, then moved to Estland where his badly outnumbered Swedes (1 to 5) won a crushing victory over the Russians. Instead of finishing the Russians, Charles moved against August II of Poland-Saxony and drove him out of Poland in 1704 (having the pro-Swedish Stanislas Leszinski elected King), then subjugating Saxony in 1706. While the Russians started the construction of St-Petersburg (1703) and rebuilt their armies, they also took parts of Estland (1704-1706). Charles then decided to march to Moscow via the Ukraine where the Cossacks under Mazeppa had again risen in revolt (1708). The harsh winter and Russian raids decimated his army and he was finally beaten at the battle of Poltava in 1709. The wounded King escaped to the Ottomans. The Russians were encircled by the Ottomans on the Prut River, but Peter succeeded through bribery to obtain a safe conduct in exchange for Azov. While Charles was still exiled in Turkey, Russian, Danish, Hanoverian and even Prussian troops captured most of the Swedish territory around the Baltic. Having emerged from Turkish internment, Charles got killed in 1718 in front of the Norwegian fortress of Frederickshald. The peace treaties that followed Sweden lost most of her Baltic empire.;x

EVENTNAME3243;The Great Reduction;x
EVENTHIST3243;The Swedish Kings of the 16th and 17th centuries alternated between acceptance and dislike of the nobility. In Gustav Vasa's time there was little difference between a rich farmer and a nobleman, but the situation changed towards the end of his life. Erik XIV kept the nobles on a short leash whereas his brother John wanted to expand their privileges. The third brother, who was to become Charles IX, hated the nobility with an almost revolutionary fervor and surrounded himself with men of the lower classes, toying with ideas that were unheard of in his time. Under Gustavus Adolphus and Axel Oxenstierna the pendulum swung the other way and the nobles gained both land and power. This tendency took an abrupt end with Charles XI, who after the humiliating defeat of Sweden in 1679 commenced a policy of wide scale reductions of the lands and powers of the nobility and abolished the special privileges of the Baltic lords.;x

EVENTNAME3244;The Great Army Reorganisation;x
EVENTHIST3244;Charles XI was not a great warrior King like his father and his son, but he was a great reorganizer and consolidator. Apart from his centralization efforts and huge reduction of aristocratic land holdings he also remodelled the army. Most importantly, he devised the genial 'indelningsverk', or military-tenure system. The system was a military organisation where the soldiers were given a croft to live in and cultivate (made possible by the reduction), where the harvest served as their wages. Thus the country could maintain a large army in both times of peace and of war. If a peasant assumed the responsibility of maintaining an enlisted rider, his horse and equipment, he was exempted from conscription and freed from paying taxes. The peasants could cooperate in groups of 2-5 farms and maintain a soldier or a sailor. The soldiers were organized into companies of 150 men, and every county should field a regiment of 1200 men. The new system also made no distinction between officers of noble birth and commoners.;x

EVENTNAME3245;The Oriental Diplomacy;x
EVENTHIST3245;The Great Northern War required powerful allies - something Sweden had rarely been blessed with before. Charles XII thought he had found such allies in the Ottoman Empire and the Ukrainian Cossacks under Mazepa, but his hopes were eventually most cruelly dashed. Mazepa proved much less resourceful than expected and the Turks were notoriously unreliable. However, the only alternative allies were the great nations of Western Europe, and they were in no real position to strike against Russia.;x

EVENTHIST3246;The death of the childless Charles XII left his younger sister Ulrika Eleonora in charge as Queen. The staunch parliamentarian, Chancellor Arvid Horn, immediately seized this opportunity to bring down the absolutism and strengthen the powers of Parliament. While his democratic leanings were in a way commendable, his actions were to completely destabilize Sweden and make her a puppet of foreign interests for the next 50 years. This so called Age of Freedom also saw the aristocracy regain some of their lost ground. However, the young Queen saw no clear alternative that would not upset her war weary people too much.;x

EVENTNAME3248;Pietism and the Conventicle Edict;x
EVENTHIST3248;Pietism was a religious movement that started in Germany during the latter part of the 17th century. Traditionally, the Pietist movement has been viewed as a backlash against intellectualism prevalent in and among the Protestant ranks, especially in the Lutheran Church during that period. The poor Swedish soldiers, who spent long years as prisoners in Tobolsk following the battle of Poltava, had to hold their own Lutheran mass thus learning to appreciate pietism. It was with their return that the movement really took off in Sweden. However, the Swedish Lutheran Church disapproved most strongly of unauthorized preaching, which led to the Conventicle Edict of 1726, forbidding any religious gatherings outside the framework of the Church.;x

In 1726, the Polish Sejm managed to impose Maurice of Saxony, the bastard son of the current Polish King, as Duke, but only to change her mind and ask his withdrawal. At the same time, Russia was pushing for her own candidate, the Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, son-in-law of the Czarina Catherine I. After much bribing, negotiation and behind the scene diplomacy, Maurice was summoned to either leave or suffer war. It started in 1727, with Russia firmly committed and sending 8,000 troops to conquer the Duchy within 8 days. The war did not last long enough to embrace all of Europe and Maurice fled to France where he then had a brilliant military career.;x

Naturally, the two opposing parties of the Riksdag were embroiled in a bitter fight over the choice of a crown prince. The Caps argued for the Danish prince Frederik, but the Hats had found another candidate in Adolf Frederik of Holstein-Gottorp. In 1743 Adolf Frederik was elected heir to the throne of Sweden by the Hats, who favored a foreign policy that would regain Swedish hegemony in the Baltic. The Hats hoped by their choice to obtain better conditions of peace from the Russian empress Elizabeth, who was favorable to the house of Gottorp.;x

The foreign meddling increased steadily, and when Gustavus III seized power in 1772 the most powerful political figure in Sweden was the Russian ambassador. At the Riksdag of 1738 the Hats managed to outmaneuver the peaceful Arvid Horn and seize power.

In 1756, the Council informed the King that they were going to start using a royal seal on documents he refused to sign. Furious at this blatant insult, the Queen began planning a Coup d'Etat in June, but her co-conspirators were exposed and executed. As a result, royal power was reduced yet another notch.;x

EVENTNAME3259;The Anjala League;x
EVENTHIST3259;Gustavus III, the 'theatre King', declared war on Russia in the summer of 1788. His main goals were to reclaim the honor of the Swedish military, retake some land that had been lost to Russia in previous wars and perhaps most importantly - put a stop to the incessant Russian meddling in Swedish politics. At the time, Sweden had a magnificent fleet and a rather effective army, but most of the officers could be described as politicians rather than soldiers. The Swedish army began marching on St. Petersburg and won some minor battles despite the compact resistance from the officers. On August 12 a group of 112 Finnish noble officers formed the 'Anjala League' and opened up negotiations with the Russians, declaring the war to be illegal and probing for the possibility of an independent Finnish state. This event effectively ended all hopes of a Swedish victory since the King was in a poor position to execute the traitors and have them replaced.;x

Gustav and his heirs were deprived of their royal titles and encouraged to leave the country. The deposed King eventually settled in Switzerland under the name of Colonel Gustafsson. While the search went on for a new crown prince Sweden was ruled by Gustav III's aged and childless uncle Charles (XIII). The Danish prince Christian August was elected as adopted son and successor, but died suddenly in 1810.

So this brief document purported to do no more than enforce the terms of the Peace of Augsburg. However, the interpretation put on that document was that which had been urged by partisans of Catholicism. Thus it became the source of outrage for King Gustav II Adolphus of Sweden (the Lion of the North) who, like Christian IV before him, came to aid the German Lutherans to forestall Catholic aggression against their homeland and to obtain economic influence in the German states around the Baltic Sea which were being threatened by the growing influence of the imperial authority.;x

In addition to this the struggle between Sten Sture den yngre (the younger) and Trolle was a matter of land and riches, in 1517 the swedish Riksdag therefore decided to remove the bishop from his position and raze his castle, even though this was something that only the Pope was allowed to do.

The initiative in this matter came from the Primate of the Catholic Church of Sweden, Archbishop Jakob Ulvsson of Uppsala. After the Pope's approval the new University was established. It was small, having at most 50 students and a handful of professors. Uppsala University fell into decay in the first decade of the 16th century due to the political unrest of the period.;x

EVENTNAME291017;Restoring privileges of the Uppsala University;x
EVENTHIST291017;At the end of the 16th century the Protestant clergy had gained a firm hold over religious teaching and a decision was made at a meeting in Uppsala in 1593 to restore the privileges of the University. The new charter was signed on 15 March 1595. During the reign of Gustav II Adolf Sweden became a bureaucratic state, so the Kingdom needed competent government officials. The King provided benefits to the University, both economically and administratively. Professors from other countries were summoned and the number of students increased.;x

EVENTNAME291019;Unrest in Sweden;x
EVENTHIST291019;Following the wars against the counts of Holstein the unrest in Sweden was very high due to the war taxes imposed by Erik. In 1434 this resulted in major rebellion in northern and central Sweden. Erik had no choice but to sign a treaty that severely reduced his power in Sweden or face a full-scale Swedish war. He ended up signing the treaty and was now obliged to heed the advice of the Swedish State Council as well as only allow Swedish nobles to govern Swedish provinces. Erik was furious and left for his castle in Gotland leaving the administration of Denmark in the hands of the Danish State Council.;x
#;x
EVENTNAME291020;Rebellion in Sweden;x
EVENTHIST291020;The Swedes were not happy with the Danes' frequent wars on Schleswig, Holstein, Mecklenburg, and Pomerania, which were a disturbance to Swedish iron exports to the European continent. Furthermore, the centralization of government in Denmark raised suspicions. The Swedish Privy Council wanted to retain a fair degree of self-government. The unity of the union eroded in the 1430s, even to the point of armed rebellion, leading to the expulsion of Danish forces from Sweden.;x

EVENTNAME291021;Sweden claims Gotland and Norway;x
EVENTHIST291021;When Erik retreated to Gotland and began pirating on merchants in the Baltic Sea he lost support from Denmark. An opportunity to seize the claim on Gotland for the Swedish nobles presented itself at the death of Christopher of Bavaria in 1448, without a direct heir, Charles VIII was elected king of Sweden on June 20 and on June 28 he was hailed as the new monarch at the Stone of Mora, not far from Uppsala. Charles now claimed Norway and Gotland as Swedish crown lands. His election as king of Sweden resulted in an effort to reestablish the Kalmar Union, this time under Swedish initiative, and in 1449 he was also elected king of Norway. The Danish had in September 1448 elected Christian I as their new monarch. Soon, in 1450, Charles was forced to cede Norway to Christian. From 1451, Sweden and Denmark were in state of war against each other which would last for three years.;x

EVENTNAME291028;The decline of Swedish influence in Germany;x
EVENTHIST291028;Sweden's military campaign conducted against an Anti-Swedish coalition, originally formed by Russia, Denmark, Saxony and Poland (and successively enlarged with Hanover and Prussia) in the so-called Great Northern Conflict, saw most of her possessions around the estuaries of Elbe and Weser Rivers, severely threatened by invasions of enemy armies. The possession of these territories enabled the owner to gain control over the most important trade routes of the Holy Roman Empire, claimed by Sweden in the stipulation of the treaty of Wesphalia, which ended the Thirty Years War. Signing the treaty of Stockholm in 1720 Sweden renounced her Northern German possessions in the bishoprics of Bremen and Verden.;x

EVENTHIST291031;Sweden had been highly successful in the Thirty Years' War, having defeated Danish armies in Germany and seen substantial victories under Gustavus Adolphus and, after this death, under the leadership of Count Axel Oxenstierna, Lord High Chancellor of Sweden. At the same time, Sweden was continually threatened by Denmark-Norway, which almost completely encircled Sweden from the south (Blekinge, Skåne, and Halland), the west (Bohuslän) and the northwest (Jämtland). The Danish Sound Dues were also a continuing source of irritation and a contributing factor to the war. \n \nIn the spring of 1643 the Swedish Privy Council determined that their military strength made territorial gains at the expense of Denmark likely. The Count drew up the plan for war and directed a surprise multiple-front attack on Denmark in May.;x

EVENTNAME291038;Migration from Karelia;x
EVENTHIST291038;Since the 13th century the Karelians have lived in the tension between the East and the West, between Eastern Orthodoxy and Western Catholicism. During this century, the Swedish crown established Korsholm as the administrative centre of Österbotten and Swedish became the main culture of the region. During the early 15th century large parts of the inland Österbotten were colonized by Finnish settlers who arrived from Karelia due to the religious persecution by the Russians and the Orthodox church.;x

EVENTNAME291039;Swedish migration in Österbotten;x
EVENTHIST291039;Korsholm has a history that can be dated back to 1348. Thanks to the sea connections with Stockholm, ship building and trade became the main export, Österbotten flourished and attracted Swedish migration. On October 2, 1606 during  the reign of Charles IX of Sweden the town was grated city status and renamed to Vaasa, the new capital of the area was near the old harbour and trade point close to the Korsholm church. In 1611 the city was chartered and renamed after the Royal House of Vasa. The municipality since the Karelian migration was bilingual, with a majority from 17th century,  being Swedish and a minority being Finnish speakers. Religiously by 1606, both Swedes and Finns in Österbotten had the same religion.;x

We now consider people in the province Kexholm as accepted subjects of our empire.;x
#;x
EVENTNAME291043;Swedish Conquest of Kexholm;x
EVENTHIST291043;Sweden received the county of Kexholm through the treaty of Stolbovo in 1617. Most of the population in Kexholm was Orthodox Karelian alongside an Ortodox Russian minority. Under the terms of the treaty people were free to practice their religion, but under the first governor of the new province, Jacob de la Gardie, Orthodox monks and boyars were ordered to leave and religious repression began. This caused a massive exodus of Karelians and Russians from the province over the decades despite an official ban on relocation. At the same time Swedish and especially Finnish immigrants were invited to settle and occupy the province permanently.;x

EVENTHIST5008;Miguel Servet (or Servetus) was an aragonese physician who was trained in Lyon and Paris and whose theological ideas became very polemic. He believed that God is unitary and that the Trinity is not founded in scripture. He anonymously published 'Restitution of Christianity', a book outlining his theological views, but was persecuted when his authorship was discovered. His old friend John Calvin was especially angered by these ideas. Servet also proposed that the blood traveled from the heart through the pulmonary artery and back through the pulmonary vein, without actually passing through the septum. After being persecuted by the french church, Servet fled for Italy, traveling through Geneva, where Jean Calvin had the power and Servet hoped to find some support from him. But Calvin was very angered by the philosophical and theological ideas of Servet, so Calvin had Servet arrested, and condemned him to burning at the stake, which took place 27th october 1553.;x

EVENTNAME20306;The Swiss Guard in Rome;x
EVENTHIST20306;When, at the end of the 15th century, with Charles VIII the Italian Wars began, the Swiss were described by the Italian historian Guicciardini, as 'the nerve and the hope of an army'. In 1495 the life of the King of France was saved thanks to the immovable firmness of his Swiss foot-soldiers. At the beginning of the 16th century the Vatican began to employ Swiss mercenaries, who had a reputation of courage, noble sentiments and loyalty. Because of their faithful and disinterested service Pope Julius II in 1505 asked the Swiss Federal Tagesatzung to provide him with a constant core of 200 Swiss mercenaries for the protection of the Apostolic palace in Rome. In September 1505, a first contingent of 150 soldiers started their march towards Rome, they entered for the first time the Vatican in the evening of the 22nd of January 1506, where they were blessed by Pope Julius II. The prelate Johann Burchard of Strasbourg, Master of Pontifical Ceremonies at that time, and author of a famous chronicle, noted that event in his diary. Their first, and most significant, hostile engagement was on May 6, 1527 when 147 Guards, including their commander, died fighting the lansquenets lead by Charles de Bourbon, Constable of France, in the Sack of Rome.;x

EVENTHIST20307;Between 1513 and 1536, Switzerland took the shape she still has today. Five new cantons (Fribourg, Solothurn, Basel and Schaffhausen and Appenzell) had joined the Confederation already in the past three decades, and the takeover of Vaud and Valais from Savoy brought even more land and more wealth to the country. This also brought some stability to the balance of denominations, preventing the collapse of the Confederation for religious reasons.;x

EVENTNAME20308;Jean Calvin settles in Geneva;x
EVENTHIST20308;Jean Chauvin or Calvin was a Picard bourgeois favoured by the bishop of Noyon. His father worked in the city government before losing the favour of the local Church. After spending some years in Paris, Calvin became interested in Lutheran teachings, and subsequently converted to Protestantism. The Affair of the Placards, which involved a direct attack to the King of France, forced him to escape from Paris as no Protestant was safe there after that event occurred. He went to Geneva, but the population expelled him. He returned in 1541 and settled there until his death, working in the Consistory. Calvin, unlike Luther, was a one-book-man. His three editions of the monumental Institutio Christianae Religionis are a masterpiece of theological Protestantism, and one of the most important books of the century, highly influential for Dutch, Scottish and English reformed Protestants. Calvin also planned a severe reform of customs and ancient practices, and in his war with local nobility, he prosecuted and expelled many of his opponents. Geneva was to be a model city, a city ''fearful of God'', tidy, clean, and with no vagabonds or idle people. Consequences for both Geneva and Switzerland were extremely important, because a ferocious moral regime was started to supervise any practices that looked dangerous to both Church and Government. Also, many foreigners were attracted by the opportunity to freely practice Protestant Eucharist and Baptism (the basis of Lutheran and reformed rituals), therefore adding more than 5,000 inhabitants to city as Geneva, Bern and Zurich.;x

Finally, in 1685, he declared that the majority of Protestants had been converted to Catholicism and that the Edict of Nantes of 1598, having thus become superfluous, was revoked. Thousands of French Protestants fled abroad to escape the violent persecutions which followed immediately. Switzerland, like England, the Netherlands and other Protestant states, appealed to many highly skilled and industrious people, who strenghtened her economy.;x

EVENTHIST20311;Following its mission to 'liberate' all the European populations from the grasp of the Ancien Régime, the French post-revolutionary governments abolished the Confederation and established the Helvetic Republic, with a single constitution, giving little consideration for the history and traditions of the Swiss country. Internal disorder would arise and steadily worsen. The pro-French puppet state would be unable to cope with the new 'innovative' situation.

EVENTNAME184031;Witch-hunting in Switzerland;x
EVENTHIST184031;The medieval Inquisition tried a large number of witches, but collective witch-hunting was exclusively a modern phenomena. Individual maleficium (Latin for witchcraft) was not uncommon in many rural areas, but it wasn't until scholastic demonology related witches and Sabbaths (night meetings with strong conspiracy elements, including cannibalism, orgies and a sacred oath of loyalty to Satan himself) that societies started to get obsessed with the matter. This conspiracy paranoia can track its roots as far as to the first massacres of Jews and Lepers in the High Middle Ages, when thousands were slaughtered by defeated Crusaders and angry countrymen. But it's in the early 15th century when demonological theories will become fully accepted by the upper classes. The Councils of Constance and Basel are considered to be the first public space in which these concepts, maleficium and Sabbath were publicly related. The work of Johannes Nider (1380-1438), The Formicarius (The Anthill), was a masterpiece of scholastic demonology and marked a new era in witch-hunting. The work of Heinrich Kramer (1430-1505), Malleus Maleficarum (Hammer of the Wicked) was the first work that reaches widespread attention, and works as a inquisitorial manual for witch-hunters. But it's not the Church that tries the most in Modern Ages. On the contrary, civil courts are responsible for 85-90 percent of executions. \n \nSwitzerland is home to the first witch-hunting process and an estimate of 5,000-10,000 burned witches makes it one of the most affected regions in Europe. Only by the early 18th century, with Illustration at the doors of Geneva, will the horrible massacre stop producing victims on the western side of the Alps.;x

EVENTNAME20123;The Teutonic Order and Danzig;x
EVENTHIST20123;The Medieval province of Danzig belonged to Poland on similar terms as the Marches belonged to HRE. In 1309, the Teutonic Order, feigning that it wanted to help against Brandenburgians who sieged the city, grabbed the land. Poland never recognized this fact. Both countries found themselves in continuous warfare which culminated in the Battle of Grunwald. The defeated Teutonic Order never regained its position. The population of Danzig was about 90 percent Polish. About 5 percent were Dutch who started to migrate to the delta of Vistula in the 16th century. The cities of Danzig, Thorn, and others were mainly settled by Germans who were definitely more interested in trade than in politics. The Teutonic Order had problems with Danzig, since the political aims of the Order were in contradiction to the policy of the city and province. Had the Teutonic Order encouraged more rustic people from Germany to settle in Danzig, then it may have been easier to rule.;x

In the desperate financial, political and military situation caused by the uprising of the Prussian Lizard League and the intervention of Casimir of Poland in favour of the rebels, the Order decided it would be better to sell Neumark back to the Elector of Brandenburg in order to gain some money and his support than to loose the territory to the Polish King who was obviously attracted by the opportunity to restore the Oder as border with Germany. Thus on February 22nd emissaries of the Order offered the territory to Friedrich II for 40000 Gulden.

Her marriage with Stefan III cel Mare of Moldavia (r.1457-1504) in 1472 proved bittersweet. On one hand Theodoros gained an ally against the Ottomans but the Prince's new relation later engineered Issakios's downfall in favour of his new brother-in-law Alexandros (1475).

The Tuaregs accepted this deal, installing Muhammad Naddiwa as their governor. When Muhammad's son Omar took over as governor, the Tuaregs seized the opportunity to change the deal. Just before the tribute was due, Akil sent raiders to take it all, even the taxes meant for the city. Then he arrived in Timbuktu and demanded the city pay him his tribute (again).

Alcaudete attacked in 1547, but was driven back by the Turks. Meanwhile, in Morocco, the pro-Turkish Wattasid sultan Ahmad, was defeated by the Sa'did Muhammad al-Shaykh (al-Mahdi), who then invaded Tlemcen putting and end to 300 years of Zayyanid rule there.

EVENTHIST332006;The Zayyanid or Abdalwadid Berber dynasty in Tlemcen had managed to inherit the central part of the Maghreb from the Almohads. They were neither rich nor powerful, but managed to prosper with the trade routes from the interior to the coast, where Aragon took the slaves and gold to the Italian ports. However they were constantly attacked by the Banu Marinids of Morocco. When the Marinids were substituted by the weaker Wattasids, Tlemcen was no longer at risk of being annexed by Morocco, but they were left in a state of extreme weakness, and ridden with problems with the nomadic Arab tribes inside the Kingdom, that were never under control. Taking advantage of their weakness, the Hafsids of Tunis took their turn at beating them. In 1424, Abu Faris Abd al-Aziz invaded Tlemcen, and after dethroning Abu Malik Abd al-Wahid, substituted him with Abu Abd Allah Muhammad, as his vassal.;x

Its port, Mers-el-Kebir, is one of the best in the Barbary Coast. The commerce with Spain was always important, given its closeness, but Genoa, Marseille and Venice also established commercial outposts or funduqs there. Wahran remained independent from the end of the Merinid period in Tlemcen to 1437, when it finally fell to repeated attacks by the Banu Zayyan rulers of Tlemcen.;x

Ignoring Hetman István Zólkiewski's counteroffer of a Polish alliance against the Turks, Bethlen joined forces with the Czech and Moravian army of Count Thurn and besieged Vienna only to be ousted by Imperial forces. Preliminary negotiations failed as Bethlen insisted on including the Bohemians, but was elected King of Hungary. Yet Austrian arms won the Battle of White Mountain (8 November 1620) forcing Bethlen to conclude the Peace of Nikolsburg (31 December 1620). Ferdinand kept St.Stephen's crown upon confirming the Peace of Vienna (1606). Bethlen became an 'Imperial Prince' with counties in the Upper Theiss and fortresses in Tokaj, Munkacs and Ecsed.

EVENTHIST282008;Despite his gains in the Peace of Nikolsburg (1620) Gábor rejoined the war against Vienna as an ally of the Protestants (1623-26). Yet the Treaties of Vienna and Pressburg awarded Bethlen no more than a renewal of the concessions from Nikolsburg. Hence he tried reconciling with Austria to secure an alliance against the Porte and a Habsburg bride. Ferdinand II refused on both accounts. Accordingly Bethlen became firmly entrenched in the Protestant camp - marrying the sister-in-law of Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, Catherine Hohenzollern of Brandenburg.;x

EVENTHIST282009;Bethlen was likened to his great predecessor - Mátyás Corvin (1458-1490). Like Corvin he embarked on reforms aimed at improving the state. Ruling as an 'Enlightened Autocrat' he developed mines and industry whilst nationalising foreign trade. A patron of the Arts and Learning, Gábor took peculiar interest in education - founding schools for the children of serfs. In addition he sent students to Protestant universities in England, the Low Countries and the Holy Roman Empire. Calvinism flourished. Despite the huge cost of his projects, Bethlen built a new palace at Gyulafehérvár - keeping an opulent court and a standing army of mercenaries to conduct his ambitious foreign policy.;x

By the final years of the Thirty Years War (1618-48), Rákóczi at the urging of Swedes, French and Ottomans declared war against Ferdinand III (2 February 1644). The hard-pressed Austrians soon lost Royal Hungary to Transylvanian forces and Vienna was compelled to conclude the Peace of Linz (16 September 1645) - according full religious liberty to the Magyars and the fortress of Regec and the Tokaj district to Rákóczi.;x

Yet he achieved little til joining forces with a warlike Karl X Gustav of Sweden in an act of defiance against his suzerain the Sultan. Occupying Karkow and Warsaw in 1657, Polish resolve and the sudden Swedish withdraw left Rákóczi without allies. An angry Sultan had even dispatched the Crimean Tartars after him forcing the Prince to accept the most humiliating of terms with Jan II Kazimieras of Poland before returning home to be deposed by the Porte.;x

His Kurucok forces soon occupied Upper Hungary and named him Prince of Transylvania (8 June 1704). But an Imperial victory at Blenheim (13 August 1704) against Rákóczi's French allies began a reversal of fortune. Having failed to reach an agreement with Leopold I of Austria, Rákóczi deposed Leopold from the Hungarian throne in hopes of securing further French support. Instead both sides fought to the bitter end. Without allies the Kurucok suffered loss after loss, effectively ending the uprising in the Treaty of Szatmár (11 May 1711). Henceforth the Magyars and Transylvania became a part of the Austrian Empire.;x

EVENTNAME5222;Brunelleschi and the Duomo of Florence;x
EVENTHIST5222;The work for the cathedral in Florence had begun in 1296 and proceeded very slowly. When the architect and sculptor Filippo Brunelleschi became interested in the project the main problem facing the architects was the construction of the dome. Huge engineering problems faced the placing of a dome on the octagonal Baptistry, and much argument had taken place on how to solve this and Brunelleschi set to work on finding an innovative solution. He combined his artistic skills, his mathematical skills and his understanding of mechanical devices when he made a proposal to the wardens of works of the cathedral when they set up a competition in 1418 to find the best solution to the problem of designing and constructing the dome. Brunelleschi proposed a double selfsupporting shell and a rib structure to support the enormous weight. He proposed brick as a building material, laid in rotating herringbone patterns. In 1420 Brunelleschi was awarded the commission and construction began.;x

By the time Brunelleschi died, in 1446, the dome was almost completely finished. It soon became one of the masterworks of architecture, admired throughout the world. Although the duomo of Santa Maria del Fiore was the most famous of Brunelleschi's architectural achievements, there are many other examples of his stunning architecture in Florence.;x

EVENTNAME5226;Galileo Galilei: the modern science is born;x
EVENTHIST5226;Galileo was born in Pisa in Tuscany and he is chiefly remembered for his work on free fall, his use of the telescope and his employment of experimentation. Early in his career he determined that repetition time of a pendulum was the same regardless of the amplitude of the oscillation. He determined, experimentally, that objects do not fall with velocities proportionate to their weight, that was a direct contradiction of the teachings of Aristotle. In 1609 he built a telescope and began detailed observations of the sky. However his disagreements with the Aristotelean canon made his life at the University of Padua increasingly difficult as he met accusations from the Church and the opposition of detractors at the University. In 1610 Cosimo II invited him to come to Florence and continue his work away from his opponents.;x

EVENTHIST5227;In Florence Galileo continued his work on motion and on mechanics, and began to get involved in disputes about Copernicanism. Galileo showed a marked tendency to use all his discoveries as evidence for Copernicanism, and to do so with great verbal as well as mathematical skill. Copernicanism was in contradiction with Scripture, and in 1616 Galileo was given some kind of secret, but official, warning that he was not to defend Copernicanism. Just what was said on this occasion was to become a subject for dispute when Galileo was accused of departing from this undertaking in his 'Dialogue concerning the two greatest world systems', published in Florence in 1632.;x

He oversaw burnings of luxuries, scourging of the wicked and violent denuciations of the excesses of the merchant classes. In 1497, during the carnival, rather than the traditional games and costume parades Savonarola oversaw the famous 'bonfire of the vanities', where numerous paintings, books and clothes that were considered lewd were burned, destroying many of Florence's artistic assets.;x

This decision was received with horror by the Sienese who begged with Charles V not to proceed. He refused, and several Sienese citizens in Rome received aid from French agents and collected an army. In 1552, as they marched on Siena the people revolted and threw out the Spanish troops, and an independent Siena took up a pro-French policy. Henri II, King of France, tried to exploit the situation by sending there an army led by Paul de Termes, who was successively substituted by Strozzi when an invasion of Corsica was attempted with the help of the Turkish fleet. On Emperor Charles V's decision to inflict an exemplary punishment upon the rebeling city, Cosimo I Duke of Tuscany responded to his call by invading and pillaging the villages surrounding Siena with the help of Spanish/imperial troops. After a year long siege laid by Medeghino and his Florentine troops, the city of Siena was eventually taken.;x

Cosimo de' Medici was becoming increasingly influential in the republic's politics - he was supported by the 'popolo minuto', the ordinary workers who had no say in the government, and by the lesser guilds. Rumours circulated that Cosimo was plotting to use mercenary troops to set himself up as ruler of Florence. When Rodolfo degli Albizzi managed to gain control of the 'signoria' (the governing council) he used his influence to have Cosimo imprisoned. Rather than executing the Medici, under pressure from the Medici's debtors and supporters he had the family exiled for ten years and declared them nobles, thereby excluding them from any role in the government of the city forever. Reluctant to act by force and willing to bide his time, Cosimo complied. Should we exile the Medici or overthrow Albizzi's government?;x

The oligarchic party lost influence and Rinaldo Albizzi lost popularity until the 'signoria' summoned him to judgement. Rather than be exiled Rinaldo summoned his guards and attacked city hall. He was beaten off, and then exiled. Cosimo de' Medici was recalled and was now in complete control of the city, although he maintained republican forms. He introduced the 'decima scalata', a progressive income tax to reduce the tax burden of the poor. He patronized Petrarch and Bocaccio, and founded the Platonic Academy in 1440.;x

Lorenzo de' Medici was asked to mediate and rules in favor of the consortium, who immediately seized the mine, causing violent rioting in Volterra and the murder of some of the members of the consortium. Many influential Florentines argued that the Volterrans should be offered lenient terms to defuse the crisis, but Lorenzo felt that they should be taught a lesson. He hired mercenaries, and after a siege of a month the town was plundered in violation of the terms of surrender. This event is still memorialized in Volterre.

Giuliano was killed by a mercenary, but the two priests assigned to kill Lorenzo only wounded him in the neck. The conspirators were all killed, along with most of their supporters and suspected supporters. The Pope was enraged by the scale of the vengeance wreaked by the Medici's supporters.

Based out of Pisa their role was to serve the Grand Duke when he needed naval support and to defend Tuscan interests in the Mediterranean. They played a role in many of the great conflicts in the Mediterranean against the Ottomans, including the battle of Lepanto (1572) and the siege of Candia (1645-1669). When not at war they engaged in piracy against Turkish, and occasionally Venetian shipping. This was the first naval force Tuscany had ever had, and represented a change in the military stance of the Tuscan state.;x

EVENTHIST17377;Piero Soderini had been elected Gonfalonier (chief magistrate) of Florence for life, and Machiavelli was immediately able to win his favor and become indispensable to the new Florentine ruler. The remarkable influence he had over the head of state enabled Machiavelli to realize his military ideas. For centuries the states of Italy had used mercenary troops in their wars, and Machiavelli had seen in practice their lack of discipline, their faithlessness, and their dangerous arrogance. Inspired both by the military enterprises of ancient Rome and by his own observations in France (where he went on a second mission early in 1504) and in the Romagna (where Cesare Borgia had replaced mercenaries with troops levied from his own territory), Machiavelli ardently pursued the idea of giving the Florentine state a militia of its own, recruited from the citizens under its control.

In the aftermath of the Council of Florence he was able to get support from Spain, and accompanied an army that invaded Tuscany. The Tuscan militia could not stop the advance of this army, and as it neared Florence Giovanni opened negotiations with the city. Piero Soderini offered to step down to allow the Medici to return, but the city refused to accept Medici rule. Because the city refused to submit, the cardinal's army captured and pillaged the nearby town of Prato after which Florence submitted. What should we do about Soderini's offer?;x

EVENTNAME297000;The Staging of Mandragola;x
EVENTHIST297000;In 1525, Machiavelli staged his comic play, Mandragola -- considered by many to be the beginning of modern Italian drama. It is an incredible testament to the man who wrote The Prince that he could also be the author of the lines : He who makes no test, Oh Love, of your great power, must hope in vain ever to have true faith in Heaven's highest worth. The friar cares not for the health of souls, but only for the fattening of his pockets. And Machiavelli asserts the superiority of classical values to medieval ones judging his times degenerate and having the protagonist say : 'And in Hell how many worthy men there are!'. Still, in Mandragola you find evidence of a new European idea of drama as Machiavelli includes wry criticisms of contemporary dramatic theory inside the body of the play. As the eminent scholar of Machiavelli, Allen Gilbert, wrote, 'Not to know Mandragola is not to know The Prince'.;x

EVENTNAME297001;The Military of the Medici Restoration;x
EVENTHIST297001;The republican government had resurrected Machiavelli's 'Nine of Militia' in 1527 and added some innovations of their own - most notably conscription for city citizens themselves. The reconstructed militia proved itself to be formidable in the contest with Charles V and could well be a useful tool for the future grandeur of Florence. However, keeping citizens in arms contains risks for those who mean to rule, and rule absolutely. The new Duke, Alessandro de' Medici faced a decisionabout how to establish his military.;x

EVENTNAME297002;Machiavelli deposed;x
EVENTHIST297002;In September 1512, Piero Soderini's government fell and by November, Machiavelli had lost his position as secretary of Florence. Soon after he was barred from leaving Florence, barred access to the Palazzo, and a bond of 1,000 gold florins. Four months after his dismissal, a plot is discovered to assassinate either cardinal Giovanni Medici or Giuliano Medici and Machiavelli's name is on a list of possible supporters. A warrant for his arrest is posted and after Machiavelli presents himself to the authorities, he is thrown in the prison palazzo Bargello. In jail, Machiavelli is held in shackles and regularly subjected to the torture known as 'the rope' or strappado. He spent his time there writing poetry about his circumstances, noting that he could hear the priests praying for the souls of the soon-to-be-executed beneath his cell window. On 11 March 1513, Cardinal Giovanni Medici is elected Pope and becomes Leo X. He announces a general amnesy upon his ascension and Machiavelli is released from prison.;x

EVENTNAME297003;The Statue of Snow;x
EVENTHIST297003;On January 20, 1494, there was a great snowstorm in Florence which let loose more snow than seen in living memory - heaps of it were piled in the corners of the alleyways. Piero de' Medici was staring out the window of the palace when he saw Michelangelo Buanoarroti walk past and yet another ill-starred idea occurred to him: 'Why not celebrate this extraordinary event by commissioning from the greatest living artist a statue of snow?'. Michelangelo, who held music in contempt for its ephemerality, was not pleased, but he dared not refuse the son of his old patron, so he sculpted a statue of snow. Piero rejoiced at the beauty of it, but we can only guess how the great artist felt when it had melted the very next day. Safe to say, Piero had alienated yet another of his father's old allies.;x

EVENTNAME297004;Giovanni Pico della Mirandola;x
EVENTHIST331049;Born in the Castle of Mirandola (in the Duchy of Modena) at the age of fourteen went to Bologna to study Canon Law, but, repelled by the purely positivist science of Law, he traveled to chief universities of Italy and France where he studied Hebrew, Syriac, Arabic, Latin and Greek as well as the philosophy of Averroes. In December 1486, Pico published in Rome his 900 these and invited all scholars to a public disputation in January, 1487. However, Pope Innocent VIII suspended the disputation and appointed a commission to examine the theses. Pico published an Apologia to defend his theses, but this only made things worse and started a conflict with the Papal authorities that lasted for the rest of his life. Pico then fled to Florence, where he became an important part of the Academy there, even though he stood in opposition to the standard Platonism fashionable there. His most important work - which is still studied by philosophers today - was the Oration on the Dignity of Man, which was probably originally composed in preparation for the disputation. It held that man was separate from the rest of nature not because we were the center of the universe, but because we are free to become either animals or angels, or, that is, anything in it: ''I have set thee,' says the Creator to Adam, 'in the midst of the world, that thou mayst the more easily behold and see all that is therein. I created thee a being neither heavenly nor earthly, neither mortal nor immortal only, that thou mightest be free to shape and to oversome thyself. Thou mayst sink into a beast, and be born anew to the divine likeness. To thee alone is given a growth and a development depending on thine own free will. Thou bearest in thee the germs of a universal life.'' In his later life he dedicated his work to defending Christianity against the Jews and Mohammedans and became a follower of Savonarola. His interest in Kabbalah led to a broad current of Christian Kabbalahism which included John Reuchlin and remained important throughout the 16th century. On Pico's deathbed, Savonarola had a vision where the Virgin came to assure him that Pico would not die. Savonarola explained this vision later by saying that the Virgin meant the 'second' life, not the first. In his funeral oration for his friend, Savonarola criticized Pico for not entering a monastic order, but reassured his audience that Pico would be found safely in Purgatory, due to the preacher's alms and prayers. Pico della Mirandola died on 17 November 1494, the day King Charles VIII entered Italy. The Oration was published posthumously.;x

It is a very popular act as one chronicler puts it, now the common folk have the satisfaction of seeing 'those who previously paid 20 florins are now paying 300'. The excitement was appeased by Giovanni de' Medici, who said, It is not well to go into things so long past, unless to learn something for our present guidance, and if in former times the taxation has been unjust, we ought to be thankful, that we have now discovered a method of making it equitable, and hope that this will be the means of uniting the citizens, not of dividing them, which would certainly be the case were they to attempt the recovery of taxes for the past, and make them equal to the present, and that he who is content with a moderate victory is always most successful, for those who would more than conquer, commonly lose.;x

EVENTNAME297016;Beccaria's essay on Crimes and Punishments;x
EVENTHIST297016;In 1764, Cesare Bonesana, Marquis of Beccaria, published a brief but justly celebrated treatise, 'Dei Delitti e delle Pene' (On Crimes and Punishments), which marked the high point of the Milan Enlightenment. In it, Beccaria put forth the first arguments ever made against the death penalty. His treatise was also the first full work of penology, advocating reform of the criminal law system. Apart from condemning the death penalty (on two grounds: first, because the state does not possess the right to take lives and secondly, because capital punishment is neither a useful nor a necessary form of punishment), Beccaria developed in his treatise a number of innovative and influential principles: punishment had a preventive, not a retributive, function, punishment should be proportionate to the crime committed, the certainty of punishment, not its severity, would achieve the preventive effect, procedures of criminal convictions should be public and finally, in order to be effective, punishment should be prompt. The book was the first full-scale work to tackle criminal reform and to suggest that criminal justice should conform to rational principles. In this, Beccaria reflected the convictions of the 'Il Caffè' group, who sought to cause reform through Enlightenment discourse. Put across in a clear and animated style, the book's serious message was based in particular upon a deep sense of humanity and of urgency at unjust suffering. This humane sentiment was what made Beccaria appeal for rationality in the laws. In 1786 Pietro Leopoldo of Habsburg-Lorraine was the first European monarch to reform the penal code with his 'Codice Leopoldino', he but followed Beccaria's argument about the lack of utility of capital punishment, not about the state's lacking right to execute citizens.;x

EVENTNAME297018;Florentine fear;x
EVENTHIST297018;On the approach of the French in 1494, Piero de' Medici, son and successor of Lorenzo, had suffered a loss of nerve and had left the city to negotiate with Charles VIII. He extracted a promise from the French King to respect the freedom of the city, but only in return for handing over some of the most important fortresses protecting Florentine territory. When the news of this arrangement reached the city, it aroused a great wave of anger and resentment. Piero, forgetting the lessons of his ancestors, had already made himself unpopular by his arrogance and his flaunting of his position. The consequence was an uprising that drove out Piero and his rule and restored a more popular government. The new government admitted the French to the city, and some tense negotiations took place, in which the Florentines feared that Charles would try to restore Piero and become their master. The determination of the citizens to resist these demands, by arms if need be, so impressed Charles that he did not press them, but departed leaving the city its freedom. He held on to the fortresses, including Pisa, which had thrown off Florentine rule at the approach of the French. To regain Pisa was a passion with Florence, and the hope of doing so with French help was one reason why Florence made an alliance with France and stuck to it faithfully during the next few years.;x

Florence hadn't still arranged any defense and the Medici's party easily took power deposed Soderini and let the Medici family enter the city.

EVENTNAME297022;The greatest Artist's competition ever;x
EVENTHIST297022;It happened a day that Gonfaloniere Piero Soderini, in order to exalt the values of the Republic, hired two of the best artists living in those times to decorate a wall in the 'Salone dei Cinquecento' in 'Palazzo Vecchio' with two frescos representing two of the most important military successes for the city's history. These two artists were Michelangelo Buonarroti, who chose to represent the 'Battle of Cascina' fought in 1364 between Florence and Pisa, and Leonardo da Vinci, who chose to represent the 'Battle of Anghiari', fought in 1440 between Florence and the Duke of Milan. Instead of a mixture of men and horses fiercely struggling around a flag sketched by Leonardo, Michelangelo focused more on exalting the human action through the representation of several bare figures in movement. It was during his stay in Florence that Leonardo painted his most famous portrait 'la Monna Lisa', also known as 'la Gioconda', named after Francesco Bartolomeo del Giocondo, the husband of the assumedly portraited woman. During his life Leonardo would never separate himself from this 'enigmatic smile'. In the meanwhile Michelangelo was sculpting one of his most famous marble statues 'il David'. Although both the cartoons were ready, unfortunately the frescos commissioned by the Florentine Republic were never realized: Leonardo was invited to come back in Milan by the French King Louis XII, while Michelangelo went to Rome on Pope Julius II's request.;x

But Invading Romagna, the duke of Milan would break the 1420 peace treaty stipulated with the Florentine Republic as to guarantee 10 years of non-belligerence.

Therefore when Archduke Ernst the Iron of Styria prematurely died in his best manhood in 1424 at the age of 47, and his sons Friedrich and Albrecht were only 9 and 5 years old, their uncle Friedrich IV, Count of Tyrol, became tutor of the two brothers and administered Styria, Carinthia and Carniola not only for them as their tutor, but personally as regent.;x

EVENTNAME322020;First assembly of the Tyrolean diet at Meran;x
EVENTHIST322020;The league against Friedrich IV founded in July 1423 was basically doomed from the beginning. Ever since his return from his imprisonment, Friedrich IV had been seeking the support of burghers and peasantry, who had suffered much from the decade of unrest, largely despised the rebellious nobles whom they perceived to betray Tyrol to satisfy their personal greed and ambitions and therefore willingly rallied behind the popular, folksy count. Castle Greifenstein, the apparently impregnable stronghold of the Starkenberg dynasty which was among the most important adherents to the rebellion, fell to Friedrich in 1423. The decisive move happened in Meran in November 1423: for the first time in the history of Tyrol, a diet with representatives of all estates, including the burghers and the peasantry, assembled and forced the league of the nobles to surrender and dissolve. Political power was thereby shifted to Friedrich and the elements that had supported him  the lesser nobility, the burghers and the peasantry. The influence of the noble oligarchy was almost entirely broken. Oswald von Wolkenstein, their former leader, was captured and had to submit to Friedrich in 1427, and Peter Spaur, another important rebel, committed suicide when he realized that his plans had thoroughly failed.;x

Emperor Sigmund, who desired to completely break Friedrich's power, mortgaged Feldkirch to Count Friedrich of Toggenburg in 1417. Upon the latter's death on April 30th 1436, Friedrich IV managed to rebuy the pawn from the widow, Elisabeth von Matsch, for 22.000 Gulden.;x

Henry III had no son and was unlikely ever to have one. This left Henry of Navarre as heir, thereby raising the spectre that the next King of France might be a heretic. In September 1584 Henry duke of Guise and his brothers the duke of Mayenne and the Cardinal of Guise met at Nancy and founded league to keep Navarre off the throne. Philip II signed a treaty with the new League, and military operations began at once.

Jefferson and the Anti-Federalists opposed the growing government and rode the wave of popular fears of insidious royalism. Adams supporters retaliated by condemning the French Revolution as Monocracy, the former cherished by the Anti-Federalists. The Anti-Federalists on the other hand still viewed England as the principal enemy and said that Adams was going to pay lip service to Her Majesty's Government.

Initially the Federalists monopolized the media thanks to the Sedition Act that outlawed most opposition as treason. Though this Act was also the rallying point of the Anti-Federalists, or the Republicans, as they were now called as James Madison had written the controversial Virginia and Kentucky Resolution in 1798-1799 which declared the Sedition Act unconstitutional. At a late stage the majority in New York changed and the new electoral votes changed the balance into the favor of Jefferson. However as the nominally vice presidential candidate Aaron Burr got the same number of electoral votes as the Jefferson, Burr later forced the issue to a vote in the House which was eventually won by Jefferson.

Among the elites of the country many still supported the Federalists and Pinckney, but the masses were discouraged by the behavior of the Junta. The Biggest Issue was the Louisiana Purchase as Federalists feared that more immigrants (Jefferson-supporters that is) would break the balance of power at the expense of the Federalists.

The Embargo was very unpopular in both camps, thus the Federalists once again revitalized under Charles Pinckney and Free-Trade Republicans threatened to support the republican vice presidential candidate George Clinton. The Free-Trade threat never materialized and although Pinckney did well he could not compete with the popularity of former President Jefferson.

The Federalists existed, but was trashed from opposing the War of 1812 and had its voters in the New England area.

The Republicans was on the other hand an all-American movement with strong bases in New York, Virginia and in the South from which it campaign with skill and effect. Four republican presidential terms in a row had strengthened the party proportionally to the decline of the Federalists.

EVENTHIST65009;After the death of Ubaid'Allah Khan in 1539, the Uzbek empire slowly slid, due to a lack of strong personalities, into factional fighting, which culminated, after the death of Abd-al Latif in 1549, in a full scale struggle for power.;x

EVENTNAME65010;Succession of Abd al-Latif;x
EVENTHIST65010;Following the death of Abd al-Latif, a short political brawl followed, which, however, had far reaching long term consequences. Pir Muhammad quickly jumped on opportunity and captured Bukhara, however, lacking any military support, he had to flee upon hearing the news that Nawruz Ahmad is on his way. The next 7 years saw a constant figthing between Pir Muhammad nephew Abd'Allah and Nawruz Ahmad. The civil war effectively ended in 1556 when Nawruz Ahmad died of drunkeness, allowing Pir Muhammad to ascend to the throne.;x

EVENTNAME65012;Anthony Jenkinson travels to Bukhara;x
EVENTHIST65012;Anthony Jenkinson has travelled to Bukhara on behalf of both Czar Ivan IV and Muscovy Trading Company in 1558. Ivan was very interested in establishing trade contacts with Bukhara, as Muscovy served as a stopover for the goods from India and China into Western Europe.;x

EVENTNAME65023;Independence of Khiva;x
EVENTHIST65023;People of Khiva were always openly hostile to rulers of Bukhara. This hostility goes back to the times of Abu'l Khayr, when part of the tribes refused to follow him, and remained settled in the areas around Khiva and Urganj. Subsequently the area was reconquered by Muhammad Shaibani, and later on Ubaid'Allah, which didn't bring much popularity to the Bukharan rulers. The latter, however, never staked any claims to these lands, and used their military supremacy to keep Khiva vassalized, and protect the trade with Muscovy.;x

EVENTNAME65030;Death of Abul' Khair;x
EVENTHIST65030;During his long lifetime Abu'l Khair managed to create a huge empire stretching from Siberia in the North to Khiva and Urgench in the South. However, his ascension in 1428, sponsored by a wily Ulugh Beg, was never recognized by relatives of Khan Baraq, especially his sons, Jani Beg and Giray Khan. In 1460s they led the tribes of the remnants of the White Horde into the lands controlled by Abu'l Khair. Supported by the ruler of Oirats, they laid a claim to Semirech'e. Abu'l Khair didn't recognize the claim, and a conflict ensued. In 1468, a combined army of Kazakhs and Oirats defeated Abu'l Khair's forces. Both Abu'l Khair and his son Sultan Haidar were killed, and the might of Uzbeks has crumbled. The power has passed into the hands of Abu'l Khair grandson Shaibani, who had to flee and live in exile for a long time, before he could reassemble the Uzbek clans.;x
#;x
EVENTNAME65031;Death of Shaibani;x
EVENTHIST65031;Muhammad Shaibani was able to return from his exile and re-assemble the scattered Uzbek clans only after the death of Jani Beg in 1480. However, he quickly made Uzbeks a power to be reckoned with again, just like during the days of his grandfather, Abu'l Khair. He managed to clear the remaining Timurid princes out of Transoxiana, defeated and drove Babur out of Samarqand, and expanded as far south as Herat when he expelled the last Timurid ruler, Hussain BayKarah. That brough him into a conflict with a Shiite ruler of Iran, Shah Ismail. Not only the lands were at stake, but religion as well. In 1510, Ismail managed to lure Shaibani into an ambush and had him killed. His skull was stuffed with straw and sent to Ottoman Sultan Bayezid. With the death of Shaibani, the power in the Khanate was split between Samarqand and Bukhara, with two Khans ruling simultaneously. Uzbeks has lost their offensive momentum for the next 20 years, but regained it for a short period of time during the rule of the 'Warrior Khan' Ubaid'Allah.;x
#;x
EVENTNAME325000;Formation of Khiva Khanate;x
EVENTHIST325000;While Shaibani Khan was busy conquering the Timurid states of Central Asia and Khorasan, the nomadic Uzbeks in the west became restless. In 1511, the two sultans, Ilbars and Balbars conquered the Khwarazm region and founded the Khiva Khanate. Unsurprisingly, this Khanate would become a thorn in the side of the late Bukhara Khanate and was frequently at odds with it.;x

EVENTNAME325004;Independence of the Uzbeks;x
EVENTHIST325004;In 1428, Abul Khayr was declared khan of the Uzbek people in Sibir (near-modern day Tobolsk). His reign marked a separation of Uzbek and Golden Horde foreign policies into two entirely different categories. The Uzbeks were free to pursue their interests which would be determined to lie within the regions of Khwarizm and Transoxiana. From Khayr's beginning, the Shaybanid dynasty would eventually carve a large empire and a name into history for themselves.;x

EVENTNAME325005;The Uzbek Peoples;x
EVENTHIST325005;When Abul Khayr conquered Khwarizm, he sent into motion the events that would contribute to the fall of the Timurid Empire and the rise of Uzbek Khanates. Their culture had begun to differ from those of other Mongols prior to Khayr's conquest, and his efforts allowed the Uzbek peoples to declare their complete independence. From now on, with the help of their Turkoman allies, the destiny of the Uzbeks would lie in the south, not in the north.;x

EVENTNAME325008;The Formation of the Sibir Khanate;x
EVENTHIST325008;Following the disintegration of the Horde, descendents of On Khan formed the Khanate of Sibir, near the modern day city of Tyumen. They quickly established their domain, which existed from Kurgan in the west, to Ichim in the east. This Khanate would survive well into the 16th century until it was extinguished by Cossacks from Russia.;x

EVENTNAME325009;The Oirat Invasion;x
EVENTHIST325009;Starting around the mid-15th century, Khayr's eastern lands came under attack from the Oirats, a people of Mughulistan. The Oirats pillaged and destroyed much of the east and are mainly responsible for the lack of expansion during the rest of Khayr's reign. Eventually, the actions of Oirats, would allow the Kazakh Horde to break free from the weakened Uzbek Khanate.;x

EVENTHIST325013;In 1468, both Abu'l Khayr and his son, Sheikh Haidar, were killed in a battle versus the breakaway Kazakhs. A temporary peace, between the Kazakhs and Uzbeks, allowed Shaibani Khan, Abu'l Khayr's grandson, to turn his attentions to the south. By the early 16th century he lead an invasion force of nomadic Uzbek tribes to conquer the region known as Transoxiana, 'that which lies beyond the Oxus river'.;x

Failing, he later tried to seize Bukhara, another failure which ended in his imprisonment. However, upon the assaisnation of 'Abd al-Latîf, he was released and proclaimed ruler by the nobles and clergy of Samarkand. In June of 1451, with the help of Abul Khayr, he defeated the forces of 'Abd Allâh Mîrzâ. Sa'id lavished Khayr with gifts, including Ûlûgh Beg's daughter in marriage.;x

EVENTNAME3637;The Ottoman claim on Cyprus;x
EVENTHIST3637;The fall of Alexandria and the Levant trade into Ottoman hands was a disaster for Venice. The spice trade decayed even further, and the sale of Central European silver to the Mamluks stopped, leading to an overabundance of the precious metal that caused inflation. Worse than that, Venetian trade was now in the hands of the Ottomans, that periodically attacked Venice depriving her from her most precious possessions. In the war of 1463-1479 Venice lost Scodra, Kroja, Negroponte and Lemnos. In the war of 1499-1503 Venice lost Modon, Coron, Lepanto, Navarino, and Durazzo. The fall of Egypt has brought a new source of conflict. When the Venetians managed to get control of Cyprus, they offered to continue paying a tribute to the Mamluk Bey, theoretical suzerain of the island, to maintain privileged commercial relations with Egypt. It was a mistake, as now the Sultan of the Ottomans claims lordship over Cyprus and requests that the tribute is paid to him in gold instead of cloths as we used to do. Venice accepted to pay, but dispatched Giovanni Sammichele and Giulio Savorgnan, his best military engineers, to strengthen the fortifications at Cyprus, knowing that the Turks would eventually attack the island.;x

EVENTHIST5228;Galileo continued his work on motion and on mechanics, and began to get involved in disputes about Copernicanism. Galileo showed a marked tendency to use all his discoveries as evidence for Copernicanism, and to do so with great verbal as well as mathematical skill. Copernicanism was in contradiction with Scripture, and in 1616 Galileo was given some kind of secret, but official, warning that he was not to defend Copernicanism. Just what was said on this occasion was to become a subject for dispute when Galileo was accused of departing from this undertaking in his 'Dialogue concerning the two greatest world systems', published in 1632.;x
#;x
EVENTHIST5229;Galileo was born in Pisa in Tuscany. He is chiefly remembered for his work on free fall, his use of the telescope and his employment of experimentation. In 1592 Galileo was appointed professor of mathematics at the university of Padua (the university of the Republic of Venice). There his duties were to teach Euclid's geometry and astronomy. In the summer of 1609 Galileo made a series of telescopes. The astronomical discoveries he made with his telescopes were described in a book called 'Messenger from the stars' (Sidereus Nuncius) published in Venice in May 1610. Galileo claimed to have seen mountains on the Moon, to have proved the Milky Way was made up of tiny stars, and to have seen four small bodies orbiting Jupiter. These last, with an eye on getting a job in Florence, he promptly named 'the Medicean stars'.;x

He prophesied that if they continued in this wise, that Venice would prosper, but that if they did not refrain, as if from fire, from taking what belongs to others or making unjust wars, that Venice would see nothing but strife, and war, and loss.

Carmagnola was one of the most noted mercenaries, or Condotierri, of his day. He faithfully served Milan for years until he felt he was being replaced by the young Francesco Sforza.

EVENTNAME17006;Council of Ten;x
EVENTHIST17006;The Venetian Republic had an almost ridiculously complex series of checks and balances to ensure fair elections and discourage power resting with a single man. Normal business passed through normal channels, but the collegio could refer urgent matters to the Council of Ten which had extraordinary powers to cut red-tape and by-pass the slow moving senate. The Council of Ten (17 in reality, as it included the Doge and his Signoria, or cabinet) was authorized to act on its own initiative, make payments out of clandestive funds, and its field of competence covered the security of the state and the preservation of morals. In 1537, the Ten established the Esecutori contra la Bestemmia to suppress vice.;x

Unfortunately, Francesco was married to the morosely pious Archduchess Joanna of Austria. The Old Duke died, and the bank clerk was killed in a street brawl. The new Duke installed Bianca in his palace as his mistress. Joanna died in childbirth, and in less than two months Francesco and Bianca were married.

This matter brought to a head conflict that was already brewing with the church over the right to appoint a Patriach, taxes, and church properties in Venice. The Pope pronounced a sentence of excommunication, and laid an interdict on Venice. Venice turned to Paolo Sarpi, a theologian, expert in canon law, dialectician, scientist, and political philosopher to argue their case. Also, King Henry IV was asked to mediate with the Pope. The Papacy tried to save face, but it was clear that the interdict had failed. Never again would the Pope attempt to interdict a nation, and papal authority over Catholic Europe suffered a blow from which it could never quite recover.;x

EVENTNAME17010;The Spanish conspiracy;x
EVENTHIST17010;During 1615, Doge Giovanni Bembo, hero of Lepanto, initiated an agressive policy against the Austrian Habsburgs in the war of Gradisca (Uskok war), and supported Savoy in her fights with the Spanish Habsburgs in Milan. The Spanish reprisal was the authorization to the Duke of Osuna, Viceroy of Naples, to attack Venice in the Adriatic with his private fleet under his own banner during the 1617 season. Venice protested these attacks, but the King of Spain privately supported Osuna despite his public repudiation. In November 1617 the peace between Austria and Venice was signed in Madrid, and although Gradisca remained in Austrian hands, the Uskok problem was solved. Then, right after the deaths of Doge Bembo and his successor in two months, in May 1618 the Council of Ten ordered the execution of 300 French and Spaniards working for Venice at the Arsenal. Venice was shaken by the bloodiest incident in her history, and a rumor started that a great danger had been avoided. Although no solid evidence was provided, the Signoria claimed that Osuna had tried to take over the city from the inside, but that the plot had been uncovered by one of the implicated. Amidst public outcry, the Spanish ambassador, the Marquis of Bedmar, had to leave Venice, while one of Osuna's agents, the immortal writer Francisco de Quevedo, narrowly escaped death. Some Venetian nobles were exiled. Wether the conspiracy was such, or some covert operation aborted is still debated. Osuna fell out of favour a couple of years later, and was recalled to Spain to die in 1624 in confinment without judgement, while Venice initiated a more peaceful period.;x

EVENTNAME17011;Zen Against the Doge;x
EVENTHIST17011;In 1627, Renier Zen, a Capi of the Council of Ten, emerged as a vocal critic of the Doge, Cornaro, accusing him of running Venice for his own family's benefit by, among other things, turning a blind eye to his son Giorgio's trafficking in contraband goods. On October 27, Zen caused an uproar at a meeting of the Great Council by accusing the Cornaro family of corruption, although the elections were annulled, he was unable to obtain any further sanctions. On December 30, Renier Zen was attacked by masked assassins, who were later found to include Giorgio Cornaro, the son of the Doge. Zen grew even more outspoken in his criticism of Cornaro in the wake of Giorgio Cornaro's failed assassination attempt. Venice now became divided into two factions, a pro-Conaro faction that was pro-papal and backed by the Venetian oligarchs, and a pro-Zen faction that was anti-papal and backed by the poorer nobility. Rioting broke out between the two factions on July 23, 1628, and for the rest of Cornaro's life, Venice was locked in a civil war. The Venetian government had basically broken down by late 1628.;x

EVENTNAME17015;Silver Crisis;x
EVENTHIST17015;The only significant sources of silver left operating in Europe in early 1420s were mines at Srebrenica in Bosnia and Novo Brdo in soutern Serbia, and they shipped most of their production through the Venetian ports and fortresses that controlled the coast of Dalmatia, with an average outflow of about 20 tonnes of silver a year. As the Bosnian mines declined in the 1430s, the stage was set for a financial disaster, completed when the Turks overran the Serbian silver mines in 1455, and in 1460 captured the last Bosnian mine. The last Venetian silver grosso was minted in 1462. On 17th March 1464 Venice sent all the city's spare cash with the galleys to trade with Syria, leaving nothing in the city treasury but small and debased coins. The bullion crisis reached a point where trade was strangled. Compounding the problem, a genuine fear that creditors would be unable to find money to pay bills led to a restriction for credit. Such fears were real: several Venetian banks failed, and so did the Strozzi bank of Florence, the second largest in the city. Even the smallest of small change became scarce. But the crisis didn't last long. In the late 1450s, Martin Claus of Gotha solved the problem of the flooded silver mines of Saxony, just as Europe ran out of currency. The old mines quickly re-opened, and new discoveries were made in the Harz Mountains (the Erzgebirge). Thereafter, Saxon and Bohemian mining resumed at full scale from mines such as Kutná Hora, Freiberg, and Rammelsberg, and new mines were opened in other regions: at Schneeberg in Saxony and at Schwats in the Tirol, which was discovered in 1448. New supplies of bullion reached European economies, beginning in the 1460s, but especially in the 1470s and 1480s.;x
#;x
EVENTNAME17016;Copper coins;x
EVENTHIST17016;Having learned from the coin crisis of 1465, the Venetians began minting pure copper coins for everyday use in 1473. The coins were good coinage, that is, they were worth almost exactly what the copper in them was worth. The Venetians were able to do this because new copper mines had opened in the Alps and Carpathians, and Venice was well placed to trade in the metal.;x

EVENTNAME17017;Seeing a Chance in Romagna;x
EVENTHIST17017;Venice, shorn suddenly of her commercial hegemony, bereft of friends or allies, under continual and increasing threat from the Turks in the East and the princes of Europe in the West, it seemed to her that her only long-term hope of survival lay in building up a broad mainland bulwark. Thus, when the dispossessed lords of cities that had fallen to Cesare Borgia sought refuge in Venetian territory, she had immediately offered them sympathy and shelter. And when, seeing Cesare facing a crisis in his fortunes, these nobles made determined and more or less simultaneous bids to reinstate themselves, she gave them her active support - always provided that they would accept her as their overlord and govern in her name. By the end of 1503 the banner of St Mark was already floating over Russi and Forlimpopoli, Rimini, Cervia, and Faenza. - John Norwich, A History of Venice, New York, 1989. Taking possession of Rimini, Faenza, and a number of other cities, Venice strengthened her position below the Po River where the city of Ravenna worked as strategic outpost since 1431. But Julius II, having secured his own control of the Papal armies by arresting and imprisoning il Valentino, quickly moved to re-establish Papal control over the Romagna (since it was amongst the territories ceded to the Holy See by Pepin III in 752 in what constituted the original Papal States) by demanding that Venice return the cities she had seized. Venice refused to surrender the cities, although willing to acknowledge Papal sovereignty over them and pay an annual tribute to the Holy See. After having unsuccessfully induced Venice to abandon Romagna by means of a Papal bull, the resolute Julius II began to look for allies. Only in September 1504 at Blois where Louis XII of France stipulated a treaty with which he renounced his claims over Naples in favour of Spain for the investiture of the Duchy of Milan, at the presence of the Emperor and the Archduke of Burgundy Philippe le Beau, the Pope let them include a secret paragraph by which the signatories would have allied against Venice. In facts Julius II did not possess sufficient forces to fight Venice even if for the next two years he recovered a few small towns in Romagna and managed to bring under Papal rule, Bologna and Perugia, both only nominally subject to the church and also to re-establish the order in Rome by means of political marriages between his family, the Della Rovere, and the rival factions of Colonna and Orsini.;x

For his phenomenal energy in painting he was termed Il Furioso, the furious, and his dramatic use of perspectival space and special lighting effects make him a precursor of baroque art.;x

Foscari had powerful enemies that were economically harmed by his policies, and the conduct of his only son Jacopo opened his flank to their attack. Jacopo Foscari was tried by the Council of Ten three times between 1444 and 1456 for accepting bribes, murder and treason. He was treated with relative leniency given the seriousness of the accusations, in part because the worst between them, that of murdering a respected senator, could not be proved. He was first banished from the city, then exiled in Crete and finally imprisoned for a year, before dying in exile in 1457.;x

He was further humiliated when the Council of Ten forced his resignation, taking from him the symbols of power and expelling him from the Ducal Palace. Two days after his successor was elected, he died. The discontent between the venetians for this unnecessary mistreatment was so big that the Council of Ten confiscated the corpse from the family and dressed him in the dogal garments for his state funeral, and had his successor and opponent, Pasquale Malipiero, walk behind in senatorial dress. Despite the masquerade, a year later, the High Council passed a law limiting the power of the Council of Ten in matters regarding the Doge and his provisions, and publicly reprimanded the Council.;x

Venice chartered some Dutch and British ships, and adopted merchant ships for military purposes. After this the first line ship was built in the Arsenal in 1667, to the design of a British ship.

But Milan and her dependency, Genoa, were also seen as the key to Italy but the Frence presence in Northern Italy would mean a constant menace to the balance of powers, expecially to the Emperor and its Italian fiefs. So Louis XII, preparing to make good his claim on Milan, wanted to enlist the help of the main Italian powers, to avoid the mistakes of his cousin Charles VIII. In the meanwhile the anti-Venetian sentiment had been running high, attempts were made by Italian ambassadors to poison the relationships between Venice and the Ottoman Empire and try to induce the latter to declare war to the former. It was clear that Venice could very well side with the French and that occurred with the stipulation of the treaty of Blois, where Venice would recognize French claims to Milan whilst France would acknowledge Venetian claims to the territories east of the Adda River and beyond Lower Po Valley.;x

As a result of this the city of Milan proclaimed the Republic giving the high military command to Francesco Sforza on the purpose to stop Venice from the eastern borders profiting from the Milanese crisis by expanding her dominions beyond Adda River. After 2 years and half of life, isolated and surrounded by the unfaithful Sforza, who in the meanwhile and with the support of Venice turned against the city of Milan aiming at the ducal throne, the Ambrosian Republic eventually ceased to exist. Brought to severe famine the citizenship of Milan was forced to surrender to the condottiero and accept him as their new Duke. As soon as Sforza proclaimed himself successor of Visconti to the throne of Milan and the Holy Roman Emperor didn't acknowledge him the ducal investiture, the war of succession inevitably began. Encouraged by that and as to continued her war of conquest Venice tried to renew her old alliance with Florence.

They ordered an secret embassy sent to the Mameluk Sultan to try and negotiate that duties on spices and Indian goods be lowered to make the Venetians competitive with the Portuguese. When the Sultan refused they then agreed to supply the timber for the fleet that the Sultan wanted to build to fight the Portuguese.

A few years later she became the kadin or favourite of Selim the Sot, and after he died she became the Valide Sultan, or mother of the reigning Sultan, Murad III. The Valide Sultan was the third most influential position in the Ottoman Empire, after the Sultan and the Grand Vizier, and during the 130 years of the Kadinlar Sultanati, or Reign of Women, they often controlled the Sultan.

EVENTNAME326031;Dominican Inquisition;x
EVENTHIST326031;The independent attitude of the Republic in matters ecclesiastical is illustrated in the position occupied by the Inquisition at Venice in 1468. When the Pope, with a view to crushing the Albigensian and Patarinian heresies, endeavoured to establish everywhere in Italy the Dominican Inquisition, the Republic resisted its introduction into Venice. The State charged itself to discover heretics, who when caught were examined by the Patriarch, the Bishop of Castello, or any other Venetian Ordinary. The examining Court was confined to a return of fact. It was called on to state whether the examinee was or was not guilty of heresy. Punishment was reserved to the secular authority. This arrangement did not satisfy the Court of Rome, an Inquisitor was appointed by the Pope, but he required the Doge's exequatur before he could act, and a board was created of three Venetian nobles, to sit as assessors to the Holy Office. Their duty was to guard the rights of Venetian citizens against ecclesiastical encroachment, including the non-interference in religious matters within the colonies, without their presence and their sanction no act of the Holy Office was valid in Venice. The Inquisition in Venice was certainly no sanguinary Office, thanks no doubt in a large degree to the independent attitude of the State, which insisted upon the presence of lay assessors at every trial.;x

EVENTHIST326032;Antonio Pigafetta belonged to a rich family of Vicenza. In his youth he studied astronomy, geography and cartography. He served on board the galleys of the order of St. John at the beginning of 16th century. In 1519 he accompanied the Papal Nuncio, Monsignor Chieregati, to Spain where he was presented to the Emperor Carlos I (V). There he heard of the trip of Magellan and negotiated to be admitted as a paying passenger, a supernumerary. In spite of initial difficulties with Magellan, he managed to gain his confidence and served as a chronicler and cartographer for him. During the trip, Pigafetta collected information about geography, the climate, the flora, the fauna and the inhabitants of the visited places. His meticulous notes were to serve as invaluable documents to future explorers and cartographers, mainly due to their focus on nautical and linguistic data. In the battle at Mactan, Philippines, in which Magellan was killed, Pigafetta also was hurt. Nevertheless, he managed to recover and was among the 18 on board the Victoria who accompanied Juan Sebastián Elcano in his return to Spain. After reaching port in Sanlúcar de Barrameda (Cadiz) in September of 1522, three years after his departure, he recollected his experiences in 'Relations of the First Round-the-world Trip', composed in Italian and published in Venice. After that voyage Pigafetta returned to Italy where he died in his native city in 1534.;x

EVENTNAME326038;The Treaty of Lodi;x
EVENTHIST326038;During the war of succession in Milan, all the belligerent nations were brought to exhaustion of money and troops. Francesco Sforza, ruler of Milan and Venice, the chief state of the league confederates, who was more and more threatened by the advancing Ottomans in her eastern Mediterranean territories, convened a cease-fire while a bilateral treaty was hastily signed in Lodi on 7 April 1454. With that treaty Sforza was legitimated Duke of Milan. Without even being called for, Florence and the Pope had no choice then to endorse the treaty. The King of Naples, being a rightful claimant on the ducal throne reluctantly joined the alliance under the condition to keep Genoa out of it. Intended 'infra terminos italicos', that treaty showed the objective impossibility for all the Italian major powers (specifically Milan, Tuscany, Venice, Naples and Papal States) to prevail upon each other in the struggle for the hegemony in Italy and that the better solution was to come to terms with each other. That would have also avoided the practice of very expensive and pointless wars in the next future. Although the treaty actually played a minor part in Italian balance of powers and so won't be able to avoid future wars of aggression from inside as well from outside Italy, the post-Lodi era historically represented a period of relative peace in which the figurative arts definitively flourished in the whole Italian peninsula, as well as economy and trade and, last but not the least, the skills and tricks of the art of diplomacy.;x

EVENTNAME326040;The Gheto;x
EVENTHIST326040;Around X century the Jews who came to Venice were usually merchants and moneylenders. Until the end of XIII century they weren't even allowed to settle in the city with the exception of the island of Spinalunga, later known as Giudecca. In 1394 only the Jews who were not moneylenders were allowed to remain in the city, the others were expelled. However they were forced to certain restrictions, like wearing various markings on their clothing to identify themselves as Jews (generally yellow badges or hats, changed in red in 1500). Jews weren't allowed to own lands and build synagogues, they were even forced to attend Christian services or become baptized and often subjet to anti-Jewish aggressions. Following the expulsion from Spain and Portugal in 1492 lots of Jewish immigrants came to Venice and decisions had to be taken about whether Jews should be allowed to remain in the city. On 29 March 1516 the Council of Ten decreed to let the Jews remain, however their residence would be confined to Ghetto Nuovo (New Ghetto), a small, dirty island of Cannaregio sestiere (a quartier in Venice) named after the Venetian word 'Gheto' meaning 'casting' for the iron foundries located there in those centuries and pronunced with a hard 'g' by the German Jews, who first settled there. The area was then isolated by wide surrounding canals and linked to the rest of the city by means of two bridges, which were closed by Christian guards at night and during certain Christian festivals, when all Jews were required to stay away. In Venice Jews were only permitted to work at pawn shops, act as moneylenders, trade in second hand goods or practice medicine and in order to leave the Ghetto at day they had to wear distinguishing marks or hats. In 1541, Jewish immigrations from the Levant, Spain and Portugal increased the population of the Ghetto so that, even if many six-story 'skyscrapers' had been built because of the lack of space, the quarter was enlarged to the neighbouring area, the Ghetto Vecchio (Old Ghetto). Despite the poor living conditions, Jewish community life in the Ghettp continued to grow, centered around Jewish rituals, customs and celebrations in synagogues built on buildings' top floors in respect of local laws which forbade synagogues in separate buildings. After 1630, when the Jewish population of Venice reached 5,000 inhabitants, the Ghetto's boundaries extended to the Ghetto Nuovissimo.;x

EVENTNAME326041;The battle of Lepanto;x
EVENTHIST326041;The loss of Cyprus in 1571, triggered the formation of a Holy League, mainly formed by Spain, Venice and Papal States, with the combined fleet under command of Don Juan de Austria. The interests of Venice and Spain were very different: Venice wanted to recover Cyprus, and Spain wanted to recover her North African presidios, and they could only agree in fighting the Ottoman navy. The ensuing battle at Lepanto was the biggest naval battle in modern times with over 32,000 casualties (by comparison Trafalgar had only 3,000), 25,000 of them in the Ottoman side. The Ottoman fleet was almost completely destroyed. News of the victory were extremely well received by the Christians that suffered the Ottoman and Barbary piracy. Although the Ottomans rebuilt their fleet and recaptured Tunis a second time in 1574, their naval supremacy in the Mediterranean was destroyed forever.;x

His later career brought involvement in opera. As a composer Vivaldi was prolific, with some 500 concertos to his credit, in addition to a quantity of works for the church and for the theatre. He left Venice in 1741 in the apparent hope of finding new patrons in Vienna, where he died shortly after his arrival in the city.;x

Further commissions followed, from Bologna, Ferrara, Venice again and Milan. His first operas to win international acclaim come from 1813, written for different Venetian theatres: the serious 'Tancredi' and the comic 'L'italiana in Algieri', the one showing a fusion of lyrical expression and dramatic needs, with its crystalline melodies, arresting harmonic inflections and colourful orchestral writing, the other moving easily between the sentimental, the patriotic, the absurd and the sheer lunatic. In 1815 Rossini went to Naples as musical and artistic director of the Teatro San Carlo, which led to a concentration on serious opera.;x

Stemming from the 16th century sword of the Venetian Doge guard, the name came from the fact that the guards consisted largely of Dalmatian Slavs (Schiavoni). Classified as a true broadsword this war sword had a wider blade than its contemporary infantry rapiers. The Schiavona was basket hilted and double edged. During the 17th century, due to the trade with northern Italy, the Schiavona won a huge popularity in all other European armies. Later fitted with a long blade, it became the favourite sword of all the heavy cavalry.;x

The final death blow was dealt to Venice by an unexpected side: France, a republic like Venice itself ignored the wish of Venice to stay neutral in the conflict between France and Austria. Soon french troops invaded northern italy and successfully forced the austrian forces out of Milan - and chased them even across venetian territorry - and discovering that Venice lacked the power to deny them anything the french general Napoleon Bonaparte despite his own italian origins as Napoleone Buonaparte decided to take what noone could deny him.

EVENTHIST326049;Turkish control of the strategic Morean peninsula was necessary for Mehmed's own project of tackling Italy in time. Therefore, the great sultan personally led campaigns in 1458 and again in 1460 that extinguished the last remnants of Byzantine sovereignty in the Morea. The definitive annexation of the peninsula by Turkey deprived the Christian west of its most valuable base for any anti-Turkish crusade. Venetian involvement in the Morea was always present and due to the anarchy prevailing in the Morea prior to 1423, made Venice decide to acquire the entire peninsula. Many meetings between Venetian envoys and envoys representing emperor Manuel and Theodore II of Morea came to nothing. Although the Venetian republic failed to annex the Morea in 1423, it strengthened and enlarged its valuable Morean colonies. From 1423, Venice acquired the castle of Grisi midway between Modon and Coron and also purchased Port-de Jonc to go with its previous purchases of Lepanto, Patras and Messenia. With the fall of Morea, Venice decided to step up its claim on the peninsula.;x

The latter was an epoch-making conflict of empires and civilisations at the height of their powers - in political and military terms Venice was actually the greatest Christian power active in the Levant. After 1640, when it became clear that the Turks had set their sights on Candia, Venice mobilised a formidable fleet, which included ships of galleys, galleasses and galleons for a fleet total of 120. In the course of 24 years of war the Venetians were generally on the offensive, often achieving stunning victories, including preventing the ability of the Turks to organise convoys of reinforcements for Crete. On prior commencement to the conflict, Venice sent 33000 troops to Crete of which 12000 where mercenaries from Hanover, Brunswick and Cleves, a further 5000 Venetian troops where sent to Dalmatia.;x

EVENTHIST326052;The Treviso Arithmetic, or Arte dell'Abbaco, is a Venetian mathematics textbook written by an anonymous teacher in Treviso, Italy in 1478. The Treviso Arithmetic is the earliest known printed mathematics book in the West, and one of the first printed European textbooks dealing with a science. The Treviso Arithmetic is a practical book intended for self study and for use in Venetian trade. It is written in the Venetian language and communicated knowledge to a large population. It helped to end the monopoly on mathematical knowledge and gave important information to the middle class. It was not written for a large audience, but intended to teach mathematics of everyday currency in Italy. The Treviso became one of the first mathematics books that were written for the expansion of human knowledge. It gave opportunity for the common person to learn the art of computation instead of only a privileged few. The Treviso Arithmetic provided an early example of the Hindu-Arabic numeral system and computational algorithms.;x

The Republic was becoming more and more alarmed by the ambitious plan of Visconti to submit the weak Lordships in Northern Italy. The Milanese attacks on Romagna and the presumptive defection of the great condottiero Carmagnola from the Milanese troops definitely pressed the war-like tempered doge to give full support to Florence who invoked a League as an attempt to stop the Milanese hegemonic threat towards south. The new political situation gave Venice the opportunity to expand in the Milanese ducal territories with the support of her allies who feared the Milanese expansionism above all.

In the end the High Council realised that prohibition was not the best way to act and decided to at least reap some benefit from the situation: in 1638 the first public gambling house was thus opened. This was the 'Ridotto' in Palazzo Dandolo near San Moisè, just a few steps from St Marks Square and from the southern access to the Grand Canal. Thanks to this the Republic collected a huge flow of cash otherwise destined for private coffers.;x

EVENTHIST326056;In XVIIIthe century the 'Ridotto' was one of the city's main attractions and had enormous international renown, alongside that of the Venetian carnival. People visiting the Ridotto were generally curious visitors, nobles and courtesans, pimps and prostitutes, usurers and police informants, but in most case just degenerate gamblers of every social background. Except for the croupiers and the Barnabots, impoverished Venetian noblemen, all visitors were obliged to wear three-cornered hats, capes and masks in order to access incognito the gambling places. The Ridotto was open to the public only during carnival, which could often last six months in Venice, from October to February-March. In 1774, because of many concerns about frequent nobles' gambling problems the High Council voted on a motion aiming at 'the preservation of piety, sound discipline and moderate behaviour' and the Ridotto was definitively closed. The city stood terribly shocked with great damage to the profits of pimps, usurers, hosts, shop-keepers, mask-makers and Barnabot noblemen.

EVENTNAME326057;The stone bridge of Rialto;x
EVENTHIST326057;Until the XIIIth century Venice was built on a group of islands separated by channels. Access across the bodies of water was enabled through the installation of wooden planks. As time passed, many bridges were constructed in Venice, but none connecting the banks of the Grand Canal. This was a rather big problem for the city, and the population would always tease the High Council about it. To prevent the humiliation, a wooden bridge across the Grand Canal was set up in Rialto, in the heart of Venice, named La Pónt. However, upkeep costs were high due to frequent restorations of the partially submerged, rapidly rotting, and in 1524 collapsed La Pónt. To solve this problem the High Council decided to call in some of the best architects in all of Italy: Andrea Palladio and Vincenzo Scamozzi. Both architects presented drawings of a bridge featuring three great arches, all ending in the centre of the bridge, where a kettledrum sustained by huge columns was to be installed. In spite of the great fame of both architects and the magnificence of their plans a project by Antonio da Ponte would win. His suggestion was a unique arch bridge, 48 meters long, 22 meters wide, and high enough to allow boats to pass under, and it was immediately chosen, discarding Palladio's majestic project. Construction was started in 1588, and it took some years to finally join the opposite parts of the Grand Canal, finally replacing La Pónt, who would only live on in Vittore Carpaccio's famous painting 'The Healing of the Obsessed'.;x

EVENTNAME326058;The Water Supervisors;x
EVENTHIST326058;Since early times, the Serenissima has always been threatened by the silting up of the lagoon because of the negative effect it could have had on the city of Venice, whose safety and prosperity were indissolubly linked to the existence of the lagoon around her. Since XIIth century plain water-courses were embanked in order to limit the erosion and the consequent transport of sediments to the lagoon, but these works did not bring the expected results and it was therefore decided to face the problem radically deflecting the rivers that flew into the lagoon. In 1501 for that particular purpose the High Council formed a committee of three 'Savi alle Acque' (The Water Supervisors). Starting from 1551 the first river to be deflected was the Brenta, then the Bacchiglione, the Piave, the Sile, the Adige and even the Po River, all of them potentially dangerous to the status quo of the lagoon. During the next two centuries to some extent all these rivers were deflected from their old courses to the seaside, outside the lagoon. The silting up of the lagoon was actually slowed down, but at the same time both the erosion and the withdrawing of the salt-marshes increased.;x

EVENTNAME326059;The construction of the Murazzi;x
EVENTHIST326059;The littorals of the Venetian lagoons were continuously involved by destructive phenomena such as marine and eolian erosion. In 1738 the Republic of Venice realised along the littorals of Malamocco, Pellestrina and Sottomarina the so-called 'Murazzi': sea defensive works made up of Istrian stone and 'pozzolana'. They were jetties whose aim was to create a barrier to prevent the sea from attacking and eroding the banks. The idea of building these defensive works was conceived in 1716 by Father Vincenzo Coronelli. He sent the 'Savii d'acue' ('Savi alle Acque' in Italian), main office in charge of civilian public works, his innovative project, in which he proposed to substitute the traditional sea defensive works made up of oak trunks and filling material with a real staircase made up of Istrian stone blocks. But it was the Water, Rivers, and Lagoon supervisor Bernardino Zendrini who carried out this project thanks to the employ of 'pozzolana', a recently discovered material which solidifies when it is mixed to lime and if it comes in touch with water. This way the Istrian stone blocks welded with each other and made the 'Murazzi' barrier even more effective.;x

The first written reference to a gondola dates to the XIth century, and at the height of their popularity in the XVIIth century, more than 5,000 gondolas were active on Venice's waterways. They were made slim to maneuver the narrowest canals and topped with 'felzi', small cabins that allowed to travel incognito. Originally the color of gondolas wasn't regulated, though they were predominantly black from the pitch used to keep them water tight. When in the XVIth century private boats started to become exceptionally lavish and larger as much as to block circulation, sumptuary laws were enacted mandating that they be the uniform black and sized 11m x 1,75m x 70 Kgs.;x

EVENTHIST326066;Michiel Sanmicheli, like Jacopo Sansovino was a salaried official of the Republic of Venice, but unlike Sansovino, his commissions lay in Venetian territories outside Venice, he was no less distinguished as a military architect, and was employed in 1535 in charge of all fortifications of the Republic, not just in the Venetian lagoon, but on the mainland and in Venice's possessions in the eastern Mediterranean, including Crete, Candia, Dalmatia, Istria and Corfu. His largest project for Venice was Fortezza di Sant'Andrea (1545), defending the Lido entrance to the Venetian lagoon. In visiting Cyprus and Crete for the Serenissima Sanmicheli is probably the only practicing Italian architect of the sixteenth century to have had the opportunity to see Greek architecture, a possible source for his use of Roman Doric columns without bases. It was in the military field that Sanmicheli's career was first influenced by the Cornaro family. Girolamo Cornaro, then newly installed as Capitano (military commander) at Padua, encountered Sanmicheli in 1538 as architect for the famous fortification there that became known as Bastion Cornaro. In the following year he also commissioned Sanmicheli to design a new palace, Villa Cornaro. Later, Girolamo's brother Giovanni Cornaro commissioned Sanmicheli to design a new atrium for Ca' Lando-Cornaro (later known as Ca' Cornaro-Spinelli) on the Grand Canal in Venice. The Sanmicheli designed Ca' Cornaro was constructed in 1555. The second great Venetian palazzo designed by Sanmicheli was Ca' Grimani, constructed on the Grand Canal in the late 1550s for the late Doge Grimani family. Sanmicheli outlined his ideas on classical architecture in a book titled, The Five Orders of Architecture. He closed his career with the design of the circular Church of the Madonna di Campagna near Verona, 1559.;x

But Emo realising that decay had set in with Venetian shipping since 1720, convened a conference in 1775 in upgrading the naval arm similar to that of England's. During the next decade, Angelo Emo reorganised the extensive dockyard of the Republic, he occupied the highest posts in the Magistracy and redirected money that was to be used for defensive maintenance. Soon after, he was once more engaged to suppress the rising power of the Barbary corsairs. Eventually, the Venetian Republic declared war on the Bey of Tunis and, on 27 June 1784, the newly built fleet sailed down the Adriatic under the supreme command of Emo. Between October 1784 and October 1786 the Venetian fleet bombarded and razed to the ground Tunis and La Goletta, Susa, Sfax and Bizerta. Highly effective during this operation were the floating batteries which could move close to the target, and which were of Emo's own invention. As a result of this campaign, the freedom of trade in the Mediterranean was assured, and by his military successes the Venetian admiral consolidated his honoured place in the annals of the Republic that gave him birth.;x

The second, most famous, occasion was on April 27, 1509, by order of Pope Julius II. Another earlier Interdict was on the death of the last of the Da Polenta family, Ostasio III, who was ousted by the Republic of Venice in 1441 with aid by the Romagnan people, the city was then annexed to the Venetian territories.

EVENTNAME326080;Venetian Greeks;x
EVENTHIST326080;By 1718 having lost the Morea for the second time as well as Crete 50 years earlier, the Venetians had no more Greek militia to use except for the Greeks of Corfu and the Ionian islands. These Greeks where barely enough to defend their islands and where always propped up by the Venetian military. Venice now only had its Dalmatian militia as well as the expensive hire of German or Dutch mercenaries left.;x

EVENTHIST326081;In 1646 and 1684, 70 and 48 new families respectively paid to be registered in the Golden book of Venetian nobles and obtain a vote in the council. Of these new families many by 1700 had fallen to desperate financial problems. This condition of fallen nobility was termed Barnabotti due to these nobles meeting in the area of Campo San Barnaba. Barnabotti who, despite having lost many of their financial resources, continued to maintain the right to sit on the Greater Council, continued to vote in the assembly and decided the fate of the city and the state. Clothing and food for the Barnabotti was provided by the state. The barnabotti had frequent conflicts with the remaining body of the wealthy nobility, but at the same time, because of their lack of economic means, sold their votes and this caused certain unwanted nobles to achieve certain positions of power. In 1740, Doge Alvise Pisani tried to amend the voting regulations of the Nobles, remove the votes of the barnabotti and amend the constitution but was outvoted by the Venetian council.;x

To gain access to fight the Council of Ten, Anzolo Querini became the Chief State Prosecutor, Avogadore di Comun, with this power, Anzolo swayed the vote of the nobles to amend the constitution to share the wealth of all the nobles, remove the patriarchs of Aquileia which merged in 1751 with patriarchs of Venice and cut ties with the Pope, and also the reigning Doge was interned in the Castle of San Felice in Verona.

EVENTNAME326083;Cretan troubles;x
EVENTHIST326083;The Venetian occupation since 1204 of Candia was confronted with the rebellion of the Cretans, especially in the inland areas. The island was invaluable to the Republic for its products and commerce, but the inhabitants did not easily tolerate the new dominion. The Venetians were obliged to repress many revolts, and to do so more easily sent several Colonies of Nobles and Veneti citizens, to whom land was granted on condition of defending it for the Republic. In 1529 Khair ad din conquered Algiers and from there his corsairs sacked many Mediterranean towns, including Rettimo in Crete. In 1571 Cyprus fell to the Turks. These events had an influence also on the relations between the Cretans and the Venetians, the Turkish threat reduced the hostility towards the Venetian rule. In the XVIIth century the population of Crete was divided into four tiers, the Venetian noble families, the Cretan noble families, the citizens of the three main towns of Candia, La Canea and Rettimo and the rest of the population.;x

In 1560 the venetian government appointed a senator, Provveditori sopra Ospedali e Luoghi Pii, to administer the hospitals and also the ransoming of Venetian citizens held in prisons by other states.

He appointed his friends and relatives, took 3,000 Muslim soldiers into his service, and in 1535 put Achyuta in prison, proclaiming himself King. Southern nobles rebelled against Rama Raya.

EVENTNAME328004;The death of Narasa;x
EVENTHIST328004;Towards the end of his rule, Narasa had effectively carried on the dream of his King, Narasimha in protecting the empire's interests. He built a robust administration and an effective army. He had regained control over large domains in South India and kept the Bahamani Sultans and the Gajapatis at bay and brought the rebellious chiefs under control, making way for the golden era of Vijayanagar.;x

EVENTNAME328050;Fraternal Ambition;x
EVENTHIST328050;As his reign continued, Deva Raya's brothers realized they were unlikely to inherit the throne. This proved too much for his brother to bear, and he began plotting against the King. Having sent away the guards on a pretext, a messenger invited the King to accompany him to festivities. Feeling ill from dinner, the King declined. The messenger then revealed a hidden dagger and stabbed the King with it repeatedly. Meanwhile, Devaraya's brother systematically slaughtered all his other brothers and government ministers, save only one who was away from the capital. Believing him dead, the assassin was overpowered by the King and a guard and Devaraya was able to catch his brother in the act of declaring himself King. Although Deva Raya outlived his brother, the attempt on his life was ultimately successful. The King lingered on for only a few months before passing away, probably due to the complications of his wounds.;x

EVENTHIST328051;Orissa and Vijayanagar were the two great Hindu Kingdoms of their day, but they were constantly at odds with each other. Whenever one was strong, the other was weak. In between them lay the independent buffer states of the Velama and the Reddy, strong enough to take advantage of instability.

EVENTNAME328053;The Oriya Invasion;x
EVENTHIST328053;The priest-king of Orissa, Prataprudra Deva, decided to invade Vijayanagar because of the apparent weakness of its new ruler. Prataprudra's plans did not include an invasion from the north, however. When the Sultan of Bengal invaded Orissa soon afterwards, the Oriya King was forced to rush his army back north. The exhausted forces that returned were no match for Krishnadeva Raya's fresh army and the Oriya were quickly defeated. This easy victory gave Krishadeva a taste for invasion that he sated by invading Orissa twice again, taking new territories each time.;x
ACTIONNAME328053A;A tempting target;x
#;x
EVENTNAME328054;Pillar of Victory;x
EVENTHIST328054;Orissa was surrounded by enemies and although the country fought bravely, it could not always defend its conquests from invasion. In 1516 armies from Vijayanagar occupied Udayagiri and erected a pillar of victory at Simachalam. From that point on this southern region passed from the hands of the Oriya and was never again reconquered by them.;x

Given a position in government, he acted as chief minister to several Kings in succession, placing his nephew Sadasiva on the throne in 1542 as a puppet King.

EVENTNAME328057;End of the Sangama Dynasty;x
EVENTHIST328057;The city of Vijayanagar was founded in 1336 as the capital of the Hoysala Kingdom. When their line became extinct, the new Sangama dynasty took the name of the city as its own. This Vijayanagar dynasty ruled until 1486 when the charismatic provincial governor Narasimha Salwa ousted Prince Padea Rao and usurped the throne, ending 74 years of Sangama rule.;x

The Muslim armies proved superior to the Hindu ones and Deva Raya was soon in retreat. To make peace he sent 20 elephants, 200 dancing girls and a vast sum of money to the Sultan via Mohammad. The Khan was ambitious and Deva Raya secretly supported him in a rebellion against the Sultan, hoping that it would at best install a friendlier monarch and at worst divert their attention for some time.;x

EVENTHIST328062;Alarmed by the success of the Bahmanids, Deva Raya called a general council of the nobility and principal brahmins in 1442 to demand an explanation for his military failures against the smaller and poorer Bahmani Sultanate. The council eventually decided that Muslim victories were due to the stronger horses imported by the Bahmanids and the permanent force of archers maintained by the Sultan. Determined to even the odds, Deva Raya encouraged Muslims to join his army by giving them religious freedom, erecting a mosque in the capital and placing a copy of the Koran before his throne so that they could bow to the King without sinning against their faith. He also required all his soldiers to learn the bow in addition to the pike and lance, and soon had sixty thousand soldiers skilled in archery.;x

EVENTHIST19000;The German Emperor Sigismund of Luxembourg and his 2nd wife, Barbara von Cilli, founded the Order of the Dragon in 1387 as a secret military and religious organization with the aim of protecting the Catholic Church against heretics, such as the Hussites (who rose in Bohemia recently). An additional objective is the organization of Crusades against the Ottoman Turks, who had overrun most of the Balkan peninsula. On February 8, 1431, Vlad, henceforth known as Vlad Dracul, or the Dragon, was inducted in this order along with King Ladislas of Poland and Prince Lazarevic of Serbia. In addition, the Holy Roman Emperor has invested Vlad Dracul as the sovereign ruler of the Princedom of Wallachia. Dracul made good his claim by expelling Alexandru during the winter of 1436, and taking the throne.;x

Dracul was captured, bound in chains, and brought before the Sultan.

He came to the Wallachian throne with the support of the great White Knight of Christendom, the Hungarian John Hunyadi. Hunyadi had probably ordered the assassination of Dracul and his oldest son, Mircea, in response to their justifiable blame which they heaped upon the white knight for the failure of an expidition ot Varna. Regardless, Vlad's son, Dracula, had close ties of political necessity to the Hunyadis (John and his son Matthias), and developed a friendship with Stephen of Moldavia. It was with their support that Dracula claimed his father's throne and ousted his rival.;x

EVENTNAME19005;Contested Throne;x
EVENTHIST19005;In 1462, under pressure from Turkish incursions, Dracula sought the help of the throne of Hungary. Meanwhile, the Turkish sultan gave Dracula's younger brother, Radu, an army with which to support his claim to the throne. In addition, the boyars, rose up against Dracula due to his well-known cruelty and the suppression of their rights. Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary, realizing Dracula's precarious position, and wary of his volatility and devious nature, treacherously took Dracula to Hungary as a political prisoner, while Radu was left free to reign in Wallachia. Now, in 1466, Dracula has converted to catholicism and married into the Hungarian royal family. The state is divided between the cruel, yet heroic anti-Turkish Dracula, and the pro-Turkish Radu.;x

EVENTHIST329021;Descending from the Craiovesti boyars, a family who had the lead of Wallachia during the 15th and 16th centuries, Neagoe Basarab (1512-1521) singles out as a balanced, wise and learned ruling prince. Though confronted with difficulties relating to the maintenance of order within the country, and to the increase of the tribute due to the Ottoman Empire in order to maintain his country's suzerainty, he protected the development of crafts and trade.

His travels led him to Krakow, Vienna and even Paris. Here, the King Henri III used his influence at Istambul to make Petru Cercel prince of Wallachia in the detriment of Mihnea II. Petru Cercel's reign is like a (very short) breath of fresh air, his cosmopolitan court, which included Italians, French and Greeks resembled more the Renaissance courts of the West rather than the byzantine - oriental settings of old.

EVENTHIST329031;The period between Michael the Brave's death and Matei Basarab's ascension is a customary anarchical period, with again a number of colourless pretenders fighting for power (Simon and Gavril Movila, Radu Mihnea, Radu Serban, Alexandru Ilias, etc. etc.).\n \n The Ottoman Empire uses this period to reinstate its political and economical control over the principality while forcing the princes of Moldavia and Wallachia to demolish their fortfications.

EVENTNAME329032;Matei Basarab's reforms;x
EVENTHIST329032;Described by the old chronicles as a 'kind, just, wise, brave and ardent Christian' prince, Matei Basarb's reign was a period of quiet, stability and prosperity for Wallachia. He shared power with the boyars, thus putting an end to the fraticidal struggle that plagued the country for the previous thirty years. He strengthened the armed forces, and increased the size of the 'Oastea Domneasca' (the Prince's Army) to 40,000 men, one of the largest standing armies in Eastern Europe. He supported the economy, the agriculture, the crafts and the trade. The first manufactories of Wallachia producing paper and glassware were setup during his reign.;x

EVENTNAME329033;Matei Basarab's foreign policy;x
EVENTHIST329033;Matei Basarab's foreign policy was marked by alliances with Transylvanian princes Ráckózi I and II, by good relations with Poland, Venice and Rome, and by a constant opposition to the Ottomans' interference into Wallachia's internal affairs. Most Prolific Church Founder in the 17th Century in Wallachia, he thwarted the Turks' plans to sow discord between him and Vasile Lupu (who ruled Moldavia by that time, and who had tried, encouraged by the Turks, to take over Wallachia too. Likewise, Matei Basarab assisted the struggle of Serbians, Bulgarians, and other Balkanic peoples against the Turks, as he thought that Orthodox faith served by the Slavonic language could strengthen them, and be an effective means of resistance against the Ottoman oppression.;x

EVENTNAME329034;Matei Basarab's cultural work;x
EVENTHIST329034;Matei Basarab's most outstanding accomplishments are related to the vast cultural work that he embarked upon, which may be compared to that of Neagoe Basarab (1512-1521), whose political and dynastic model he followed, and to Constantin Brâncoveanu's (1688-1714), descended, like he was, from the Brâncoveni family of boyars. Matei Basarab was the greatest church founder of the Romanian people, as in his time were erected and restored over 115 churches and monasteries both in Wallachia and abroad. He even went over the Ottoman interdiction by building fortified churches and monasteries.;x

EVENTNAME329035;Udriste Nasturel;x
EVENTHIST329035;Though not a scholar himself, like his forefather Neagoe Basarab, Matei Basarab encouraged and assisted the learned men of his time. One of them was Udriste Nasturel, who fostered a Romanian humanism in the Slavonic language, which, in his opinion could express, just like the Latin, beside the values of classical antiquity, Orthodox solidarity of peoples living in South Eastern Europe. Udriste Nasturel played also an important part in the copying and printing activities of the time.;x

EVENTNAME329036;Sherban Cantacuzino and the siege of Vienna;x
EVENTHIST329036;In 1683 the Ottoman Empire once again marched its armies towards the centre of Europe, laying siege to Vienna. Alongside the Turkish forces, there were Wallachian regiments led by Prince Sherban Cantacuzino (1679-1688), descendant of the illustrious greek family. Reluctant to aid the Turks against his Christian brothers, Sherban secretly aided the Holy League who, in turn, following the crushing victories over the Ottomans, promised him the mantle of the Eastern Roman Empire to which he was entitled by descent. Sherban died in 1688, probably poisoned on the orders of the Ottoman Sultan.;x

EVENTHIST329039;Like Sherban before him, Constantin realized that the country was too weak to openly challenge the Ottoman influence.

EVENTNAME329041;Death of Constantin Brancoveanu;x
EVENTHIST329041;Because of his anti-Turkish policy of forming alliances first with Austria and then with Russia, Constantin Brancoveanu was denounced to the Porte, deposed from his throne, and brought under arrest to Constantinople where he was imprisoned in 1710 at the fortress of Yedi Kuleh (the Seven Towers). There he was tortured by the Turks, who hoped to locate the 3,000,000 fortune he had supposedly amassed. He was beheaded with his four sons on August 26, 1714.;x

EVENTNAME329042;Instauration of Phanariote rule in Wallachia;x
EVENTHIST329042;Having grown tired of the native Wallachian princes' machinations behind his back, the Ottoman Sultan decided to auction the throne of Wallachia to the Greek community of Phanar, Istambul. Thus, the period 1716 - 1821 is known in Romanian history as the 'Phanariote era'. It was a difficult period for the principality. Economically it was drained to cover the bidding expenses of the prince and to pay the tribute to the Ottoman Porte. Culturally, Greek replaced Romanian as court language and Slavonic as church-service language.;x

EVENTHIST331000;In 1515 Duke Ulrich had his marshall Hans von Hutten killed because he had an affair with Hutten's wife. This upset whole Southern Germany. When in 1519 he seized the imperial city of Reutlingen, the strong internal and foreign opposition that had built up against him stepped in and forced him to leave Wirtemberg.

EVENTHIST331020;Because of Duke Ulrich's multiple wars and the indeminities he had to pay to the Emperor for fighting him several times, the new Duke Christoph inherited a large debt from his father. Following the example of the Treaty of Tübingen, he decided to cooperate with the burghers represented in Wirtemberg's estates, the Landschaft. Between 1551 and 1554 terms for financial aid were negotiated, and eventually the Duchy's budget was consolidated and the debt decreased.

EVENTHIST331021;Christoph was a visionary Duke and the most productive legislator and reformer in Wirtemberg's history. Soon after his ascension, he ordered a code of law for Wirtemberg, the Landrecht, that he introduced in 1555.

Ludwig was very keen on a good representation and reputation, and he wanted to show his greatness to posterity. Ordered by him, his court architect Georg Beer, one of the most notable German renaissance builders, constructed the Neue Lusthaus, an expensive palace, the Landschaftshaus, a new residence for the estates, the Collegium Illustre, an elite academy, and several churches.

In January he summoned the Landschaft and proposed a complete revision of the Treaty of Tübingen that had introduced the estates' participation in political power and a new constitution assigning much more power to the Duke. This was rejected, which caused Friedrich to dissolve the Landschaft. Already in March he made a second, more moderate attempt to change Wirtemberg's constitution in favour of central authority.

EVENTHIST331029;On November 23rd 1731 Friedrich Ludwig, the only legitimate son of Duke Eberhard Ludwig and heir to the throne of Wirtemberg, died. Since Eberhard Ludwig was already 55 and his wife 51 years old, it was evident that they would have no more offspring. Therefore, Carl Alexander of Wirtemberg-Winnental, a side branch of the ducal dynasty, was successor to the throne. Carl Alexander had served successfully in the Imperial army during the Turk Wars and the War of Spanish Successionand became a close confidant of Prince Eugene and the Emperor. They convinced him to ceremonially convert to catholicism in the court chapel of Vienna in 1712. When Eberhard Ludwig died in 1733 and Carl Alexander was to succeed to Wirtemberg, the estates, afraid that catholicism would be imposed on them and their privileges reduced, forced him to accept the Religions-Reversalien, a guarantee to maintain protestantism as the Duchy's main religion.;x

EVENTNAME331030;Joseph Süß-Oppenheimer's economic policies;x
EVENTHIST331030;Duke Carl Alexander of Wirtemberg was heavily influenced by his financial adviser Joseph Süß-Oppenheimer, a Jewish merchant from Frankfurt. Süß-Oppenheimer wanted to conduct radical economic reforms according to mercantilist principles and following the example of France, thus modernising the economy andcreating a solid base for absolutistic rule.Despite the resistanceof Wirtemberg's estates and of the nobility he was determined to enact these mercantilist policies and had the full support of the Duke. He established monopolies for leather, wine, tobacco and salt, taking he free trade in salt which had been guaranteed to communities for centuries under state control, and extended the already existing one on manufacturing. At his order, several porcelain and silk factories were built and the first bank in southern Germany founded. These measures were initially quite successful. Süß-Oppenheimer thereby managed to greatly increase the Duke's wealth, to expand his authority and introduce effective control of Wirtemberg's economy. However, he was bitterly opposed by the wealthy classes who feared for the estates' and their own privileges, were generally against a strong central authority and had a certain hostility towards Oppenheimer because he was a Jew and considered a parvenu.;x

The Landstände who had suspected Carl Alexander and Oppenheimer of intending to suppress its influence and thewealthy classes who had felt threatened by his economic policies now wanted to see Oppenheimer dead. Since he considered itthe only way to cope with the unrest and distract the tensions from the ducal dynasty, the regent Carl Rudolf let Oppenheimer's enemies put up a trial against him in which he was accused of high treason, fraud, defalcation and adultery. From the beginning it was an unfair process: he was denied information on the reproaches, his assigned counsel did nothing for him,the judges were appointed by the estates, his pleading remained unread and he was not even allowed to attend to his trials.Eventually he was, also in absence, condemned to death and strangled at the marketplace of Stuttgart where his dead body was exhibited for 6 years.;x

EVENTNAME331032;Hohe Karlsschule;x
EVENTHIST331032;In 1767 members of the Wirtemberg army informed Duke Carl Eugen about the horribly bad educational background of his officers and advised him to create an academy for young officers. This idea was realised in 1770. Carl Eugen commissioned Christoph Dionysius Seeger with the establishment of a school for children of soldiers at the ducal castle Solitude. On December 16th 1770 the academy was officially founded as a gardener school, however from the beginning it was to educate officers just as well as gardeners. The classes and the tuition followed strict military principles: drill, permanent supervision and wearing uniforms were forced upon the students. Nevertheless, it soon became a quite famous and highly esteemed institution, emphasizing not only military training, but trying to give the future officers a wide, versatileknowledge. They learned French, Latin, Greek, Italian and High German, were taught artillery theory, engineering, strategy, law and philosophy and additionally got specific professional educations, e.g. forestry, medicine, economy or arts that were supposed to prepare them for their functions as officers, clerks or Ducal artists. Due to this outstanding quality, not only students from Wirtemberg, but from the whole of Germany and from abroad were interested in the school. In order to be able to accomodate them, the academy was moved to Stuttgart and made a residential school. In the next years, it quickly developed from a purely military academy into a more general institution, visited by several famous politicians, scientists, officers and artists, most notably Friedrich Schiller whose work was deeply influenced by his time at the Karlsschule. Acknowledging this, it was transformed to a university called 'Carls Hohe Schule' on February 11th 1782.;x

EVENTHIST331033;The example of Louis XIV's Absolutism in France influenced almost all of Europe, and many princes, even those with diminutive factual power, were eager to copy him, both in his authority and in his extravagancy. Eberhard Ludwig of Wirtemberg was one of these princes. Despite fighting him in the War of Spanish Succession, he was a great admirer of Louis and his French state, and he attempted to rule in a similar way. In Wirtemberg however, the Estates had a strong influence and extensive privileges since the 16th century, and they were eager to keep this position. Eberhard Ludwig summoned them only once during his reign and thereby simply ignored Wirtemberg's constitution, substantially strengthening his position, but also causing dissent against his rule.;x

EVENTNAME331034;The Commissioning of Ludwigsburg;x
EVENTHIST331034;Eberhard Ludwig of Wirtemberg was keen on copying not only Louis XIV's absolutist rule, but also his castle Versailles since he, like Louis, wanted to demonstrate his greatness and power by constructing a splendid castle. Following Louis' example, he chose a little, insignificant village, Ludwigsburg, close to his capital, Stuttgart, as site for his project. In 1704 the builders Johann Friedrich Nette and Donato Giuseppe Frisoni were recruited for the construction of a castle similar to Versailles. Initially, Nette planed a palace comprising three wings, connected by narrow galleries, around a representative court. Frisoni expanded it by two more side buildings and a magnificent baroque castle church. While thecastle was built, the former village Ludwigsburg was transformed into a representative residential town, also with Nette and Frisoni in charge. Eberhard Ludwig officially moved his residence to Ludwigsburg in 1718.;x

EVENTNAME331036;Despotism and extravagance;x
EVENTHIST331036;During the long reign of Karl Eugen despotism and extravagance reached their peak in Wirtemberg. Huge amounts of money were spent for his personal amusement: new castles, excessive feasts and several travels. His ministers financed this by extortion, sale of offices, loans, monopolies, lotteries and French subsidies. During his whole reign, dissensions with his subjects arose that he sought to suppress by tyrannic measures. Critics like the writers Schubarth and Schiller were either imprisoned or banned. Nonetheless, his rule also had good aspects: he further enhanced ducal control of the economy, supported the establishment of a porcelain manufactory in Ludwigsburg and created a standing army that was involved in the Seven Years War.;x

EVENTNAME331038;Influence of Franziska von Hohenheim;x
EVENTHIST331038;In the last years of his reign, Karl Eugen became more of a benevolent monarch than the tyrant he had been before. This change was probably due to the influence of his mistress Franziska von Hohenheim that he got to know and fell in love with in 1771. She used her position to get the Duke to care about his subjects and improve their situation. Instead of wasting his money for his pleasure, the Duke started to provide funds for viticulture, education and the construction of roads and generally was more dedicated to the administration of his countries. In a manifest proclaimed in the country's churches on his 50th birthday in 1778, the Duke openly regretted his mistakes and declared his desire for a reversal and recommencement. Corrupt ministers were replaced, some imprisoned dissidents released and former unfair decisions annuled. Therefore Franziska was very popular among the populace despite her illegitimate liaison with the Duke. After the death of Karl Eugen's first wife, Friederike Elisabeth Sofie, he was able to marry Franziska and did so in 1785.;x

EVENTNAME331039;The deputation of the Empire;x
EVENTHIST331039;By the Treaty of Lunéville of 1801 the empire formally ceded everything left of the Rhine to Napoleonic France, with the princes who thereby lost territory demanding a compensation and the empire disintegrating, it was evident that the empire would need to be drastically reformed. Negotiations began in 1802, and victorious France soon tried to influence them, in order to strengthen the medium powers like Bavaria, Württemberg, Baden and Hessen to be counterweights against Austria and Prussia. On February 25th an agreement was reached. The two most important decisions were the Mediatisation of all free cities except for Bremen, Hamburg, Lübeck, Frankfurt, Augsburg and Nürnberg and of most small independent principalities andthe Secularisation of almost all church possessions in the empire. The big countries in Southern Germany that France wantedto ally with, Bavaria, Wirtemberg and Baden, massively increased their territories. By receiving the possessions of the abbeys of Ellwangen and Weingarten, several small former church territories and the Imperial cities of Weil, Reutlingen, Eßlingen, Rottweil, Aalen, Gieningen, Hall, Gmünd and Heilbronn, Wirtemberg got in total 850 sqm of new land with 124000 inhabitants.;x

EVENTNAME331040;The Kingdom of Württemberg;x
EVENTHIST331040;When war between Napoléon and Austria started again in 1805, Friedrich of Wirtemberg first intended to stay neutral. However, faced with the impressive French army invading Southern Germany and realising that this would be the only way to prevent his country from being overrun, he accepted Napoléons proposal of an alliance. Because of that alliance he was one of the German princes who profited most from the peace with Austria signed in Pressburg. He was ceded most of the Habsburg possessions in Swabia and, since the empire was dissolved, achieved unlimited sovereignty in his territories. Thushe was able to declare himself King on January 1st 1806. After his coronation, Friedrich began to reform his country after the example of France. The administration was centralized, a system of ressort ministeries created, the country divided into several districts, the law adjusted to the Code Napoléon and serfdom largely abolished. Württemberg, as the Kingdom was called, had developed into a modern state, and this was not changed by the eventual defeat of Napoléon.;x

EVENTNAME331041;The Constitution of 1819;x
EVENTHIST331041;Since the last years of Friedrich I's reign, the introduction of a constitution in Württemberg had been contemplated by the King and his ministers and demanded by both democrats and the conservative old estates in Wirtemberg. There was however a conflict about how influence would be distributed. The sketch of a new constitution making few concessions and vesting most of the power in the Duke presented to representatives of the estates and the country was rejected shortly before Friedrich's death in 1816, and it was upon his successor Wilhelm to find a compromise. Finally on September 25th 1819, a constitution was enacted by the King. Therein, a bi-camerial parliament, the upper chamber(Standesherrenkammer) composed of representatives of the King, the nobility and the old estates, the lower (Abgeordnetenhaus)elected by census vote, was created and granted some influence (e.g. it had to consent to the appointment of ministers and to the King's budget), while most of the power remained with the King. Although these parliaments were dominated by the bourgeoisie and the nobility, the constitution can be considered the beginning of representative democracy in Württemberg.;x

EVENTHIST331701;Against resistance from inside and outside, we have managed to get the reforms needed to turn Germany from a powerless feudalistic entity held together loosely by the Imperial crown into a modern national Kingdom by another Reichstag at Augsburg. Most of Germany has been reorganized into Imperial circles that are firmly under the authority of the Imperial Chamber Court and other new institutions and have to supply the Emperor with taxes and troops. Only the territories of the Electors and the Habsburg Archdukes are still excluded from these reforms due to the regal powers they have been granted by the Golden Bull and the Privilegum Maius.

EVENTNAME335000;Drought;x
EVENTHIST335000;Like other Bantu people the Shona of Zimbabwe counted wealth in cattle, not gold. For centuries the Shona had led their cattle up to the plateau in summer when the mosquitos swarmed, then led them down in winter to graze. But as Great Zimbabwe grew, its herds of cattle increased significantly, leading to shortages of grazing land that became critical in times of drought. Because the King of Zimbabwe was also its spiritual leader he was blamed when Mwari did not bring rain, setting off a political crisis as well.;x

EVENTNAME335001;Breakaway Settlements;x
EVENTHIST335001;Great Zimbabwe was its own worst enemy. As the state grew, new settlements appeared and Zimbabwean culture spread. After more than a century, these new settlements were so far away from Great Zimbabwe that they were more or less autonomous, and some took advantage of this to break away from Zimbabwe. Most of these settlements were small, but some were more powerful. Great Zimbabwe itself was the largest city in southeastern Africa, with over 18,000 people at its height. Such a large city required huge amounts of food, food that was sent to the capital from surrounding settlments. With each loss, less and less tribute reached its way to Great Zimbabwe to feed the people.;x

EVENTNAME335002;The Torwa;x
EVENTHIST335002;As Zimbabwe grew it outstripped its own reach. Various groups broke away from Great Zimbabwe to found their own competiting cities. One of the biggest of these was the Torwa, who migrated west to the Khami river around 1450. There they founded a city with more decorative art and more advanced drainage than Zimbabwe. Although their city was splendid, it was no longer a part of Great Zimbabwe.;x

EVENTNAME335003;Zimbabwe's Decline;x
EVENTHIST335003;Great Zimbabwe itself was the largest city in southeastern Africa, with over 18,000 people at its height. Such a large city required huge amounts of food, food that was sent to the capital from surrounding settlments. One after another, settlements along the fringes of the state began to break away, many of them to the northern Mwenemutapa Empire, that had itself broken away from Zimbabwe around 1400. As Mwenemutapa gained control of the valuable Swahili trade, trading goods from afar became scarcer and dearer. Gold, which was used mainly to buy overseas goods to appease the nobility, was now almost worthless. Sensing the end, people began to desert the city of Great Zimbabwe.;x

EVENTNAME335004;The Mwenemutapa Empire;x
EVENTHIST335004;Around 1400 the Karanga people broke off from Zimbabwe to found a trading city near the Zambezi river. Their leader was given the title Mwene Mutapa, 'one who explores', and this became the name of the state as it began to absorb other Zimbabwean settlements. Over the next century Mwenemutapa grew until it controlled the northern half of the Zimbabwean Plateau and had gained control over the valuable Swahili trade. Around this time the Portuguese were attempting to take control of the Swahili coast and they settled along the Zambezi, trading with the Mwenemutapa and ignoring Great Zimbabwe. As Zimbabwe itself had done to the Mapungubwe, so now the Mwenemutapa were doing to them. The Mwenemutapa continued to grow, gradually becoming the dominant power in the region. The Portuguese were disappointed with the gold they found, however, and turned their attentions to the Americas instead.;x

The Paramount Chief of Monomotapa, Gatse Lucere, requested aid from the Portuguese settlements down river from Chincanda to suppress the revolt. While initially successful in quelling the revolt, Gatse Lucere was over-zealous in protecting his own position and prompted continued revolts by various Karanga chieftancies for most of his reign.;x

EVENTNAME90900;The Byzantine Renaissance Begins;x
EVENTHIST90900;Having weathered the Ottoman storm, the Byzantines slowly began to win back ground. They eventually succeeded in retaking the Aegean seaboard, restoring the Empire to the small but stable condition it was in during the days of Michael VIII Paleologus in the mid-13th century. Finally having some breathing room, the Emperors were able to take stock of their situation and make much needed reforms.;x
ACTIONNAME90900A;Begin the Renaissance;x
#;x
EVENTNAME90901;The Restoration of Hagia Sophia;x
EVENTHIST90901;Hagia Sophia, the Church of Holy Wisdom, was built by the Emperor Justinian I in the mid-6th century and stood as the largest and most impressive church built until it was used as the inspiration for St. Peter's Basilica during the Renaissance. However, the last millenium had not been good to it and the Emperors were more often than not too poor to maintain it properly. However, the newly prosperous nobles, private citizens, and Orthodox Church have pledged donations. Now the time has come to make use of the cultural revival of the 14th century and the Byzantine resurgence of the 15th century and restore the Hagia Sophia.;x
ACTIONNAME90901A;Restore Hagia Sophia to its former glory;x
ACTIONNAME90901B;No need for relics of the past;x
#;x
EVENTNAME90902;The Byzantine Land Purchase;x
EVENTHIST90902;A reinvigorated Byzantium has been spreading out of its base in the Aegean, first into the Eastern Mediterranean, now into the Black Sea. Now they want to buy our Black Sea provinces!;x
ACTIONNAME90902A;We cannot hold on to them, they are too far away;x
ACTIONNAME90902B;We shall die before giving up our land!;x
#;x
EVENTNAME90903;The Themata;x
EVENTHIST90903;To counter the expense of defending a threatened empire in the 7th century, Emperor Constans II replaced the traditional Roman provinces with a new system of themes, whose leaders (strategos) held both civil and military power. Soldiers were enrolled in each theme and given a grant of land from which to maintain themselves in addition to a stipend. The grants were large enough for infantry to support themselves and their families, while cavalry and sailors could afford to hire tenant farmers to work the land. Besides their annual spring training and occasional offensives, they were always on call for defensive duties. Unlike mercenaries, the system presumed they would fight very fiercely to protect their land. It worked very well, increasing the size and effectiveness of the military, raising the prosperity of the countryside by creating a class of small freeholding farmers, and reducing government expenses.;x
ACTIONNAME90903A;Reestablish the themes!;x
ACTIONNAME90903B;No need to dangerously empower the peons;x
#;x
EVENTNAME90904;Revolt of the themata;x
EVENTHIST90904;The strength of the themata system was that they provided a large, cheap, effective military. It was however also a problem, as more than one Emperor found out at the wrong end of a sword. A large army that could appear next to capital on short notice is especially devastating when they are also the ones supposed to put down revolts.;x
ACTIONNAME90904A;The themata are revolting!;x
#;x
EVENTNAME90905;The Tagmata;x
EVENTHIST90905;Rattled by the danger posed by rebellious themata, Constantine V created the Tagmata, or Regiments. Each tagma was a small, elite armed force that drew income from land in a theme like ordinary soldiers, but was permanently on duty in the Emperor's service. They were heavily geared towards offensive operations, making them a strong core for foreign expeditions. At the same time the themata were also broken into smaller units to reduce the size of potential revolts.;x
ACTIONNAME90905A;Create the tagmata;x
ACTIONNAME90905B;No more armies in the capital!;x
#;x
EVENTNAME90906;Rise of the Magnates;x
EVENTHIST90906;The system of small freeholding farmers was always open to exploitation by the rich and even a typical officer's position in the army could bring nice profits from taxing tenants. Consequently families began amassing large holdings of land in Anatolia and Thrace, which they then used to buy out soldiers with small plots. These families put their own interests ahead of that of the Empire or the peasantry, but had a strong following and were an effective military force.;x
ACTIONNAME90906A;Let us leave our friends, the magnates, in peace;x
ACTIONNAME90906B;These magnates will be trouble one day! Break up their holdings;x
#;x
EVENTNAME90907;The Great Shipyard;x
EVENTHIST90907;The next step in Byzantium's naval expansion was to rebuild its great military and commercial fleet. Gone were the days when the ports of Constantinople along the Golden Harbor were without peer so the call went out to the Italian city-states for shipwrights. Many answered, but they did not come cheap and their home cities were unhappy to see them depart.;x
ACTIONNAME90907A;Let's become the ruler of the Mediterranean!;x
ACTIONNAME90907B;It's a waste of our resources;x
#;x
EVENTNAME90908;The Genoan Land Purchase;x
EVENTHIST90908;A reinvigorated Byzantium has been spreading out of its base in the Aegean, first into the Eastern Mediterranean, now into the Black Sea. But no Black Sea trading empire can be complete without Genoa's colonies in the north, guarding the Sea of Azov. Perhaps this is a matter where the purse shall prove mightier than the sword...;x
ACTIONNAME90908A;1000 ducats is a fair price;x
ACTIONNAME90908B;Ha, what shall we do with that worthless land?;x
#;x
EVENTNAME90909;Economic Reforms of the Byzantine Revival;x
EVENTHIST90909;A key factor in the Byzantine revival was changing the course of the economy, which had suffered greatly in the previous 400 years. One problem was that magnates had established serfs on large, semi-autonomous estates. A different problem was that Venice, Genoa, and Pisa had wrested the lucrative Aegean and Black Sea trade out of the hands of Byzantine merchants. Clearly, many changes were needed, and those changes were going to be very painful.;x
ACTIONNAME90909A;Reclaim our trade;x
ACTIONNAME90909B;Reform the estates;x
ACTIONNAME90909C;Reform the estates and reclaim trade;x
ACTIONNAME90909D;It's too hard to reform right now;x
#;x
EVENTNAME90910;The Reclamation of Anatolia;x
EVENTHIST90910;It took the Turks only a few centuries to permanently alter the composition of Asia Minor. Yet now the revitalized Empire had reconquered all of Anatolia, and the questio was what needed to be done regarding the native population of the reconquered regions. They were a hodgepodge of Turk and old Greek, with the latter having become like the former over the course of several centuries. Should reforms be undertaken?;x
ACTIONNAME90910A;Yes, let us look at each province in turn;x
ACTIONNAME90910B;Things are fine as they are;x
#;x
EVENTNAME90923;The Turks in Sivas;x
EVENTHIST90923;As time went on, pressure grew for the Court in Constantinople to take decisive action in the province, which remained largely Turkish. The Court was however inclined to do nothing at all even though that would hurt the long term growth of the region. The next most popular option, inspired by the Iberian Kingdoms was to simply expel the Turks at great cost to the province. While the bureaucrats liked such a simple solution, the military thought it would be better to resettle the area with true Byzantines drawn from the excess population of Thrace and Constantinople over the course of many decades. Finally, a minority of intellectuals wondered why the Turks couldn't simply be accepted as valued subjects of the Emperor, but to do that would require reconciling the Turks in each province in Anatolia.;x
ACTIONNAME90923A;As long as the taxes come in, who cares who's doing the paying?;x
ACTIONNAME90923B;Expel the foreign infidels!;x
ACTIONNAME90923C;Resettle Constantinopolitans in the province;x

EVENTNAME90939;The Great Naval Reform;x
EVENTHIST90939;As Byzantium expanded its territory, it was once again obligated to turn its attention to the sea. Though Byzantine merchants had once dominated Mediterranean trade from their island bases throughout the Sea, Venetians, Genoans, and other Italians had long since wrested control of trade from them. Should Byzantium attempt to reclaim its rightful naval and commercial position at the risk of offending the rich Italian city-states?;x

ACTIONNAME90942A;Accept them as Sunnis;x
#;x
EVENTNAME90943;The Assimilation of the Turks;x
EVENTHIST90943;A remarkable policy of reconciliation was followed with all the Turks in the Empire. With the old Ottoman Empire gone they were prepared to become loyal subjects of the Emperor. While the future might eventually see a strong marriage of Byzantine and Turkish strengths, at the time there was a strong reaction against 'the Turkish surrender'.;x
ACTIONNAME90943A;The nobles question the Emperor's policy;x
#;x

ACTIONNAME90945A;If they don't accept payment in gold, they will pay us in blood.;x
#;x
EVENTNAME90946;The Sibling Conflict;x
EVENTHIST90946;When an Emperor died his eldest son usually was the successor but the case of Konstantin XIII was different. He was a dimwit that would probably prove to be a disaster on the throne. His only real competitor was his elder sister Zoe, who was considered to be among the sharpest minds at court. However, for all her qualities she was a woman and an Empress on the throne would not be seen favourably by the old guard. Konstantin on the other hand would probably be in the hands of powerful noble families. Fortunately, Zoe had the support of her husband general Alexandros Makrienos.;x
ACTIONNAME90946A;Konstantin is the rightful heir!;x
ACTIONNAME90946B;The Empire needs qualified leadership, long live the Empress!;x
#;x
EVENTNAME90947;Removal of a threat;x
EVENTHIST90947;Although invested with the throne, Zoe knew that as long as her brother was alive he would remain a threat to her power.;x

#;x
EVENTNAME90948;Nobility revolts in favor of Konstantin;x

ACTIONNAME90948B;Bribe them off;x
#;x
EVENTNAME90949;The nobility revolts;x

EVENTNAME90951;The Great Noble Revolts;x
EVENTHIST90951;Although the revolts against the Empress's rule had failed, the nobility tried one more time and poured all their resources into it.;x
ACTIONNAME90951A;Crush the revolters!;x
#;x
EVENTNAME90952;Dealing with the nobility;x
EVENTHIST90952;After major revolts, Zoe had had enough and the nobility was reigned in with vengeance. With the nobility sufficiently cowed, reconciling with them provided the opportuning for substantial long term benefits.;x
ACTIONNAME90952A;Slaughter them all and confiscate their lands!;x
ACTIONNAME90952B;Hold their families hostage;x
ACTIONNAME90952C;Take a more forgiving attitude;x
#;x
EVENTNAME90953;Reformation of the army;x
EVENTHIST90953;After the major revolts in the early years of Zoe's reign, the Byzantine armies were in a sorry shape and major reforms were needed.;x

ACTIONNAME90953B;Offense is the best defense;x
ACTIONNAME90953C;Balanced reforms;x

#;x
EVENTNAME90954;Reformation of the economy;x

ACTIONNAME90954B;Expand trade;x
ACTIONNAME90954C;Internal tax reform;x
#;x
EVENTNAME90955;The universal reform;x
EVENTHIST90955;Centuries of warfare had led the Empire, once renowned for it's art and learning, to become a second class society in those regards. Zoe was always a patron of the arts and wished for Byzantium to become the light of the world it had once been. However, if that road was to be followed, it would take a monumental effort and the choice would be an unpopular one among the people.;x
ACTIONNAME90955A;The past should be valued;x

ACTIONNAME90956B;Continue on the way forward;x
#;x
EVENTNAME90957;Dealing with the merchants;x
EVENTHIST90957;Having to bear a large part of the Empress' efforts to reform, the merchants grew unruly. Although merchants didn't control armies, they did control the finances of the government and its subjects, especially the banking system. Upsetting them could prove very dangerous.;x

EVENTNAME90958;Power struggle;x
EVENTHIST90958;After the death of Michael X, his son Ioannes assumed the throne. However, he was extremely unpopular among the nobility due to his views and intents on cutting the power of the nobles and centralizing the Empire to a larger degree. His brother Nikolai on the other hand was considered by many nobles an ideal candidate, as he professed an aggressive policy towards the Empire's neighbors. A power struggle ensued, with Nikolai emerging victorious.;x

EVENTNAME3000001;Nasrid domination;x
EVENTHIST3000001;In the Nasrid's reign, Al-Andalus was at a state of chaos. The only cities under the control of the Muslims were Granada, Malaga and Almeria, last refuges of the Moors. With a tattered army, a continuously bickering nobility, and the increasing power of their northern Christian neighbors, the future of Granada was bleak. The Christians demanded the complete surrender of Granada. The small Emirate tried to buy time from the Christians and unite the nobility, but it was costly and ultimately proved futile.;x

EVENTNAME3000002;Military reforms;x
EVENTHIST3000002;The fortifications built by the Nasrid dynasty were impressive and had proved their effectiveness in repelling the Christians many times over. The Aquiddafar castles, located on Jabal Al-Haya (Mountain of Life), were able to route the Christians in the battle of Wadi Odya in 1342. The Nasrid dynasty was reluctant in constructing any more of these great behemoths in fear of a Christian backlash.;x

EVENTNAME3000003;The conquest of Tullaytillah and Cordoba;x
EVENTHIST3000003;In 1085, the city of Toledo was captured, and in 1236 Cordoba fell to the same fate from the northern Christian rulers. These were once great cities of Islam, but under the Christian rule much of what was once great was destroyed. Cordoba was once one of the holiest cities in the world and the seat to the Caliphate of the Ummayeds. The city was the birth place of Averros and Miamonides, men of great knowledge. Cordoba once boasted more than seventy libraries, five bazaars, street lighting and over five-hundred-thousand tenets. Never again would it rise to such prominence. However it still remained an important city to Muslims in the west, mostly of Berber descent. Many still clung to dreams of the day when they could once again bring it to light, but others looked to the future and the new seat of power in Granada.;x

EVENTNAME3000004;Revival of Andalusia;x
EVENTHIST3000004;Having defeated the Christians, and uniting the remnants of Muslims in the southern tip of Iberia, Granada was successful in regaining some of ground lost during the Iberian Christian reconqusita. Having restored the southern Moorish cities to at least a somewhat stable state in the time of the Bani Kiram and the southern Taifas of the 12th century, the Emirs were able to unite the Muslim efforts and make direly needed reforms.;x

EVENTNAME3000005;The Moors are arising;x
EVENTHIST3000005;The infidels in southern Iberia refused to submit to Christian rule. They have managed to regroup and take back most of the south. As their power grew, they threatened all of the Christian Iberians. In order to thwart this, the remaining Iberian successor states attempted to put aside their differences in the face of this new threat.;x
ACTIONNAME3000005;Let's stop them!;x

EVENTNAME3000010;The Moors control Tago;x
EVENTHIST3000010;With Granadian power on the rise, the southern lands were no longer safe for Christians.

EVENTHIST3000011;In response to the growing power of Granada, Castile summoned the Iberian nations to a meeting in Léon. The purpose of the meeting was to settle final borders across the Iberian peninsula, and ensure the survival of Christian Iberia. Here Castile offered to forfeit their claims on the Kingdom of Castile and loyalty to Granada in exchange for safe passage for all Christian Iberians to Castile and a stop for further Granadian expansion in Iberia.;x

EVENTHIST3000016;The resurgence of Granada in the west against the Iberian Christians and the cultural, spiritual, economic and military superiority in the region has not gone unnoticed in the Muslim world. Many other Islamic nations would have that power and those in the East do not condone a Moorish Iberia. Like many other powerful Sunni nations before it, Granada claimed the title of Khalifah in order to help grant more legitimacy to itself against the other forces that might threaten it because of its mostly Berber ethnicities which were often treated as second-class citizens in other Muslim nations. This did not go over well in other major Islamic powers in the region.;x
ACTIONNAME3000016A;We need the title of Khalifah to protect our people;x

EVENTNAME3000018;Treaty of Cordoba;x
EVENTHIST3000018;With Muslim power on the rise in the south, the Christians had moved on to exploration and exploitation of the New World. It had become costly to continue the wars with Granada. Granada was finding itself more and more alienated from the eastern Islamic world for fear of a new western Caliphate being set up. So a treaty was beneficial for both sides. The Iberians would grudgingly recognize Granada's right to exist as an Islamic Iberian state while Granada would end its northern expansion.;x
ACTIONNAME3000018A;Accept the Treaty;x
ACTIONNAME3000018B;Reject the Treaty;x
#;x
EVENTHIST3000019;With the signing of the treaty, Spain recognized Granada's existence as a southern Iberian Islamic state so that it could better concentrate on the more profitable exploration and exploitation of the New World. This still had some hard-core fanatics who were quite upset at this development.;x

EVENTHIST3000026;With the Aztec Empire firmly under the control of Granada time had come to decide the fate of the once proud culture.
