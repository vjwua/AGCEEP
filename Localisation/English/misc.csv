GOODSDESC_COFFEE;Coffee was first grown in Ethiopia, but started as a cultivated crop in the Arabian peninsula, and from there spread to the Ottoman Empire. Largely through the efforts of the British and Dutch East India companies, coffee became available in Europe in the 16th century. The first coffee plantation in the New World was established in Martinique, in 1723, and this country, like most others cultivating coffee as a commercial commodity, relied heavily on slave labour from Africa for its viability;x
GOODS_GOLD;Bullion & Gems;x
GOODSDESC_GOLD;Gold and silver were the basis of all formal currencies in Europe. A significant quantity of the gold was mined, especially in Bohemia and Hungary. The great gold mines of Central and South America would nearly multiply the currency supply tenfold leading to vast enrichment of some nations but also multiplying currency debasement and inflation. Precious stones were acquired almost exclusively from long-distance trade with the East: rubies were brought from India and Ceylon, sapphires from Ceylon, Arabia, and Persia, emeralds from Egypt, turquoises from Persia and Tibet, and diamonds from India and Central Africa. Europe also produced a variety of gems and semi-precious stones. Besides precious stones, also a great variety of less valuable stones were frequently used.;x
GOODSDMD_GOLD;The value of Bullion and gems is not affected by supply and demand. However the more Bullion and gems that are produced globally the more will all nations suffer from 即inflation劬. Bullion and gems producing nations suffer even more from inflation.;x
_EYRSYMBOL_GOLD_ROLLOVER_;Bullion & Gems;x
GW_I_INFLATION;Bullion and gems are not affected by supply and demand, so the incomes we get from Bullion and gems producing provinces are always the same. The actual income we get from a Bullion and gems producing province is only affected by our Infrastructure and the size of the city or colony in the province.;x
GW_D_INFLATION;However the greater percentage of our total yearly incomes that are derived from Bullion and gems the more will our Inflation grow. Inflation increases the prices for all our investments and actions and is very difficult to get rid of.;x
