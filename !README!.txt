WELCOME TO THE AGCEEP
Bundled version with "For the Glory"
AGCEEP Website: www.agceep.org

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We are trying to make the best mod we can focusing on History, alternative history and gameplay... not necessarily in that order.

Options:

Once you start the AGCEEP you can then select a scenario. We have the 1419, 1520 and 1648 scenarios, as well as special fantasy Byzantium and Granada scenarios with a particular focus on those countries.

Once you select a scenario you will then be presented with more options than the standard EU2/FtG game.

Use Random events:
  If clicked NO, this option will disable the use of the AGCEEP Random events.

Alternative Events:
  If clicked YES, then certain Fantasy events will be enabled that will allow the formation of the imperial kingdoms of Germany and Italy, an Independent Wales, a Unified Iberia, and a new crusade by the Order of St. John and England.

A huge thanks to all former HC members from yesteryear, without whom this project would never have survived for so long, and to MichaelM for his continued support for FtG!
