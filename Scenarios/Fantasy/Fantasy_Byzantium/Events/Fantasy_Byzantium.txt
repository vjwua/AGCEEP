Soldiers were enrolled in each theme and given a grant of land from which to maintain themselves in addition to a stipend. The grants were large enough for infantry to support themselves and their families, while cavalry and sailors could afford to hire tenant farmers to work the land. Besides their annual spring training and occasional offensives, they were always on call for defensive duties. Unlike mercenaries, the system presumed they would fight very fiercely to protect their land. It worked very well, increasing the size and effectiveness of the military, raising the prosperity of the countryside by creating a class of small freeholding farmers, and reducing government expenses.
