The only cities under Muslim control were Granada, Malaga and Almeria - the last bastion of the Moors in Iberia. With a tattered army, a continuously bickering nobility, and the increasing power of their northern Christian neighbors, the future of Granada was bleak. By now united against the lingering Muslim threat, the Christians demanded the complete surrender of Granada. The small Emirate tried to buy time from the Christians and unite the remaining Moorish nobility, but it was a costly and ultimately futile ambition.

As a result, the Treaty of Córdoba was proposed: beneficial to both sides, the Iberians would grudgingly recognize Granada's right to exist as an independent Islamic realm, whilst Granada would agree to end its northern expansion against the Christians.
