#AGCEEP Religions - Specific information for countries

#NOTE: currently we use vanilla 1.3 religions.txt and global_flags.txt as fallbacks
#this means lollard and jewish are unused but ready to implement
#atlantean and norse are available for fantasy scenarios/options if desired (e.g. Vinland)
#when adding/editing religions please use 1.3 naming schemes and make sure icons/localisation are named accordingly

#religious_leader = { }  List of countries that give CB during war to countries in the same religous subgroup against country at war against the leader (for example, Papacy for Catholic faith).
#no_dynastic = { }       List of countries that cannot be elected HRE or have dynastic relations with other countries (even if allowed by religion). The 'no_dynastic = yes/no' trigger can be used for events specifying tags in this list.
