#Goods

#Goods must be uniquely named ("nothing" is reserved and may NOT be used).

#base_price = X          Base price in $ (default is 1 if not specified).
#min_demand = X.XX       Demand is never lower than this (default is 0.01 if not specified).
#max_demand = X.XX       Demand is never higher than this (default is 1.50 if not specified).
#land_support = yes/no   If yes, increases land support limit (default is no if not specified).
#naval_support = yes/no  If yes, increases naval support limit (default is no if not specified).
#slaves_demand = X       Specific goods for slaves demand calculations (default is 0 if not specified).
#slaves = X.XX           If positive, each slaves_demand province increases slaves demand according to slaves value and under condition (default is 0.00 if not specified).
#inflation = yes/no      If yes, increases inflation and mine value in province is used instead of supply-demand and base_price (default is no if not specified).
#<building_name> = X.XX  Type of building or manufactory that gives a demand boost.
#demand = { }            List of goods that get demand boost of the specified amount for each defined goods producing province (different from slaves_demand).
#manufactory             Type for default manufactory and related income increase above normal value for manufactories if yes (default is weapons manufactory with no increase if not specified).
