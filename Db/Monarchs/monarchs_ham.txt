In the spring of AD 1482 he led a surprise night attack on Ha Mi and regained control of the lost territories. However, he was still not appointed king by China. In AD 1488, after Aheima succeeded Ali to become Sultan of Turfan, he arranged a royal marriage with Han Shen and killed him in the plot. Yalan was sent to occupied the land again."

China appointed him king but Shanba governed his people badly. A commander Amulang raided Turfan, which led to a third invasion of Ha Mi in AD 1493. Ha Mi and Shanba were captured. The constant wars led to refugees fleeing to neighbouring areas. The Ming government felt that there is no benefit in allowing the return of Shanba, and responded by closing its borders to all western barbarians. The pressure of China sending some troops close to its area, as well as other tribes blaming Turfan for the inability to pay tribute and trade with China caused Turfan to finally hand back Ha Mi and Shanba in AD 1497. China slowly rebuilt Ha Mi."

Later, a son of Turfan's Sultan Aheima, Zhen Tiemur, was invited to govern Ha Mi. Zhen Tiemur's mother was Han Shen's daughter, so he was related to Yankebola. After Sultan Aheima's death, son Mansur suceeded as Sultan and fought with his younger brothers. Fearing his older brother Mansur, Zhen Tiemur took refuge in Ha Mi. Then Shanba died and was suceeded by his son Baiya. Baiya was a cruel and unintelligent leader. Zhen Tiemur went back to Turfan and disclosed the affairs of Ha Mi to Sultan Mansur. This allowed Mansur to persuade Baiya to defect to Turfan. Turfan forces then occupied Turfan, and conflict with China continued until AD 1529, when China finally dropped Ha Mi as an issue."
