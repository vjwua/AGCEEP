PLEASE HELP OUT WITH THINGS HERE:

...or tell us if something is obsolete and should be removed from the list.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Things to do list:

- add additional/re-add previously removed tags in line with the fact there are no longer tag limits
- similarly, re-add additional 'native' cultures from 1.3 vanilla
- update religions in line with vanilla (e.g. lollard)
- further discussion on the merits of a 14th century scenario (e.g. 1357)
- further discussion on additional alt. history starting options (e.g. Zheng He discovers America)
- progress towards an 18th century scenario (1718 was the original agreed date)
- finish updating AGCEEP website with recent changes and additions
- tidy up the Americas and ocean borders in provinces.txt (geography mapmode)
- update rebels.txt with new regional rebel and pirate types

Major issues that need resolving:
- Setup and events for Butung are all messed up.
- Gotland needs a monarch file, and its event file is broken/unfinished.
