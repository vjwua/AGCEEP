He sent a letter to the VOC's Governor of Taiwan in August 1655. The Spanish, wrote Chenggong, had been mistreating his sailors, and he had therefore issued an edict that forbade Chinese to sail to Manila on pain of death. He enclosed a copy of the edict and requested that the Governor propagate it in Formosa and enforce it by confiscating the junks and property of any who disobeyed. But the language of the edict raised the hackles of the VOC. First, it said that the Dutch ''behave more like animals than Christians.'' Second, it referred to Chinese who lived in the Dutch colony as Chenggong's subjects. Third, and most important, it threatened punishment not only for Chinese but also for ''anyone outside of our nation who extends money for trade with Manila.'' If company officials did as Chenggong asked and published the edict, they would be admitting that Chenggong had sovereignty over the Chinese colonists in Formosa. The Governor and the council decided they must refuse Chenggong's request to preserve ''the sovereignty of the Netherlanders.'' They replied with a ''compliment letter,'' which politely declined his request.
