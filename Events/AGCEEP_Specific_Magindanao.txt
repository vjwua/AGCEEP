The Spaniards responded with new attacks on Sulu and Magindanao.A peace treaty was finally signed in 1609.

	#-#In response to a diplomatic incident in 1627, the Raja of Sulu attacked Camarines Sur and the Central Visayas. The Spaniards invaded Sulu in response. Sulu and Magindanao allied and jointly invaded the Central Visayas in 1634. War waged until 1644, when the Spaniards opted for abandoning Sulu and signed another peace. However Sulu and Magindanao had been weakened. By then Spain had gotten hold of a large part of Magindanao, and strong immigration by Christian Filipinos was changing the demography of the island. Sulu would continue the wars and rebellions into the North American conquest of the Philippines, but Magindanao came under Spanish control except for the occasional rebellion.
