	#-#Carlos III the noble, considered a frivolous wasteful monarch, was however a skillful diplomat. Conscious that Navarre, surrounded by powerful neighbors, could not longer win battles, he maintained good relationships with Castile, Aragon, France and England. Internally, he pacified the capital by granting the Privilege of Union in 1423. Up until then, the capital was not a city but three, the Bourgh of Navarraria, originated over the Roman Pompaelus, the Bourgh of Saint Cernin, populated by urban Franks, and the Bourgh of Saint Nicholas, populated by rural Franks, those two originated from pilgrimage through the road of Santiago. With the Privilege of the Union, all the differences were erased, and over 200 years of wars and confrontations ended. However, Carlos III expenses, that made the court of Navarre more sumptuous that those of Paris and London, almost bankrupted the country.

	#-#Within Carlos III policies, Aragon was to have a special place. When his daughter Blanca, heir to the Kingdom, widowed from Martin the Young, heir to Aragon, she was remarried in 1419 to Juan, the second son of the new King of Aragon, the Castilian Fernando de Antequera. When Carlos III died, Blanca became the Queen. Juan, the consort, expent all his time fighting against his Castilian relative Juan II, and his constable Don Alvaro de Luna in defense of his Castilian possessions. Blanca and Juan had three children, Carlos, the older, received the heir title of Prince of Viana, Blanca was married to Prince Enrique of Castile creating a great scandal, as the marriage was never consumated, and she was returned intact a few years later, and Leonor, the younger, was married to Gaston IV, Count of Foix. In 1441, Queen Blanca I of Navarre died. According to the law of the Kingdom, the crown belonged to Carlos, but in her testament Blanca stipulated that Carlos should not take the crown without the consent of his father. It was clearly a courtesy to her husband. But Juan, necesitated of the Navarran resources to continue his fights against Luna, refused to relinquish the crown, although he left the government in the hands of Carlos. This decision caused a great upheaval in Navarre, whose nobility was already split in two powerful clans, the mountaneers shephardic Beaumont, and the riverside agricultural Gramont, ready to offer their support to the King or the Prince in exchange for increasing their power and weakening their rivals.

	#-#As the Castilian nobles started to defect his side in his wars against Juan II of Castile and Alvaro de Luna, Juan I of Navarre needed more help. So he decided in 1444 to marry Juana Enriquez, the daughter of Fadrique Enriquez, Admiral of Castile, a title not related to the sea, but second in rank to the King, and also a bitter rival of Luna. But the strategy did not pay off. On the military front he suffered a crushing defeat at Olmedo in 1445, losing all his possessions in Castile, while his brother Enrique was killed. In Navarre his second marriage was badly received, and removed any remaining legitimacy to the crown that he could have. At the same time he completely allienated his son Carlos, who finally decided to take his crown from his father's head when he gained the support of the Castilians of Luna, and the Beaumonts, while obviously the Gramonts rushed in support of his father. The country suffered enormously from this confrontation, as incursions, crop burning and cattle slaughtering were the preferred methods of fighting. Finally, at the battle of Aybar in 1452, Carlos was decisively defeated and imprisonned for two years. In 1455 Juan stripped Carlos and Blanca of their rights to the crown, and named Leonor, his youngest daughter married to Gaston IV of Foix, governor and heir of Navarre on the condition of using his armies to conquer the Beaumont strongholds. After his release, Carlos travelled to Sicily, seeking the help of his uncle, the King of Aragon, Alfonso V. To show that the divisions continued, in 1457 the parliaments at Estella declared Leonor and Gaston heirs to the Kingdom, while the parliaments at Pamplona confirmed Carlos as rightful King.

	#-#With the death of Alfonso V of Aragon, his brother Juan I of Navarre becomes Juan II of Aragon. But Alfonso has left the Kingdom of Aragon in total disarray with his Italian adventures. The economical crisis of the County of Barcelona has the society split in two, the urban patrician nobility or Biga, the high nobility and the church in one side, and the artisans, merchants and burgheoises, or Busca, in the other side, with the peasants, or payeses of Remensa, opposed to their oppressing rural nobility. The nobility opposes the King, while the citizens and peasants try to extract from him rights and more power in exchange for their support. It is a poisoned gift for somebody like Juan, used to get what he wants by force. At the same time Carlos becomes the heir to Aragon, a situation that displeases Queen Juana, who already has a gifted son with Juan of name Fernando. The Beaumonts, supporters of Carlos, claim for a union with Aragon, the Gramonts defend the independence with Leonor and Gaston. Juan suspects Carlos might be joining the Castilians again, and inprisons him, and the civil war explodes again in both Navarre and Aragon. Juan is forced to release Carlos, but sick of tuberculosis, he dies in September 1461, leaving his sister Blanca as heir to his claim to the throne of Navarre. Juan has to fight the Castilians and Beaumonts, while he has the help of the Gramonts, Gaston of Foix and Louis XI of France. Blanca is an obstacle to the claim of Leonor and Gaston, but Juan will deliver her to Gaston who will inprison her in Moncada until her dead in 1464. When Enrique IV abandons his claim to the crown of Aragon offered by the rebel party in Barcelona, the Castilians leave the war, and the Beaumonts are defeated. Looks like peace, but it is only a respite.

His sister Madeleine of France is married to Gaston, son of Leonor and Gaston IV of Foix. Navarre is steering towards France once more after a century of Iberian influence. Once Louis has obtained the Rousillon from desperate Juan, he shifts his support to the rebels in Barcelona, that have offered the County to Renee of Anjou, Count of Provence. With the help of Louis, Leonor and Gaston, who have shown themselves as quite incompetent in ruling Navarre, decide to seize the chance and take the crown from old, blind, Juan, since it looks like he is going to live forever, or at least outlast them. The orphaned Beaumonts are more than happy to have someone to follow in hope of recovering their lost properties. Juan will once more disinherit one of his rebel children, naming Leonor's son, Gaston, heir to Navarre. But Gaston will die in a tournament in 1470, leaving two young children, Francois Febus and Catherine with his widow Madeleine de France. Juan has no choice but to reinstate Leonor as heir to Navarre. The war between Beaumont and Gramont however continued.

Isabel and Fernando are designing the union of Spain, and strongly prefer a dynastic union with Navarre. For the first time, Juan seems to trust one of his children. The Castilian protectorate will last thirty years, and although it will not end the war between the Beaumonts and Gramonts, it will greatly abate it.

He is 11 years old, but since 1472 he is also the Count of Foix. His mother Madeleine of France, sister of Louis XI, acts as the Regent. However the wars between Beaumonts and Gramonts reignite, and for two years Francois Febus cannot be crowned, finally he will be crowned in Pamplona in December 1481. However he died in January 1483. According to legend he was given a poisoned flute to play. 1483 was therefore a momentous year for Navarre. The crown had to go to Catherine, who was 15 years old, while her mother Madeleine of France acted as Regent. But his uncle Jean of Foix, Viscount of Narbonne, claimed the crown for himself. His brother Gaston was never King of Navarre, and therefore, as son of Leonor he had a better claim to the crown than Catherine according to Salic law. Jean, brother-in-law of Louis XII of France, had the support of the French Kings. Castile, as protector of Navarre, offered the hand of Juan, son of the Catholic Kings, to Catherine. This solution had the support of both Beaumonts and Gramonts. But Madeleine wanted a different solution, and against the decision of the Navarran parliaments, married her daughter to Jean III Albret in January 1484. Jean Albret was the owner of very extensive lands in the South of France. He was not only quite incompetent, but his French possessions were more important to him than his smaller Navarran Kingdom. The judicial and military war between Jean of Foix-Narbonne and Catherine and Jean of Albret will prevent the crowning of Catherine and Jean as Kings of Navarre until 1494. The dynastic fights between the Foix on top of the continuous civil war will cause the final demise of the small Kingdom.

The Castilian protectorate had kept Louis from declaring war to Catherine and Jean Albret, but after the death of Isabel, Fernando married Germaine of Foix, Gaston's sister. Worried about this strenghthening of their rival claim, Catherine and Jean signed a treaty with Felipe I Habsburg, consort King of Castile in 1506, but they are betting on the wrong horse. Felipe dies, and Castile falls into a troubled regency by Cardinal Cisneros. A Beaumont sublevation in 1507 is defeated, and Navarre considers herself free of the Castilian protectorate and breaks the many treaties of dynastic union, the last one between Henry of Navarre and Isabel of Castile in 1504. The hands of Louis are now free, and he declares war to Jean Albret and Catherina in their French possessions, as he knows that an invansion of Navarre will provoke a Spanish reaction. However, at the league of Cambrai treaty in 1508, Maximilian of Austria, father of Felipe, and granfather of the heir, Carlos, will obtain from Louis the compromise of not attacking Navarre for one year. The days of Navarre are counted. She has been weakened by a still unresolved civil war, dynastic fights and is conducting a very poor diplomacy. The only question is if it will become a part of France or Spain.

At the battle of Ravenna, the Spanish troops of Fernando killed his brother-in-law and French general, Gaston of Foix, nephew of Louis. Fernando, married to his sister Germaine of Foix, suddenly inherited the claim that Louis had been using in his attempts at incorporating Navarre to France. The English and Spanish were preparing an invasion of France through the Pyrenees and Fernando requested guarantees for the neutrality of Navarre. In a final diplomatic blunder, Jean and Catherine refused and entered into a defensive alliance with France at the treaty of Blois of 1512. Fernando invaded Navarre with the support of the Beaumonts, defeating the French and the Gramonts. The English troops under command of Dorset, left disgusted of being used, leaving the Basque flank exposed, but the Basques defended San Sebastian from the French, and the Duke of Alba successfully held Pamplona. Finally the French had to withdraw with great loss. Fernando obtained a legitimation for keeping Navarre when the Pope excommunicated the Kings of Navarre for their alliance with the schismatic Louis. The Beaumonts and the population, that was tired of the civil war, swore allegiance to the new King in exchange for the recognition of their former privileges, and the Parliaments crowned him as King of Navarre in 1513. Fernando, then Regent of Castille in the name of his daughter Juana the Mad, decided to incorporate the Kingdom of Navarre to the Kingdom of Castile instead of to his own Kingdom of Aragon. Jean Albret would try to recover his Kingdom in 1516 after the death of Fernando, and the French would try to conquer Navarre in 1520, taking advantage of the Comuneros rebellion in Castile, but they failed to raise significant support and were defeated by the Spanish armies.
