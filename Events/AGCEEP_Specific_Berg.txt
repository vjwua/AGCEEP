The estates elected Arnold, the Count of Egmont as new Duke, defying the claims of Adolf of Berg who was recognized as successor to Jülich by Emperor Sigismund in 1423 and to Guelders in 1425. In turn, Arnold of Egmont claimed the inheritance of Jülich as well. A succession war followed in which the cities and nobles of Guelders supported Arnold. It ended in Arnold retaining Guelders and Zutphen, and Gerard, the son of Adolf, being acknowledged as Duke of Jülich. Although Berg failed to conquer Guelders, its power increased significantly by the acquisition of the wealthy Duchy of Jülich.
