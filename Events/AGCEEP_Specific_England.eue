Whilst Henry lived, the appointment was acceptable to all because Gloucester was firmly under the Royal Power of his eldest brother and could be called to order if the necessity arose. He was an intelligent man, and in the last months of King Henry V's reign, Gloucester discharged his office dutifully and conscientiously. He was one of the most prominent of the heroes of Agincourt and had been severely wounded in that epic battle, which ensured his immense popularity with the common people. Added to this he was affable, approachable, and a noted patron of letters and learning. He favoured the continuation of the war until the French were truly subjugated, a view commonly held by the people who felt that they deserved nothing less. Gloucester's troubles arose from his dealings with the magnates whose responsibilities enabled them to play a hand in England's government. They found him quarrelsome and difficult and so they disliked and distrusted him. Chief among those who held this view were the two remaining Beaufort brothers, Henry, Bishop of Winchester, and Thomas, Duke of Exeter, the infant King's guardian. Henry V had done what he could before his death to arrange for his son's rule. By his will Henry's brother John, Duke of Bedford was to control France and fight the war, and England was to be ruled by Gloucester. However, there was no constitutional precedent, and while Gloucester viewed his brother's dying wishes as his right, in actuality, it was the Lords of the Council who would determine Gloucester's place in government. Led by Henry Beaufort, the Council resisted Gloucester's wishes, and refused to invest a Regency in him. Instead, Gloucester was created 'Protector of the Realm of England', which gave him the positon as King's Chief Councillor, sinking however to the role of Second Councillor whenever his older brother John was present in England. So the council secured their rule despite Henry V's wishes and Gloucester's actions. Nevertheless, Parliament could reverse the development, and was to meet late in the year. Gloucester then pressed his cause before the Lords to be recognised as Regent of England, basing his claim on his blood relationship to the new King, and the dying wishes of his brother. The Lords, suitably prepared by the two Beaufort brothers and other members of the Council, flatly refused Gloucester's request. Thus parliament backed the Council's wishes and his reduced position was confirmed. Gloucester was deeply insulted by Beaufort's efforts, and would never truly forgive him. Meanwhile the nominal rule of a baby invited discord and frustrated the war effort. Sacrifice and unity were demanded at home, yet they depended heavily on the success of the war...

	#-#William, Count of Holland and Hainault died in 1417, leaving one daughter, Jacqueline. Jacqueline had been married to the late Dauphin of France, who had died only a few weeks before her father. At the time, King Henry V had made overtures for the lady's hand for his brother John, Duke of Bedford, but her mother, the sister of the late Duke of Burgundy, John 'the Fearless', saw to it that the young widow married John, Duke of Brabant. John was Philip's nephew and his father had been killed by the English at Agincourt. The marriage may well have been void on the grounds of consanguinity, because John and Jacqueline were cousins, but its political justification lay in keeping Hainault within Burgundy's control. John 'the Fearless', and his son and successor, Philip 'the Good', had understood this all too well. Jacqueline had been passed over for the succession to the counties on her father's death in 1417 in favor of her uncle, John of Bavaria. However, the Duke of Brabant had simply ceded much of Jacqueline's inheritance to the Duke of Bavaria in order to settle the dispute. A diplomatic move that had not been received well by Jacqueline. Furious over her dull husband's inability to secure the inheritance, Jacqueline had left him. In 1421, she fled to London, where she met Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester. Within two years, they announced their intention of getting married. The two needed a Papal dispensation for the marriage, which Pope Martin V would not supply. Thus, Gloucester approached the recently displaced Pope Benedict XIII, who was happy to spite Pope Martin by granting the annulment. Their marriage entitled Gloucester to the counties of Holland, Zeeland and Hainult, albeit at a cost. The Courts of Europe were scandalised by what they had done. Philip was incandescent with rage and made it clear that he had suffered a grave affront which he felt most deeply. Believing, with good reason, that Jacqueline's inheritance of Hainault would never be surrendered to her peacefully, Gloucester saw seizure by force as the only alternative. The Council was finding it difficult to keep Gloucester in order, and it may well be that his enterprise was aimed at defying the wishes of the Council which had spurned him under the leadership of Bishop Beaufort. Nevertheless, they warned him that any such a venture into Hainault would be seen as a hostile act against Burgundy herself.

Beaufort, bishop of Winchester, had been offered a Cardinal's hat during Henry V's reign, though the King had refused to allow Beaufort to accept, requiring the Bishop's services during those critical years. He was in high favour during Henry V's and Henry IV's reigns, serving as Chancellor on more than one occasion. Gloucester remained a staunch supporter of the war in France, but more importantly, had harboured ill feelings towards his uncle for excluding him from assuming control of King Henry VI's Regency after Henry V's death. Although Beaufort held a majority of support among the councillors in England, Gloucester's popularity in the Commons tended to balance the two court parties. In several instanes, the two had come to bitter words, heated exchanges and blows. On this occasion, however, Beaufort felt his life was in danger. Gloucester had already incited several mobs protesting Beaufort's actions, and was now threatening to forecfully remove Beaufort himself. The bishop frantically wrote to the Duke of Bedford, begging him to return to the Council in order to straighten out the valiant Duke's irate younger brother. Thus Bedford was obliged to return to England, in order to soothe the two parties. He remained there, personally administrating England until the two parties had been somewhat reconsiled the situation had stabilized, temporarily abandoning his personal war efforts in France.

Within weeks of Bedford's departure, areas of English occupied France revolted in a desperate attempt to shake off the English, whose presence in France had begun to seem like occupation. Compounding England's problems were severe grain shortages accross much of France. The English were forced to respond to the shortages by banning the export of grain in order to secure enough food for the soldiers. Bedford's death also signaled the gradual but steady demise of the King's Council and domestic stability, as constant jockeying for Royal favour within the factionalized English Court eclipsed issues of great importance and necessity. Without his older brother Bedford to keep him somewhat pacified, Gloucester, now heir presumptive, unleashed himself on Cardinal Beaufort. Their rivalry and continued squabling represented a source of constant conflict that spilled over into foreign and domestic matters. The events of the autumn of 1435 prompted the boy King, Henry VI, now nearing fourteen years of age, to voice his own views and take a greater interest in the emotionally charged political circumstances of the day. One thing was certain, England was simply ill equipped for, and slow to adapt to Bedford's departure.

	#-#The Duke of York was the son of Richard Earl of Cambridge and Anne Mortimer who had perished within days of York's birth. Richard had inherited his title from his paternal grandfather Edmund of Langely, the fourth surviving son of the great Edward III. Cambridge had been executed for treason by King Henry V on the eve of Henry's initial expedition to France in 1415, leaving York an orphan at the age of four. York's paternal uncle Edward, then Duke of York, was killed at Agincourt shortly thereafter, leading the English vanguard against the French cavalry in the opening phases of that epic battle. Perhaps it was Edward's loyalty and courageous actions at Agincourt that saved his nephew from an early political demise, but certainly by enfeofing his estates to trusted lords and supporters, Edward had helped to secure his young nephew's eventual recovery of the lands of York. Through his mother Anne, York would eventually inherit the vast Mortimer estates. Moreover, Anne descended directly from Lionel of Antwerp, the second surviving son of Edward III. Thus, York had an excellent claim on the throne of England, an arguably better claim than Henry's and the wealth to back such a claim if need be, as York was the richest and greatest magnate in England. Despite the questionable actions of his ancestors and his quiet claim, he had served as Henry VI's constable and had further proved himself a loyal subject of Henry's. In the months following Bedford's death, Gloucester's Court faction grew increasingly critical of Cardinal Beaufort's dominance over Henry VI. In the meantime, greater problems had emerged in France. The Council eventually decided York was the best candidate for Bedford's replacement. However, the length of York's term was indefinate, as the King would come of age soon enough and would be expected to make his own appointments. York was charged with the difficult task of providing good governance to lands wrought with strife and seathing with unrest. In this task he was largely successful, surrounded as he was by experienced administrators such as Louis of Luxemburg and seasoned soldiers like Lord Talbot...

	#-#Frustrated with a lack of proper funding and the constant sense of bickering and deadlock within the King's Council, Richard, Duke of York had requested he be relieved of duty in France late in the Spring of 1437. York had been replaced with Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, a brilliant military commander though already an aged man. It could hardly have been unexpected when, less than two years later, Warwick passed away. His successor had to be sensitive to the conflicting political views held by Gloucester and Cardinal Beaufort's faction in the King's Council. Furthermore, the new lieutenant needed to be of sufficient social status, and of the modest number of possible candidates York was the most promising. The Duke of Gloucester was anxious to secure the post, but the Beauforts and their aspiring affinity successfully resisted his efforts. York had experience, landed resources from which to raise fresh troops, and had shown himself willing to listen to advice. Thus he was once more driven into England's entanglements in France, and named Lieutenant-General of France. The terms of his appointment were similar to his predecessors. He was given the authority to make personal appointments to all offices, including those of constable and chancellor, and to all benefices in France. He could dispose of all lands which might come to the Crown either for life or in tail male, and reserved the right to appoint captains to castles where absentee custodians had failed to make provision. He was granted control over French revenues. During his first term, York had been quick to earn the loyalty and respect of many of Bedford's former supporters in France, and used this appointment to consolidate his power. During his five year term he would manage to stabilize the countryside, despite the decision to reduce the French presence in his large council from a majority to a minority of just two. The mood was such that the French could no longer be trusted. Order would have to be restored from the top down. On the other hand, the move was symptomatic of a pressing issue...the English presence in France was not being viewed as one of liberation or rightful rulership, but of brutal occupation. There were, however, alterior motives behind the appointment as members of the Cardinal's Court faction spread inflated fears that Gloucester and York had allied against the King. With York in France, Gloucester could be isolated and neutralized, and events could soon transpire to tip the balance of Royal sway further in the Beauforts' favour.

	#-#The trial of Eleanor Cobham, Humphrey Duke of Gloucester's wife, was primarily the result of Henry VI's suspicion and fear of his uncle. Gloucester, though aged, was an overbearing presence at Court, and as the heir apparent, his opinions could scarcely have been ignored by either the King or his Councillors. Yet through his constant attacks on the Cardinal Beaufort and his nephews, Gloucester had shown himself to be a political enemy of those whom Henry, more often than not, was looking to for support of his aims. To the Beaufort family, the thought of Gloucester succeeding Henry VI was not an alluring one. By 1441, it had been resolved that Gloucester must be eliminated or at the very least curtailed. Thus it came to be that Eleanor Cobham was accused of sorcery. Astrology was practised by many to forecast what the future may hold, but it was still looked upon with mixed feelings, and any practice of the art had to be very discreet. Roger Bolingbloke, a priest who had some connection with Gloucester and Eleanor, was arrested together with other priests on the grounds that they had cast Eleanor's horoscope to forecast whether she would ever become Queen of England. Whether or not this was ever done is not clear. Bolingbloke subsequently found himself placed on a stage, clad in a fantastic garb and surrounded with the tools of his alleged craft. The Bishops of London, Salisbury and Rochester gave a blistering sermon bidding him to turn his back on all sorts of sorcery. Eleanor promptly fled into sanctuary at Westminster Abbey, which was viewed to signify a guilty conscience. The Abbey gave no sanctuary where sorcery was concerned, and she was subsequently brought before an Ecclesiastical Court. The Church had already used torture to extract the evidence it wanted against her from Bolingbloke and the other priests. Eleanor now found herself facing multiple charges, among them treason, heresy and witchcraft, and was committed to confinement to await further examination. The Beauforts now felt it wise to involve others, particularly the temporal Lords. King Henry VI could be prevailed upon to issue a commission charging several prominent members of the Council to examine the matter further. Accordingly John Holland, Earl of Huntingdon, Humphrey Stafford, Earl of Stafford, William de La Pole, Earl of Suffolk, Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland, Ralph, Lord Cromwell, John, Lord Fanhope and Robert, Lord Hungerford were charged with the investigative task...

	#-#The commission established by Henry VI uncovered a woman known as 'the Witch of Eye'. She had been accused of witchcraft before, but had been released for lack of evidence. She now sold cosmetics, and Eleanor was one of her customers. Eleanor soon found herself with further charges, one of which was that she was an accessory to the treasons alleged against the priest Bolingbloke. Eleanor was further examined by the Bishops of London, Lincoln and Norwich. The examination resulted in further charges alleging an attempt to bring about Henry VI's death by magic. She was said to have made a waxen doll of the King, and to have stuck pins into it designed to produce excruciating pains in the same part of the King's person. She was then supposed to have placed the doll before a hot fire. Its slow melting would have caused the King to die slowly, in excruciating agony. Eleanor, who was prepared to admit that she had bought cosmetics from the Witch, vehemently denied all the other charges against her. The Bishops' task was made no easier by the fact that the King was undoubtedly still alive and in the best of health. Neverthless, the Bishops could rely on the confessions of her co-accused which had been extracted through torture. She was found guilty of all the charges alleged against her and had every expectation of joining the Witch and Bolingbloke at the stake. Despite the grim fate of her accomplices, Henry VI forbade the taking of Eleanor's life. She had served ther purpose, as Gloucester's wife was now associated with witchcraft, a heinous offence. Eleanor was forced to perform a public penance. It was enough that she was to be confined for the rest of her life, first in Chester castle and later in Kenilworth. Henry VI saw to it that she had an ample allowance so that she could live in some degree of comfort. Gloucester was not what he'd once been. He had regarded himself as untouchable, standing as he did so close to the Throne. Now it had been made very clear, and very apparent, that his enemies had found a way to harm him in a manner which he could not easily have foreseen or forestalled. In place of the old recklessness, he now had to be extremely careful, and this was not something that came easily to his nature. The Beauforts had seen to it that he was crushed as a political force. Gloucester was still as popular as ever with the populace, but at Court, men began to drift away from him as the Beauforts were clearly ascendant at Court. King Henry VI may have been pliable, and he still had a great deal of regard for his old uncle. However, if Gloucester filled the King's ear with tales discreditable to the Beauforts, it was only necessary to remind the King that Gloucester's consort had been condemned for sorcery.

	#-#York had received a summons to Parliament. His presence was necessitated by Henry VI's determination for a lasting peace with France. Henry's determination to press ahead with his policy placed York in considerable political difficulty. The policy was unpopular and was actively resisted in France and to some extent in Henry's Council as well. York's own council in France was uncooperative, and his councillors in England were highly critical. While York had been in France, Adam Moleyns, keeper of the Privy Seal and a staunch ally of Edmund Beafourt Marquess of Somerset, had accused York of corruption and general mismanagement to the detriment of England's positions in France. Not long before this York had received the backing of Parliament and public recognition for his services. Nevertheless, charges of mismanagement were obviously unwelcome from any source, and it was especially disconcerting that they had been pressed by a royal councillor so close to Somerset, Suffolk, and the King. Adding to this was York's hostility towards the conciliatory measures Henry was prepared to make in order to secure his peace with France. Thus, when York sought due payment from the exchequer for his services, he found his inquiries deflected. Despite York's understanding that his summons to England was merely a temporary engagement, Henry refused to reappoint him to the command in France. York's inquiries were brushed off with casual assurances that he had not incurred any Royal displeasure. In reality, Henry and his closest councillors, particularly the Beauforts, had begun to view York with as much distrust and suspicion as they did Gloucester. Subsequently, York, the greatest and mightiest of England's nobles was to be patronized, isolated, and circumscribed. It was the beginning of a series of preemptive measures taken to eliminate a potential source of obstruction to Henry's Royal prerogative.

	#-#York had received a summons to Parliament. His presence was necessitated by Henry VI's determination for a lasting peace with France. Henry's determination to press ahead placed York in considerable political difficulty. The policy was unpopular in France and was actively resisted in France and to some extent in Henry's Council. York's own council in France was uncooperative, and his councillors in England were highly critical. In the meantime, Adam Moleyns, keeper of the privy seal, had accused York of favouritism in the payment of some soldiers, non-payment of others, and general mismanagement to the detriment of England's possessions in France. York would retort with charges of his own against Moleyns. Despite the public recognition York had received for his services in an act of Parliament, charges of mismanagement were obviously unwelcome from any source, and it was especially disconcerting that they had been pressed by a royal councillor so close to Suffolk and therefore, to the King. When York sought due payment from the exchequer for his services he found his inquiries deflected, and within the year, his position was given to Edmund Beaufort Earl of Somerset. Given recent Beaufort enterprises into France, the appointment could scarcely generate much confidence within York's council in France. Many assumed that Somerset had been appointed to further a peace policy. Compounding York's problem was the fact that he had taken part in council discussions in England regarding the prospect of surrendering certain English holdings in France, to which he had demonstrated an outright hostility. York was not prepared to support any such conciliatory concession to France. He was equally as unimpressed with several favourable financial settlements confirmed by Henry upon the Beauforts, especially when York's own financial capabilities were being stifled by the lack of payments owed to him. Alternatively, Henry VI could have rewarded York with the Duchy of Normandy. York was after all, England's premier Duke, and he had sacrificed much for Henry's realm. Moreover, slighting York may not be the most wisest of actions in the long run. Of course any act alienating prized Crown possessions of England to those outside of the King's closest advisors would have be met with resistance from Beaufort's and Suffolk's affinity. But then again, these men coveted such lucrative positions for themselves...

They regarded Gloucester, still heir presumptive to the Throne, as an enemy because he opposed their regime. Suffolk and his adjuvents could count on Queen Margaret, who regarded Suffolk and the Beauforts as supporters, and shared their dislike and distrust for Gloucester. Queen Margaret had little difficulty in persuading the King that Gloucester should be impeached, and Suffolk prepared Articles of Impeachment for Parliament to consider. Writs were issued bidding Parliament to meet at Cambridge for the primary purpose of considering the Articles of Impeachment. It was clear to Suffolk, however, that Gloucester's demise was necessary. A rumour quickly circulated that Gloucester was about to rise in revolt. In this respect, Gloucester played into his enemies hands by raising a small retinue of horsemen. On his way to Parliament, he was arrested without warning. However, Gloucester's immense popularity with the Commons, and Henry's knack for forgiving his subjects, gave Gloucester a good chance of simply enduring a light reprimand. Suffolk understood this all-too well...Gloucester died in confinement within days of his arrest. Meanwhile, Parliament had been moved to an region where Suffolk's supporters were most prominent. And so a Parliament packed with members from Suffolk's own estates had Gloucester attainted. Gloucester's heirs were executed and his lineage was no more. It was impossible to quell the rumours about Gloucester's death, and many assumed Suffolk orchestrated the whole debacle.

	#-#Henry II had been the first English King to invade Ireland. The resulting Treaty of Windsor had established Henry II as Overlord of the island. Subsequently, a small but steady influx of English 'conquerors' carved out an area of land along Ireland's shoreline which would would later be called 'the Pale'. King John I was granted the Lordship when he was a boy, beginning a traditition that continued for centuries. Although John invaded Ireland and improved the administration and infrustructure of his English possessions, there was little he could do about the assimilation of English settlers into Irish culture. Moreover, his reforms had aggravated both the Irish and the Anglo-Irish. The scenario was not helped during Edward I's reign, as his warmongering had drained the Irish purse. Subsequently, during Edward II's reign, the Crown was forced to cancel the withdrawal of Irish funds for English expediture. Furthermore, the Scottish King Robert I's brother, Edward, invaded Ireland and proceeded to pillage the English lands there. Roger Mortimer, a wealthy English magnate with lands in the Welsh marches, was sent to Ireland as Edward II's response. Mortimer reconquered the English lands on the island, crushing Edward Bruce in the battle at Faughart in Ulster. Mortimer took Edward's lands and created Earldom of Ulster. By this time, however, Ireland was bankrupt and facing widespread famine. The various Irish Lordships possessed by English nobles were held by men who lived in England, and who rarely, if ever, visited their estates in Ireland. Attempts were made in 1297 and 1388 to coerce these absentee landlords into moving to Ireland permanently, through penalty and fine for those who would not. However, this merely served to convince many to sell their estates to Irish Kings, resulting in a further deterioration of English authority in Ireland. During Edward III's reign, his son, Lionel of Antwerp, Duke of Clarence invaded Ireland, but the sheer minority of English settlers all but rendered his efforts useless. Clarence recognized that the assimilation of English migrants into the Irish culture was undermining the Crown's authority, and so he issued the infamous Statutes of Kilkenny. The Statute was designed to segregate Englishmen from Irishmen with respect to law, language and custom. In practice, the Statutes were uninforcible and so they were widely ignored. The King's Justiciar remained largely powerless once the Royals left for England. The pattern of invasion and retreat repeated itself as Richard II and Henry IV both subscribed to a traditionally limited role in Ireland.

By this time, public hostility and opposition to Henry's regime was high and there were several uprisings which had to be put down. In a subsequent Parliament, the Commons adopted the procedure of impeachment and used it against Henry's corrupt Chief Councillor William de la Pole, Duke of Suffolk, challenging the whole policy of the King's government. Henry himself openly favoured the accused, who made an emotional appeal to his King. Despite the Commons' desire for indictment and due process of impeachment and with rioting and unrest plaguing Suffolk's trial, Henry interfered and sentenced his minister to a temporary exile, without any formal verdict of guilt or innocence. In so doing, Henry had flagrantly excercised the royal prerogative in defiance of the Parliamentary proceedings and the justice the realm sought. Nevertheless, the harsh punishment Parliament had failed to obtain was to be provided by the commonality. Suffolk, on his way to exile, was beheaded by an Irishman with six strokes of a rusty sword. Although Suffolk was dead, the Commons would not forget Henry's attempt to save him, no more than they would retreat from the battle for Resumption. The King, far from submitting, resisted the Parliament's efforts until it was eventually agreed that Henry would reserve the right to exempt those whom he alone felt deserved such status. The Acts of Resumption were to be applicable to all of Henry's grants from the moment he assumed the throne on his father's death. Needless to say, many of Henry's Lancastrian supporters would find themsleves quite content. Some would even manage to gain from the act.

Disputes over several large and lucrative inheritances had fractured many of England's nobles into two factions that, if left unchecked, could embroil the realm with civil unrest and perhaps even civil war. As sovereign, Henry had final jurisdiction over whose lands would be resumed and whose would be spared. However, Henry had always been a weak King and so he fell easy prey to the ambitions and machinations of those in his own Court. Thus, Henry favoured his Lancastrian supporters and essentially punished their rival Yorkist faction.

	#-#Adam Moleyns, keeper of the Privy Seal, was murdered early in the by soldiers awaiting transportation to France. He had attacked York's credibility not so long before, and Cuthbert Colville, an esquire in York's service in Normandy, had been party to the deed. In a seperate incident, William Aiscough, Bishop of Salisbury, was torn to pieces by his own parishioners. He'd been dragged from the church, where he had been saying Mass, to the top of a nearby hill and savagely slaughtered. It was widely held that both were covetous men, much hated by the common people, and were said to have promoted Gloucester's death. With these acts of mob violence in the backdrop, a formidable pro-Yorkist movement of Kentishmen revolted against Henry VI's government. The rebels were led by Jack Cade, a former soldier who claimed to be of Mortimer descent. The significance of the claim was twofold. First, Richard II had named Mortimer heir presumptive before his deposition and subsequent murder at the beheast of the Lancastrian usurper, Henry Bolingbloke, Henry VI's grandfather. Moreover, in accordance with England's laws of succession, Mortimer had been the legitimate heir. Second, the Duke of York was a descendent and the sole surviving heir to both the vast Mortimer Marcher lands in Wales, as well as their claim to the throne through Richard II's uncle, Lionel, Duke of Clarence. The majority of the participants of Cade's rebellion were yeomen, husbandmen, craftsmen, and small landowners from Kent, who objected to forced labour, corrupt courts, the arbitrary seizure of land by nobles, the loss of royal lands in France, and heavy taxation. The rebels defeated a small government force sent to disperse them, and then entered London where they were welcomed by those in the city who sympathized with many of Cade's aims. The rebels stormed the Tower of London, and despite failing to take the fortress, executed King Henry's treasurer, Lord Saye. The aims of the rebels were political, and a draft of their Proclamation of Grievances was heavily circulated throughout England before the rebels took to arms. The Proclamation had called for the return of the Duke of York to administrative capacity in the affairs of England, among other things, and an end to the poor governance of Suffolk and his hated affinity.

	#-#The Duke of York was widely thought to have played an instrumental role in the uprisings and general dissidence of the past few years. York's advisors and councillors were accused of indirect, if not direct, participation. The primary focus of Edmund Beaufort, Duke of Somerset, fell on William Oldhall - York's Chamberlain. Somerset had ordered Oldhall's arrest. Oldhall had responded by fleeing to St. Martins for sanctuary where he was subsequently taken by force at the behest of Somerset. the King's pious conscience must have played a part in his release several days after. Meanwhile, York had maintained his innocence, and was by now alarmed by the pressures placed on his Chamberlain. Believing it to be a matter of his own survival and that of England's, he decided to march on the King and have the Duke of Somerset removed from office and placed under arrest. Through his repeated professions of loyalty to King Henry, York declared his actions to be in no way directed against the King. A manifesto was circulated to most of the towns of southern England, and within days several copies had been forwarded to the King. Henry bade his realm to ignore the pamphlets and to obey only royal proclamations. Nevertheless, the political situation deteriorated further. York prepared to move in all haste. He gathered his tenants and retainers from estates spread across southern England and marched to London. Henry, unlike York, enjoyed the support of some sixteen lords with him including the Dukes of Buckingham, Norfolk, and Exeter, and made his way to Barnet. Throughout the various communicative efforts that followed, York maintained his loyalty, stressing that his targets were traitors within Henry's government. Outnumbered, York decided to make for a sympathetic Kent, where he hoped to add to the ranks of his retinue. However, Henry countered and arrived in Kent the day after York, leaving the Duke no time to recruit. Importantly, Henry was now accompanied by the Earls of Salisbury, and Warwick, and the Duke of Somerset, and their respective contigents. York and Henry's forces finally met at Dartford, where York held the field with insufficient forces to coerce the issue. And so, it was at Dartford that York, accompanied by the Earl of Devon, and Cobham, after some negotiations, presented articles of indictment against the Duke of Somerset, kneeling before the King to do so...

	#-#Following Dartford, a panel of arbitrators were created to settle the dispute between York and Somerset. In the meantime, York was made to recite publicly a humiliating oath of loyalty to King Henry at St Pauls. The articles presented by York were aimed against Somerset and were designed to show that the political unrest in England was primarily the result of the King's failure to punish those who had lost France. It was undoubtedly a difficult case to promote, and the articles submitted did not establish the causal connection fully or convincingly. Charges that Somerset had put up an inadequate resistance in France, reduced garrisons, and failed to pay soldiers' wages could be explained by a chronic shortage of exchequer funds. York's strongest points, and those which carried the most substance, lay in Somerset's surrendering of fortresses not then beseiged, and an allegation that Somerset had kept 72,000 francs, which were given to him to pass on as compensation to those who lost rights and property in France. Regardless, to be obliged to take an oath was humilating enough, and for the Duke of York, there was little chance of saving face. Moreover, the panel of arbitrators was to be appointed by Henry and were thus weighted in favour of Somerset. The Crown was not without its share of legal indictments. While most of the Yorkists supporters at Dartford were pardoned, many were put on show trials to demonstrate the majesty of the King, the political pre-eminence of the Duke of Somerset, and the political feebleness of the Duke of York who was powerless to save those on whom he depended. Well over two thousand pardons were granted, as such was the scope of the Yorkist support and of the civil unrest in England. Not everyone escaped such light terms. Many of the gentry found themsleves stripped of their landed possessions, and ultimately attainted in a series of Parliamentary sessions culminating in the infamous Reading Paliament. In the meantime, despite the strong showing of support from the nobles at Dartford, trouble continued for the Lancastrian regime for the remainder of the year, as rebellions broke out in many shires and treasonous conspiracies were discovered in Yorkshire and Suffolk. Despite these instances of discontent, it was clear that the house of Lancaster had received the loyal support of the English nobility at Dartford in a sheer display of strength. York, fortunate to escape any formal charges of treason, was to be confined to his estates indefinately.

	#-#King Henry, who was proposing to embark on a campaign of law enforcement in the provinces, had fallen ill and in this episode rendered catatonic. Somerset and his adjuvents did their best to conceal Henry's condition from the public. Nevertheless, as time progressed, the council could no longer hide Henry's absence and it soon became clear to all that his recovery could not be predicted. Thus, a Great Council was summoned late in October to which Somerset attempted to exclude York. However, the Earl of Salisbury and his son the Earl of Warwick intervened, and sent for York with instructions alluding to the fact that York was to be allowed to press a charge of treason against Somerset, who had for too long enjoyed Henry and Margaret's favour, to the general detriment of the Kingdom and to York. To remedy the current crisis, a series of Parliaments and Council meetings began in November and continued on through April of 1454. Initially, there were at least forty-six peers in London, and they jointly agreed to suppress lawlessness and not sustain each other in any lawless act. With the support of Norfolk, York had Somerset arrested and confined to the Tower of London. However, attempts to resolve issues of executive authority were delayed, mainly by Cardinal Kemp, Henry's Chancellor, who desperately hoped Henry would recover. Matters were further complicated when the Queen submitted a bill of articles, demanding the powers of a Regency, together with sufficient livelihood for herself, Henry, and their newborn son, Edward. The Queen wished to create a household government exercising the role of military Protector of the King and Prince, with sufficient income to sustain its authority and royal power to be exercised by Margaret herself. Fortunately for the Yorkists, Kemp passed away while Council and Parliament continued to mull over the Queen's proposal. On the following day, the Lords sought a sign of recovery from the King, and finding none, moved to establish York as Protector of the Realm. York was not without further difficulties, especially in the north, where Neville hostility towards the Percies found violent outlets. The youthful Duke of Exeter's bid for York's position would further distract the proceedings. Nevertheless, York would manage to secure a degree of stability throughout the realm and would make his first moves to reaffirm the base of support for his regime, however temporary it would be. Thus many Yorkists were ushered into England's government, including the Earl of Warwick's father, Richard Neville, Earl of Salisbury, who became Chancellor.

	#-#Just as suddenly as Henry had suffered his mental breakdown, he became well again. During his episode, the Queen had given birth to a boy, whom they had named Edward. The birth of a son strengthened the Lancastrian dynasty, but it hardly improved the immediate prospects for the realm, or for the Duke of York. York was natrurally displaced as heir presumptive to the throne. With King Henry's recovery, the Lancastrians sized the opportunity to isolate the Yorkists. Warwick, Salisbury and Devon, known Yorksits sympathizers fell to disfavour while the Lancastrians further profited at Yorkists expense. Fearing Henry's possible relapse, Somerset moved to settle the form of government to take place in such an event, and to this end, the summons of a Great Council to Leicester would be essential to give authority and dissemination to any proposed settlement. York had to prevent the Great Council from taking place. The duke of York retired north and, together with his Neville allies, no less alarmed than he, and raised forces. Upon learning of York's actions, Henry sent a deputation to York, but the emissaries were simply detained. Whether because of their failure to return, or some other military intelligence, Somerset woke up to the scale of York's military preperations and, accordingly, sent out summons far and wide. Within days, Henry and his loyal followers set out for Leicester. The Yorkists, however, intercepted the King's army en route, just north of London, near a town called St. Albans. Learning of York's location, Henry decided to relieve Somerset of his command, and appoint Buckingham in his stead. Follwing Buckingham's advice, they sought to negotate. The move for change in leadership was likely motivated by Henry's strong desire to avoid conflict, as Buckingham was related to York and was certainly a much more personable candidate. For Somerset this was a most unwelcome dvelopment, as negotiations could only concern his own fate. Henry and Buckingham's confidence in their strategy was boosted when the royal party were able to enter St. Albans unmolested, despite the town's potential for defence, the Yorkists having arrived earlier in the morning. The Dukes of York and Buckingham entered into serious negotiations immediately. However, both magnates were hampered by other issues. Somerset and Norfolk were deliberately provacative. York, on the other hand, was reserved and confined his request to the points at issue between himself and Somerset. York's insistence on the charges against Somerset put Buckingham in an impossible position, however, for as full as Buckingham's powers were, he could not concede what the King had already denied. Regardless, Somerset could scarcely be expected to co-operate. Warwick grasped the point and opened the fighting while the last embers of negotiation still flickered. Once the fighting had started there was no turning back. The King's banner was displayed, marking York and his supporters traitors, defeat now meant death and forfeiture. At some point during the battle, Warwick took a small contigent of archers and men-at-arms and flanked the Lancastrian forces. They entered the town through a gap in the Lancastrian defence and surprised the King's household retainers. In the ensuing struggle, Somerset was cut down with a pole-axe as were Lord Clifford and Northumberland. Henry and Buckingham were wounded and withdraw. The Yorkists found themselves the victors, located the helpless King, and subsequently proffessed their loyalty to Henry.

	#-#At St. Albans York had fought to be rid of Somerset. Arguably, he had to, as Somerset sought his political demise. Since the first seeds of jealousy were sown in 1440 at York's appointment to the French lieutenancy, English politics had swung increasingly uncontrollably from the one interest group to the other. Somerset was not a great duke, and without Henry he could have been brushed aside by York. However, the King was insufficiently ruthless to completely sever his ties to Somerset, as Ministers who loyally discharged Henry's policies were loyally supported in return. The throne was not imperilled at St Albans. Immediately after the battle, Henry could have readily been killed behind closed doors with no witnesses to survive. Neverthless, the royal standard had been abandoned during the engagement and Henry and his Kingdom were in York's hands. In the months that ensued, instability had reigned, and so when parliament and Council met, it was largely concerned with restoring a degree of authority throughout the realm. Order was gradually restored within the realm, and a return of a favourable House of Commons brought the plums of victory to the Yorkists, though York took little reward for himself. The lords, however, made no progress in settling their various quarrels. For those who had been at St Albans there was an urgent need for a full, authorative, and final exoneration, such that they would be actionable in neither the criminal not the civil courts. The act which resulted was structured around the declarations of loyalty made before the battle itself. In casting Somerset as the traitor and the King as misinformed, St Albans became a loyal action, and by repeating, and enrolling, the letters written before the battle, York was, in effect, making a profuse declaration of loyalty to the house of Lancaster. Whatever the truth of his loyalties at St Albans, at Parliament he was the loyal subject of the rightful King, and this loyalty he publicly affirmed by an act of personal homage before Henry, and was followed in this by every other peer present. These apparent conciliatory actions brought some immediate assurance of York's loyalty, but it did nothing to dispose of the other legacy of St Albans, the internecine rivarly of the great families. It was simply beyond the power of the Upper House to heal their divisions. The need for the protectorate was soon pressed by the Commons and York was the unanimous choice. The opposition was either dead, or browbeaten into submission...

	#-#The terms of York's protectorate were similar to those imposed a few years earlier, however, Henry's deteriorated physical condition had warranted the introduction of an additional clause. Although York was to excercice authority with conciliar authority, he was only to be dismissed upon consent of the Lords themselves, in parliament. The duration of first Protectorate had been at the disgression of an enfeebled, catatonic monarch. Currently, Henry was not considered ill, and the need was to allow the lords to determine when the circumstances had arisen which would terminate the need for York's services. In typical medievil fashion they gave one definition of these, the majority of the prince of Wales, but the lords in Parliament were not anticipating so long a period. York had done well during his Protectorate, however, during the second parliamentary session, the Commons had pressed once again for resumption. York, with such a favourable Lower House, lent his support for such an act which did not take well to the lords. York had thus found himself in a precarious position, as his dismissal was subject to the discretion of the lords. With dissension at court and in parliament, and facing an increasingly hostile nobility, York resigned and soon retreated to his estates in Yorkshire. The lords once again supported Henry, if only to defend their lands from resumption. The realm meanwhile, would be racked with a series of revolts and skirmishes between feuding nobles. The government was itself going through a process of upheaval. The Queen had already determined to establish herself, together with the prince and their respective households, in the west Midlands, and Henry soon joined them. For the next four years England was to be governed from Coventry, but with the routine bureaucratic functions still discharged in Westminster. It was during this turbulent period that the Queen held a council meeting, and, taking the reins of Henry's household, staged a coup. She dismissed the Yorkist installed Chancellor, Treasurer and Privy Seal, and replaced them with Lancastrian counterparts. The Yorkists were now isolated, and thus joined York in the north. The Lancastrians could now safely seek their vengeance, and would make several unsuccessful attempts on the lives of Salisbury, York, and Warwick.

During the Council, however, the Queen refused to reveal the contents of the indictment.

There was little the Yorkists could do other than confront the King and his corrupt Council before parliament could take place.

For the Yorkists, there was now no other option but to presuade King Henry VI to repeal the Act, or to cut down their Lancastrian rivals on the field of battle. There was only one obstacle between the Yorkists and King Henry, however, and that was the Duke of Somerset and his Lancastrian affinity. Henry shrewdly decreed that those who'd sided with the Yorkists and who would now lay down their arms would receive a full pardon, save those who were to be attainted. Thus there were many who refused to fight among the Yorkist ranks. Lacking numerical superiority from the onset, the prospects for a Yorkist victory on the battlefield looked grim. Heavily outnumbered, York, Salisbury and his son, Warwick abandoned their remaining retinues and fled England. Leaderless, their men simply surrendered to the Lancastrian army.

Henceforth, English laws passed in Ireland would need to be accepted in an Irish Parliament. In return, York was recognized as the undisputed source of Royal authority, and it became treasonable act to attack the Duke of York in any way. Soon enough, the officer sent by Queen Margaret, who'd been charged with the responsibility of arresting York, found himself incarcirated, and then beheaded. In frustration, Margaret then named James Butler, Earl of Wiltshire, who was also Earl of Ormond, the King's new Lieutenant of Ireland. Ormond held states in Ireland and was charged with the task of harrying York and establishing the Royal authority in Ireland. Ormond's efforts were futile, however, and Irish hostility sent him home to England. York's position in Ireland was secured. He received homage and secured funding and men-at-arms from the Irish for use, no doubt, in England.

With Warwick in control of England's possessions in France, he was able to secure a healthy donation from the company. He was a popular leader among the English troops in France and a series of successful raids against the merchant shipping of the Hanseatic League had enlarged both the caufers and reputation of Warwick and his men. With these new funds, Warwick prepared to launch another Yorkist assault on Lancastrian England.

In the ensuing struggle, the Lancastrian force was obliterated and Buckingham was slain. Buckingham's death signalled a turn for the worse for the Lancastrians. As the King's appointed Commander, Buckingham had been Henry's Royal guardian. Thus, the battle of Mortimer's Cross ended with King Henry in the hands of the Yorkists. The victorious army marched back to London with the King where they would exert great influence over him. The Yorkist now held London and the King, but the Queen, the Duke of Somerset, and the Earl of Northumberland were still at large and could field an army in the north which embodied widespread roayalist sypathies. Thus, the Lancastrians would eventually respond with an army of English northerners and Scottish troops sent by the Queen and Regent of Scotland, Mary of Guise. York and Salisbury understood that the north would require subjugation, which itself could not be accomplished without the defeat of the key Lancastrian figures whom were leading the northen horde to retake London. York and Salisbury could not have imagined the size of the northern army they were about to confront.

While the Lancastrians reeled from the disaster at Northhampton, the Yorkists had done their best to quell resistance. When York entered London, he ordered that trumpets be played and his sword be held before him in the manner of King, as he marched to Westminster, where the lords of the land were assembled for his arrival. Entering Westminster Hall he walked up to the throne and placed his hand upon it, then turned to the assembled lords. Instead of the rapturous welcome he had expected, he was met with a stony silence that was eventually broken by the Archbishop of Canterbury, who approached him and asked if he would like to see the King. Without the support of the lords for his claim to be King, York, infuriated, set about the task of obtaining the throne by legal means. The Yorkists organized a full assembly of both houses, and seated the King before the full Parliament in royal regalia. The archbishop of York then narrated the alleged misdeeds of government from a text seemingly dependent on the Calais manifesto. Parliament then proceeded, amidst considerable confusion, to elect a speaker. The Commons was unwilling to agree to Henry's deposition. Originally, York had planned his coronation for the following day, but deffered to baronial council after a confrontation with Thomas Neville. Having submitted his claim to the throne, the lords, after a period of deliberation, agreed to accept York's claim, but to decline to give it any immediate effect. Henry was to have the Crown for his lifetime, afterwhich the Crown would fall to York and his heirs. Thus had passed what later came to be known as the Act of Accord.

In response, thousands of Scottish men-at-arms volunteered for the campaign. Upon hearing word of Margaret's alliance with the Scottish Regent, Mary, Warwick utilized the opportunity to unleash a torrent of propaganda. It is possible that the Yorkists had somehow learned the substance of Margaret's alliance with the Scots. Margaret had promised Mary of Guelders Berwick castle and her Scottish soldiers the spoils of pillaging England's village and towns. Regardless, Warwick was quick to issue pamphlets and send heralds all over England with claims that the Queen was leading a massive army of Scotsmen bent on burning, pillaging and destroying all that lay in its path of fury. When the Queen re-entered England, the recklessness of her troops vallidated many of Warwick's warnings, and many villagers swarmed to the Yorkist cause with grave news. London would never forget the Queen's bargain with the Scots, and moreover, would actively assist the Yorkists with funding and troops...

Isolated and vastly outnumbered, Lord Bonville and Kyriell were forced to surrender Henry peacefully. Bonville and Kyriell had treated the Lancastrian King honourably. In return, the King had promised them mercy, but the Queen intervened and asked her 7 year old son, the younge Prince of Wales for judgement. He replied that the two Yorkists should be beheaded. Bonville was appalled and allegedly retorted 'May God destroy those who taught thee this manner of speech!' And with that the two Yorkists were executed on the spot. Without Henry, the Yorkists had little ground for authority. It was no longer possible for Edward to claim, as his father had done earlier, that he had taken up arms in order to remove from Henry the influence of evil councellors. The Commons now acknowledged that the endemic disorder was directly attributable to Henry's weak government. This time, the Yorkists' intentions were to remove him from power and make Edward King. In fact, they had no alternative, for despite Edward's warm welcome in London, he was not in a strong position being, technically, an attainted traitor who lacked funds and the support of the majority of England's magnates. With a parliament in session, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the bishops of Salisbury and Exeter, Warwick, Norfolk, and several other peers held a council at Baynard's Castle. It was unanimously agreed between those present that Edward should be offered the throne. On the following day, a deputation of lords and commons presented a petition to him, begging him to accept the crown and royal dignity of England. Edward acceded to the lords' petition and was shortly thereafterwards proclaimed King Edward IV at Beynard's Castle. However, Edward refused a formal coronation until the Lancastrians were put down in the north.

The Archbishop of York, William Booth assisted him. \n \nAfterwards, there was the usual coronation banquet when Sir Thomas Dymoke, the hereditary King's champion, rode into the hall in full armour, flung down his mail gauntlet, and challenged anyone who disputed Edward's right to do battle with him. On Tuesday 30th June, he was due to attend a pageant before St Pauls Cathedral where a descending angel blessed him. It was a happy and joyful occasion on a fine summer's day. \n \nEdward now completed process of rewarding his faithful followers with titles, although in some cases they would have to wait until Parliament had completed the Attainder processes against the defeated Lancastrian Lords before they could receive grants of land to support their new dignities. His 12-year old brother George, newly returned from his refuge in Burgundy, was created Duke of Clarence. His 9-year old brother Richard, who had also come back from Burgundy, became Duke of Gloucester. Henry, Lord Bourchier, the Treasurer, was created Earl of Essex, and particularly bidden to keep a close eye on the Lancastrians of the Earl of Oxford's affinity in the eastern counties. William, Lord Fauconberge was rewarded for his outstanding loyalty to the House of York, and for his valour on the battlefield with the Earldom of Kent. Sir William Hastings, the knight who had been dubbed on the same battle-field, became Lord Hastings of Hastings in Sussex. Sir William Herbert received the first of his promotions as Lord Herbert.

Edward's first order in York was that the heads be taken down and decently interred at Pontefract with the corresponding bodies. He then issued commissions of the peace for the arrest of any Lancastrian rebels. The Yorkist King was greeted warmly in York and the leading citizens begged him for forgiveness. Edward, taking a conciliatory approach, forgave them freely. His hold on the realm was still tentative, and he needed the cooperation of his subjects and earned it with mercy. Within days, representatives from major towns across Yorkshire came and offered their submission to their new King. Edward's officers soon found several Lancastrian rebels hiding in the city, and rounded them up. Amongst them was the Earl of Devon who was mercilessly beheaded. Their heads replaced those of the Yorkists on Micklegate Bar, grim reminders of the fate of those who rebelled against their rightful sovereign.

From there, she met with her father, and after a brief stay, caught Louis XI in Amboise. Margaret threw herself at Louis' feet, and begged him for assistance against the Yorkist. After a subsequent meeting, Margaret agreed to surrender their claims to Calais in return for French soldiers and 20,000 francs to assist her against Yorkist controlled England. The French soldiers were under the command of Pierre de Breze. The combined Lancastrian and French forces set sail and harried the English coast. Within weeks, the ships landed in Northumberland, although most had been scattered by a storm. Learning of Margaret's intentions, however, several Northumbrian castles rebelled, their garrisons declaring themselves for Henry VI.

The Duke of Somerset had assembled the remnants of Lancastrian supporters primarily from the deceased Earl of Northumberlands estates. The Yorkist were the victors, their army led by John Neville, Lord Montague, and over thirty Lancastrian leaders, among them Somerset, were either killed on the field or executed after the battle. Among the spoils of the battle was King Henry's war chest. Within a short period of time, even the dethroned King himself was found and transported back to London. The battle marked the beginning of a quick end for the Lancastrian resistance in the north, as within weeks the remaining holdings were recovered. The brilliant and able commander John Neville saw to it that, one after another, Lancastrian heads rolled.

Many in his administration were anxious to find him a suitable bride. Edward, however, found one for himself, marrying Elizabeth Woodville, a woman of questionable birth. Although her mother had been Jacquetta of Luxembourg, her father had been a squire, and later promoted to Lord Rivers. Elizabeth was a widow of the late John Grey, a baron who'd died fighting for the Lancastrians. As such she was considered unsuitable both as a bride for Edward and as a Yorkist Queen. Thus the Nobles reacted with dismay when Edward announced his bride to the Council after having kept it secret for well over four months. Warwick, the most powerful magnate in England had been advocating a French bride for Edward in both the English and French courts, and now faced a serious blow to his political integrity. When Elizabeth came to court she brought with her five unmarried brothers, seven unmarried sisters, and two sons from her previous marriage. As members of the royal entourage, the Woodvilles would have to be elevated to a more respectable status than their background could justify. This meant land, titles and marriages into the English nobility. Warwick, among others, would take great personal insult to the influx of Woodvilles, and could do little as marriage prospects for his own two daughters and heirs dissapeared. Nevertheless there was another English candidate for Edward. Eleanor Talbot who, like Elizabeth, was a widowed Lancastrian, but unlike Elizabeth, was not saddled with a large family to promote in court. Moreover, the Bishop of Bath would later testify that Edward had in fact entered into a marriage contract with Eleanor, a legally binding promise which would render Edward's marriage to Elizabeth void on grounds of bigomy. Of course Edward could have bowed to Warwick's whim...

Years of war and instability had ravaged England's economy. Particularly hurt was England's trade. Thus, mutual economic and political interests with the Duchy of Burgundy brought Duke Philippe to suggest to Edward that the Duke's granddaughter, Mary, should wed one of Edward's younger brothers. George, Duke of Clarence, was a rash and arrogant upstart and Edward was well aware of that fact. He was equally aware that Clarence was heir apparent to the throne. A union between his ambitious younger brother and one of Europe's mightiest states would only embolden Clarence and damage Edward's personal relations with Duke Charles in the long run. Furthermore, the Earl of Warwick favoured King Louis XI in France, and so he worked feverishly to promote an marriage alliance between the Yorkists and Valois dynasties. A marriage to Burgundy would severely jeopardize Warwick's standing within European diplomatic and political circles, because Edward had given Warwick the impression that he was interested in an Anglo-French alliance. Edward did not agree to Charles's proposal but would eventualy put forth a proposal of his own that did not involve either of his younger brothers. Alternatively, Edward could have put forward his youngest brother, Richard, who was at that point a youthful Duke of Gloucester.

	#-#With each shameless Woodville promotion at court, Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick fumed as his influence over his cousin and King of England, Edward, slipped further into the distant past. His own enormous family, the Nevilles, owed its vast wealth and prestige to their shrewed and methodical marriages of their many heirs and heiresses for generations. Ironically, the Earl himself with his emense estates had no sons and only two daughters. With Warwick having reaped the spoils of the defeated Lancastrian nobility, his daughters were to inherit the greatest estates in all of England. Now, because of the social ambitions of the Queen's kindred, it looked as if there would be no one of suitable rank left for them to wed. Moreover, Edward had stubbornly refused to let Warwick have the most desirable matches of all, the King's own youthful brothers George, Duke of Clarence and Richard, Duke of Gloucester. Though Warwick had been York and Edward's strongest supporters, Edward feared mixing the potent ingredients that had derailed Richard II, and again Henry VI's regimes. Ambition and youthful Royals with vast estates had tendencies to create civil strife, weaken Kingdoms, and at the very worst, depose Kings. Afterall, Edward was the product of such a situation and was well aware of that fact. Furthermore, the King wished to release himself utterly of Warwick's arrogant and self-rightous direction. Thus, Edward wrote to the Pope requesting he abstain from granting Warwick or any of his brothers, a Papal Bull sanctioning their marriages to the heirs of Warwick, until Edward himself had agreed.

There had been several minor disturbances, and Warwick's agents had been implicated as participants. Nevertheless, Edward refused to believe that Richard of Warwick who had for so long fought for the House of York could possibly be conspiring against him. In reality, Warwick had sought a special dispensation from Pope Pius II to allow the marriage of Edward's brother, George, to Warwick's daughter, Isabelle. The Duke of Clarence and George Neville, Archbishop of York was summoned from London and rode hard for Dover to set sail to France. There, the Archbishop joined George and Isabel in Holy Matrimony. A second rebellion was incited by Robin of Redesdale, this time in the Midlands, where his forces were to be combined with Warwick's and Clarence's. The Earl of Devon and Earl of Pembroke had raised troops for King Edward, but on the eve of battle a quarrel between the two resulted in Devon abondoning Pembroke. In the ensuing struggle, Pembroke's army was defeated and he and his son were taken prisoner by Warwick and summarily beheaded along with Richard Woodville and his son John. Devon was eventually caught and executed as well. Warwick at the head of his army now advanced to seize King Edward.

Thus, when a rebellion broke out yet again in the north led by Sir Humphrey Neville, a member of the branch of the family who had always sided with Lancaster, in order to restore Henry VI, Warwick realized that nobody in the realm was willing to fight for a noble who lacked a commission in the King's name. Thus, when Warwick asked Edward to sign the commission to raise the necessary troops, he failed to recognize that these troops would ultimately obey King Edward over the Earl. Warwick returned with the King's troops having supressed the rebellion, only to discover that Edward had announced that he was going to London. There was nothing the Earl could do. Edward would simply place him under arrest, or worse, if the Earl refused to allow Edward to leave. The nobles of the realm had disliked the Woodville's, and Warwick had done them a favour by executing their most prominent members, however, they weren't gong to support Warwick's big to place Clarence on the throne. And so Warwick and Clarence now found themselves isolated. The Earl and Duke reluctantly attended a Great Council, and were conditionally pardonded by the King.

Warwick and Clarence had betrayed Edward again. This time there would be no mercy, and the Earl and Duke knew it. The two fled, along with many of their supporters for France, where they would eventually seek aid from King Louis XI whom would orchestrate an alliance between the surviving exiled Lancastrians and the traitorous Yorkist magnates. In the meantime, Edward reasoned correctly that Warwick would try for Calais, and so he shrewdly sent orders to refuse Warwick's entry. Duke Charles of Burgundy assisted where he could, patrolling the seas for Warwick.

This paradoxical alliance was bent on restoring Henry VI to power. Priot to Warwick's landing, Henry, Baron Fitz-Hugh, at Warwick's urging, began a rebellion in the North. The Fitz-Hughes were known Lancastrians, and Henry had fought for Lancaster at the second battle of St Albans not too many years ago. King Edward decided to take his men north to stamp out the rebellion, and thus invite Warwick to land. The King planned to subsequently raise troops in the north at York and along his way south to meet Warwick on the field and destroy the traitorous magnate once and for all. Instead, once Edward supressed the rebellion, he found himself an exile at Duke Charles's court. The key difference was John Neville Marquess of Montagu, Richard Earl of Warwick's brother, who had lost the Earldom of Northumberland to Henry Percy. Despite Montagu's exemplary service to the House of York, even in the face of Warwick's rebellions, Edward found he could trust the Nevilles no longer and had deprived John of the Earldom not too many months before. Although Edward had seemingly compensated John for his loss with a promotion to Marquess and estates in Devonshire, John's new estates and offices paled in comparison to what he had enjoyed before in the north. And so the Marquess had decided to support Warwick's bid to reinstate Henry VI as King of England. Edward's men learned of John's plan, and compelled their King to flee abroad.

By the middle of the decade, the restless and still relatively youthful King decided to call Parliament in order to raise taxes to fund his next project: the resumption of hostilities with France. The prospect of a war with the Valois was always a sure means of making Parliament open their purses, and by late June the Yorkist nobility had amassed the largest army sent to France until the First World War: 1,500 men at arms, 15,000 archers and countless horse, cannon and auxiliaries slogged their way through the Flanders mud. At the head of the Royal Army were Edward, Gloucester and Lord Hastings. The plan was for Edward to rendezvous with his brother-in-law, the duke of Burgundy, and their combined forces would call King Louis' army to battle and a second Agincourt would be won by the end of the campaigning season. With the cream of the French nobility once again dead or captured, France would be ripe for dismemberment. Though Edward still pressed his claim to Louis' throne, he had neither the patience nor the resources to undertake the sort of exhausting campaigns of conquest which had destroyed Henry Vs health. Thus, Edward narrowed his demands to the duchy of Normandy in full sovereignty and what in effect amounted to the entire French treasury.

	#-#After it became clear to both Edward and Louis that Duke Charles had no intention of supporting his brother-in-law's venture, both kings agreed to a truce, to be signed on a bridge in the small town of Picquigny. Louis was a shrewd man and realised that one of Edward's primary motives for invading his realm was pressure from the ever-warlike Yorkist nobility. They wanted the same slice of fame, glory and riches that their fathers and grandfathers had enjoyed under Edward III and Henry V - Louis knew full-well that Edward had no intention of conquering his kingdom town-by-town, and so a compromise was reached: Louis would pay Edward 75,000 crowns in return for him leading his army back across the Channel. In addition, Louis would guarantee a payment of 50,000 crowns per year to the City of London for so long as both of them lived. Finally, Louis promised Edward's eldest daughter Elizabeth the young dauphin's hand in marriage, once the royal couple had come of age. For the people of England, Picquigny seemed a surprisingly inglorious step by King Edward, a man they had hitherto associated with persistence, courage and conquest. For their King, however, the treaty represented something altogether more important: financial and political independence from Parliament for the remainder of his reign. Edward was well aware of the lukewarm reception he would receive back in England, but as far as he was concerned he'd taken the biggest gamble of his reign - and pulled it off. Picquigny was important for several reasons: it was an official document signed by the kings of both England and France which in effect put an end to the Hundred Years' War once and for all. Moreover, it showed for the first time since 1066 that England was a lesser power than France, and in particular that she stood little chance of victory when acting independently of Burgundy and/or Brittany - both of whom had abandoned England when she needed them most. Finally, the economic implications of the treaty allowed for the much-needed resurgence of English trade with the Continent, and the Crown was now richer than it had been since the days of Henry II. Inglorious though it was, Picquigny helped substantially to recalibrate the English mindset - before it had witnessed civil war, chronic instability and a series of ruinous conflicts with France - afterwards, the Tudors' blend of strong, popular monarchy coupled with an ever-expanding Royal Navy and a flourishing network of maritime trade: the seeds of the first British Empire had been sown.

	#-#From what Edward IV knew of his opposite number in Paris, Louis XI of France was a meek, shrewd and Machievelian prince - l'universelle aragne, or the 'Spider King' - a man who would rather sell his own liver than face the prospect of renewed war with England, the kingdom whose policy of total war had all but destroyed his father's health and only served to further exacerbate the decades-old feudal infighting in France. What a surprise to Edward then, when only days after his letter to Louis reiterating his claim to the throne of France, he received a reply informing him that their two kingdoms were now at war, and as Edward and his court mused idly in London, Louis' army marched on Calais. Realising the letter was indeed signed by Louis' own hand, Edward despatched his brother Gloucester at the head of a thousand men-at-arms to reinforce the garrison at Calais. As far as Edward was concerned, the people of England would know nothing of his original letter, and therefore Louis had declared war on them without reason or provocation. Thus, with his brother the 'White Boar' headed for France, Edward called Parliament in order to fund his latest war - which they did both quickly and generously, for they believed King Louis the aggressor. For once, Edward believed he may well have finally outwitted the Spider, but until then he had to put his faith in the Boar.

	#-#Edward IV's resumption of hostilities with France in the summer of 1475 relied on a number of factors, chief among them the active support of his brother-in-law and close ally, Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy. Naïve to the last, if there was one man Edward thought he could count on it was Charles, and when the duke finally did rendezvous with Edward he brought with him but a ragged bunch of retainers and a chest of stolen Angevin gold with which to talk him into going back home. To Charles, Edward could not have asked for his help at a worse moment - his patchwork domain was under siege from all sides, including by an army led by the Emperor. In short, Charles couldn't spare a single man or horse, and the only reason he even bothered to meet up with Edward anyway was because his wife had begged him to for fear of losing favour with her brother. Nonetheless, Edward and Charles exchanged pleasantries as the English looked on in horror and dismay at what they had been promised to be a huge Burgundian army followed by the largest artillery train in Christendom. As it was, the brothers-in-law parted ways - Charles returned to Flanders to beg the local rulers for more gold in order to fund his war with the Swiss, whilst Edward realised his much-vaunted 'Great Enterprise' was already at an end and came to terms with Louis at Picquigny. To Edward, Charles' inability to support him and his subsequent embarrassment at the hands of the French amounted to nothing less than outright betrayal. From that moment onwards, Edward had washed his hands of the unreliable and self-serving Charles. Though a bitter blow in 1475, the Duke's death under the walls of Nancy less than two years later gave Edward the chance for revenge he had so longed for: he refused to come to the aid of Charles' daughter & heir, Duchess Mary, and as a result the Burgundian state was destroyed - forever split between the Valois and Habsburgs.

	#-#The treaty signed by two kings on a bridge in northern France in the long, wet summer of 1475 was a long time in the making. In the years since 1453, England had traded the weak and docile House of Lancaster for a much more popular and powerful alternative, the ravenous and warlike House of York. Edward IV's string of crushing victories over King Louis' reluctant and demoralised army over the previous months had broken French morale as at no time since 1415, and once again a king of France faced the humiliation of knowing that several of his most powerful dukes lay rotting in English gaols. By late August, Louis' position was not an envious one - the dukes of Burgundy and Brittany remained staunchly in Edward's camp, whilst the Emperor had made plain his refusal to intervene unless the King of England wished also to make himself King of France. Edward, thinking it best to quit while he was ahead, decided against testing the Emperor's resolve (besides, he knew that any form of Imperial intervention would risk losing him Burgundy's support, whose duke wished an Imperial crown for himself), instead demanding his original, far more modest war aims: the duchy of Normandy in full sovereignty as well as a massive war indemnity to be imposed on Louis' kingdom. Thus, what started out as a somewhat risky enterprise from which Edward expected to gain very little had stunned both sides beyond belief: Normandy had been returned to the English crown, Edward was now entirely non-reliant on Parliament for the remainder of his reign, and any still-lingering doubts over the usurpation of King Henry and the 'legitimate' Lancastrian dynasty had been quashed once and for all. To the people of England, God had vindicated Edward's right to reign by returning Normandy to its rightful sovereign. To Edward the way ahead was simple: he must finish what God Himself had started.

	#-#The rise of Richard of Gloucester to the throne of England was never an immediately obvious one. Gloucester had been exemplary in his continued loyalty and support towards King Edward during his lifetime, especially in stark contrast to their other brother, Clarence, who time and time again had rebelled against Edward's rule, and paid the ultimate price for it. Though the will of Edward IV no longer survives, historians generally believe that Gloucester was to be appointed Lord Protector during his nephew's minority. Afterall, Gloucester, along with Lord Hastings, was the single most loyal and experienced man in the Yorkist camp. Moreover, after Edward's issue he was heir to the throne. At Stony Stratford on the night of April 30th, 1483, Gloucester had Earl Rivers and Sir Richard Grey, the King's half-brother,  arrested for treason and sent to Pontefract Castle, one of Gloucester's northern strongholds. The securing of the young King's person was seen as an effective way of preserving the continuity and stability of the realm under those whom it was considered were best-placed to look after him, and at the time was certainly never perceived as a move against the King himself. Earl Rivers, the Queen's brother, was seen by the Woodville faction as an alternative to Gloucester as Lord Protector, and indeed, it is said that King Edward pleaded with his uncle not to arrest his Woodville favourites. Lord Hastings enthusiastically backed Gloucester's coup at Stony Stratford. Gloucester was simply protecting his nephew from the what was seen as the largely negative and highly suspicious influence of the Queen and her family. For as long as he commanded Hastings' loyalty and support, Gloucester's actions were vindicated.

	#-#If there was one man who could be considered the perfect servant of the House of York, it was William Hastings. Hastings succeeded his father in service to the York family and through his allegiance became a trusted friend and military partner to the future Edward IV, whom he was to serve loyally all his life. He fought with Edward at the Battle of Mortimer's Cross and was present at the proclamation of Edward as king in London on March 4th 1461 and then when the new king secured his crown at the Battle of Towton shortly thereafter. Hastings was also one of the leaders of the 1475 expedition to France, as well as de facto ruler of the kingdom whenever Edward was ill or otherwise absent from court. With the establishment of the Yorkist regime, Hastings became one of the key figures in the realm, most importantly as Lord Chamberlain, an office he held for the duration of the reign and which made him one of the most important means of access to the king. He was also created Baron Hastings, a title reinforced by grants of land and office, primarily in Leicestershire and Northamptonshire. His importance in these years is recorded in a number of sources and was recognized by the greatest peer of the realm, Warwick the Kingmaker, who gave Hastings his widowed sister Katharine Neville in marriage. Furthermore, Hastings supported Gloucester in his coup at Stony Stratford, considering him a safe pair of hands in contrast to the unpredictable and power-hungry Woodville family. With time, however, Gloucester's ambitions boiled over - not content with having himself appointed undisputed Lord Protector after the arrest of Rivers and Grey, Gloucester had Hastings and his entourage arrested at a council meeting in the Tower in June, 1483. Without trial or even a valid sentence against him, Hastings was then immediately led out into the courtyard and executed. Gloucester knew that if he did indeed seek the throne, Hastings would have to go. Of course, he could have been spared, but it was clear from the outset that Hastings' loyalty was always going to be to the children of Edward IV, his sovereign and best friend. Dealing with a man so loyal and popular was always going to be difficult.

Having pleaded with the Queen to release the ten year-old Duke of York from his sanctuary at Westminster, the royal brothers were inturned in the Tower, the traditional residence of a king before his coronation, and in no way sinister or against the ordinary. From here, Gloucester's decisions proved fatal. He was undisputed ruler of the kingdom. According to legend, like de Montfort before him and Cromwell after, Gloucester was asked numerous times to take the crown so as to ensure stability . Eventually, he accepted, though it would of course be naïve to suggest his actions had never taken this into account from at least Hastings' execution, if not right from Stony Stratford. June 1483 was forever the month that  blackened the name of Richard of Gloucester and ultimately sealed the fate of his dynasty. The actions of the man known unto history as King Richard III were at no point a foregone conclusion. On the one hand, Gloucester was a skilled administrator with a proven record of military success, in particular during the Anglo-Scottish war. His arguments for claiming the throne were simple, . Moreover, argued Richard, his nephews were both bastards by virtue of their father's alleged pre-marriage contract. he could provide England with firm and stable leadership. The young Edward was undeniably his father's eldest son, legitimate or not. Could Richard rule as Lord Protector until King Edward came of age, or murder his own flesh & blood and take the throne for himself, risking rebellion, anarchy and complete diplomatic isolation in the process. Not until the days of Oliver Cromwell would an Englishman wield so much power with such devastating results.

	#-#Titulus Regius was an Act of Parliament passed during Richard III's one and only parliament held in 1484, setting out in detail his claim to the throne. It is generally accepted that Titulus Regius incorporates the text of the petition presented by the Duke of Buckingham to the assembly of the Lords and Commons which met on June 25th 1483 at the Guildhall in London and which was presented to, and accepted by, the Duke of Gloucester on the following day, from which date he thereafter considered to be the beginning of his reign as Richard III. The Act makes a number of claims, the primary one being that Edward IV's childen were illegitimate. As it was the intention of Henry VII to marry Elizabeth of York, the eldest daughter of Edward IV and thereby 'unite' the divided houses of York and Lancaster, he did not want any doubts expressed regarding his future wife's status - the Act was therefore repealed and Henry ordered all copies of Titulus Regius destroyed. The text has only survived because it was copied into a work known as the Croyland Chronicle, a single copy of which survived and was discovered in 1619 by Sir George Buck, a noted Stuart historian. The Act goes on to confirm Richard's other brother Clarence's status as a traitor, and thus he (though already dead) and his successors were also barred from the throne. As such, Richard wished simply to tie up any loose ends as to the validity of his claim to the throne and the facts surrounding his nephews' illegitimacy.

The title was first known as Custodes Pacis (Custodians of the Peace), but was later changed to Justices of the Peace. An act concerning Justices of the Peace was passed in 1489. It required that justices devote part of every quarter session to acknowledgment of the areas in which they themselves are particularly weak. The same act provided the general populace with the right to complain about the actions of justices directly to the monarch or his council. The appointment of the justices by the Lord Chancellor at irregular annual intervals allowed for the possible removal of uncooperative gentlemen at the next annual re-issue of the commissions.

After being spared his life on the condition that he swear an oath of loyalty to Richard as his rightful sovereign, Hastings was seemingly out of danger, Richard, however, was not. On April 9th, 1485, the anniversary of Edward IV's death, Hastings and his faithful retainers rose up in revolt, demanding the trial of King Richard for his various wicked crimes against both the late King Edward and his family and the common people of England. Hastings' goals were to oust Richard, restore Edward V or his brother if either were alive, and put Richard on trial in a manner not too dissimilar to that which would bring about the downfall of Charles I. Though popular and respected by many, the fear of Richard's reprisal was greater, and Hastings' rebellion was put down relatively quickly. Hastings was executed and his lands being absorbed into the crown. To Richard, it was Pyrrhic victory, he'd defended his throne on the field of battle, and a major thorn in his side had been removed. On the other hand, his unpopularity with the common people, Hastings had been one of the few reminders of the success and popularity of Edward IV's later years. Now he was gone, and Richard would soon follow him.

He gathered reinforcements as he marched through Wales, then through Shrewsbury, Stafford and Atherstone. Richard was at Nottingham, and moved from there to Leicester on 19 August, and by 21 August the two armies were facing each other about two and a half miles south of Market Bosworth. Richard's army was just under 12,000 strong, but 4,000 of his troops were commanded by the Stanley brothers, whose loyalty was suspect. Henry had only 5,000 troops. During the battle Both the Stanleys turned neutral and withdrew to a defensive position just north of the battlefield, swinging the numerical strength if not to Henry's favor at least improving his situation. The battle was fought on and around Ambion Hill, close to Sutton Cheney, and lasted only two hours. Richard had the better position, but did not take advantage by attacking Oxford while he was still deploying his troops. This allowed Oxford to launch the first attack and the Duke of Norfolk, who was commanding Richard's forward battle division, was soon desperately pressed. For the first hour, the fighting was evenly matched, but Richard lost the battle through the treachery of the Stanleys, who deserted his cause. Even more damaging was of the Earl of Northumberland's failure to bring Richard's reserves into action when he saw the Stanleys withdrawing from the battlefield. Richard made a last attempt to win victory by directly attacking Henry with is personal guard, and almost succeeded, having cut down Henry's standard bearer. Richard's gamble failed, and he was struck down. The battle ended when Richard died. The Stanley brothers and Norfolk immediately started to negotiate with Oxford. Henry fearing that the conflict would spread attended the meeting bringing an end to the miseries of England. It was decided that the Dukes of England was to take part of Government and support their new King, Henry VII Tudor.

On submitting to the young King's will, Gloucester retired to his powerbase in the North, which he would continue to rule on behalf of his nephew with great diligence and popularity until his death. From 1483 until Edward declared his majority in 1490, Rivers and the rest of the Woodville family ruled over an increasingly prosperous and stable kingdom. By 1490 the throne of England had been ruled by two Yorkist kings, the transition between the two being both undisputed and peaceful: a first since the death of Henry V in 1422. Richard of Gloucester never quite forgave the Queen and her family's increasing influence of his nephews, but not once after Stony Stratford did he mention the subject again, instead choosing to accept political defeat and remain a loyal - if embittered - subject of the King.

The concentration of population into cities, however, also created a class of poor, many of whom were willing to became 'indentured servants' and migrate to the North American colonies in search of a better life.

But his son Philip died unexpectedly early in 1506, leaving two male heirs, Charles and Ferdinand which were respectively born in 1500 and 1503. Maximilian decided to support Charles, who in 1516 was already Archduke of Burgundy, King of Spain, Sicily and Naples, in his investiture as King of the Romans and future Holy Roman Emperor. But this diplomatic move would have been very expensive. Most of the German princes were already supporting the French candidate, King François Ier. Maximilian seemed to successfully convoy the favour of the imperial electors towards the Habsburg cause, by means of granting investitures and making promises of large sums of money with the help of bankers such as the Fuggers and the Welsers. The Pope, who couldn't accept the presence of an Emperor with territorial claims in Italy as it was under the rule of Emperor Frederick II, would have supported a German prince like Friedrich III of Saxony, with no particular interest laying beyond the Alps. Looking for international credit, also Henry VIII King of England took part in the imperial election offering his candidature but withdrew soon after the first consultations.

The new King's uncle, Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset, was elected Lord Protector just before the coronation. That year Dudley sought and was duly granted the right to bear the arms of the Earls of Warwick, with the distinctive badge of the Bear and the Ragged Staff. By the end of 1549 most councillors, including Thomas Cranmer, the Earl of Arundel, William Paulet, and William Cecil, were turned against Somerset and united behind Dudley, the man with the ambition, will and determination to oust the Protector. Dudley lead the palace rebellion against Somerset in 1549, leading to Somerset's imprisonment and eventual execution in 1552. Unlike Somerset, whom he had outmanoeuvred, Dudley did not take the title of Lord Protector, and encouraged Edward VI to proclaim his majority. Nonetheless, Dudley effectively ruled the country by holding the two offices of Lord President of the Council and of Great Steward of the King's Household. Dudley was given the title of Duke of Northumberland in 1551. Dudley obtained such an influence over Edward that the King was ready to make it appear that Dudley's ideas were actually his own. Whether or not it was justified, Dudley acquired a bad reputation, becoming known as a 'tyrant', sometimes referred to as the merciless 'Bear of Warwick'. Despite the differing opinion of his character, some argue in Dudley's favour that he consulted the Privy Council regularly, did not make any executive decisions, and did not use the title 'Lord Protector' that Somerset had done. Dudley also began the political education of the young Edward VI.

However, Edward named the Protestant heirs of his father's sister, Mary Tudor, as his successors in a will composed on his deathbed, probably under the persuasion of Northumberland. Both Edward and Northumberland knew that this effectively left the throne to Edward's cousin Jane Grey who, like them, was a staunch Protestant. Four days after King Edward's death, Northumberland had Lady Jane Grey proclaimed Queen of England. Within only nine days, Mary had managed to find sufficient support to ride into London in a triumphal procession on 19th July. Parliament had no choice but to declare Mary the rightful Queen and denounced and revoked Jane's proclamation as having been coerced. Nevertheless, many high-ranking nobles had proved themselves pliable to having Jane as Queen. Acting largely out of financial self-interest, they supported her even if only as part of a power struggle to keep the staunchly Catholic Mary from ascending the throne. Jane's rule ended quickly when the nobles abandoned their support once they realised Mary had won the day. Mary originally pardoned both Jane and her husband, though after a subsequent attempt by their supporters to seize the crown, Mary had them executed for high treason. Had the Protestant plot been successful, Jane would ruled in place of the unpopular and unpredictable Mary, though it is difficult to say what would have happened on the latter's death. Mary's much more popular Protestant half-sister, Elizabeth, would then have been heir, and with her claim being decidedly stronger than Jane's, she would have been her obvious successor, and may well even have been pressured into taking the throne for herself...

The country supported the Catholic Mary's claim, and Northumberland's forces were dispersed by troops loyal to Mary. Lady Jane's life was initially spared, but convinced she did not need another focus of Protestant opposition and a further rival to the throne Mary had Jane and her husband executed on Tower Hill on February 12, 1554.

The premature end of the life of England's first Protestant king had been foreseen by many, and with the martyrdom of that other great Protestant zealot, Thomas Cranmer, in 1556, the short-lived Anglican experiment seemed forever at an end, hastened by the ascension of the staunchly-Catholic Princess Mary in July 1553. In many ways, Mary Tudor was a complete disaster as Queen - not only did her failed marriage to the King of Spain result in many Englishmen beginning to view their ancient kingdom as nothing more than the northernmore outpost of the Habsburg empire, but the domestic policies of 'Bloody Mary' resulted in hundreds of innocent Protestants being burnt at the stake. Despite Mary's indisputable claim to the throne as Henry VIII's eldest legitimate child, many people had wondered whether 'Queen Jane' had not been a better idea afterall. In the end, however, the one thing which threatened to thrust the people of England further into darkness had, in fact, brought them back into the light: the apparent birth of a child in November 1558 - the heir to a combined Anglo-Spanish empire - turned out to be a fatal tumour. Mary died on the 17th of the month, the throne passing to the last-surviving child of Henry VIII, the Protestant Elizabeth: England's Golden Age had begun.

Despite several low-key revolts in her name, successive miscarriages by various Catholic nobles and a failed marriage proposal to the future King of Spain resulted only in Mary further alienating herself from the people of England. Living in almost complete isolation in the royal apartments at Windsor, Mary - guarded at all times by fervent Puritans hand-picked by the Queen - was given few diplomatic options, with letters to and from anyone known to be in anyway pro-Catholic being burnt before reaching her. For both Queens, however, the situation was a difficult one for as long as both of them lived. Despite being deeply unpopular amongst the majority of the English, Mary was the true heir to the throne, being both the eldest sister of Edward VI and daughter of Henry VIII. Jane, though firmly established as Queen and recognised as such among the Protestant powers of Europe, was a usurper, and as well as being excommunicated by the Pope, there were rumours that plans were being made to replace Jane with Mary's half-sister, the Protestant Elizabeth - a most dangerous proposition for Jane, as hitherto her one unwavering strength had been Mary's rabid Catholicism. To Parliament, the true maker and breaker of kings, the choice was a lot simpler: Jane would reign for as long as Mary lived, the crown being offered to the Princess Elizabeth upon her half-sister's death. None of the parties involved with this arrangement were particularly happy about it, but to Parliament it ensured both the Protestant Succession and the continuation of the Tudor dynasty in the male line. Legally and constitutionally the Protestant Succession of 1558 was sound - it was also considered acceptable by the majority of the English people, not to mention undoubtedly avoiding the inevitable civil war had either side taken power by force.

At the same time, she did not want to alienate the significant number of English Catholics, and hence designed a religious settlement that appealed to both Catholic and Protestant moderates. The Elizabethian Act of Supremacy affirmed that she was the 'Supreme Governor of the Church of England', not the 'Head of the Church of England', as her father had been stylized. The Elizabethian Act of Uniformity created a single Protestant Book of Prayer, but allowed the communion to be vaguely worded, so that both Catholics and Protestants could participate. Despite the moderate tone, Parliament only passed the Act of Uniformity by a vote of 21 to 18, revealing that deep religious divides still cut through England.

	#-#Queen Elizabeth I sought to bring about a religious settlement with the objective of establishing in England a protestant Anglican Church. History records that her task was accomplished with the minimum of persecution (just the right amount of persecution perhaps?). Things however began to fray around the edges when Mary Queen of Scots fled to England, seemingly because the Scots got fed up with her mismanagement of Scottish affairs. The problem for Elizabeth I was that Mary was a catholic claimant to the English throne and therefore more than a bit of an embarrassment. So Elizabeth I locked Mary away in various castles. Mary became the centre of numerous conspiracies to overthrow the 'upstarts' who had displaced the ancient aristocracy. The basic idea was to marry Mary to Norfolk, England's only Duke. This combination represented a serious threat to Elizabeth I but Norfolk seemed undecided and continued to delay until Elizabeth I invited him to London whereupon she locked him in the Tower. Elizabeth I had correctly suspected that the Earls of Northumberland, Westmorland and Cumberland were involved in the conspiracy and accordingly invited them to London. The Earls guessed their accommodation would be the Tower and opted instead for a rebellion which began on the 9 November 1569. There was some popular support. The Catholic faith had survived in the North and there was real resentment against the extension of Tudor domination and Elizabeth I. The Earl of Northumberland did muster his troops in Richmond on the 16 November offering great wages to all who came forth and burning for those who did not. On 28 November the annoyed Earl of Northumberland returned with 1000 horsemen and 'spoiled' the town. Around the 23 November a few wealthy inhabitants willingly joined the rebellion (just as it neared collapse). This defection did not go unnoticed and this time the other side led by Lord Willoughby ransacked the surrounding countryside. Sir George was appointed provost marshal and martial law was declared (except of course for the wealthy that was exempt). Elizabeth I ordered that 700 of the riffraff be executed (the wealthy would forfeit their estates to help fund the Crown's costs), 200 of these were to be from or around Richmond. On the 8 January the provost marshal arrived. Questioning of the prisoners began and on the 10 January the executions were carried out. How many were actually executed is not known but seemingly it was a smaller number, perhaps around 57, 12 of whom were from Richmond. The decade after the Rebellion was a difficult period for Catholics who faced constant persecution. Religious meetings were held in secret away from the eyes of unfriendly informants. It seems however that the few gentry who were accused in court of holding Catholic beliefs were the 'mere tip of a great pyramid' which represented a hidden underground movement.

	#-#In 1588, Felipe II of Spain, tired of constant attacks to his fleets, cities and colonies by English corsairs, and outraged by the help lend by Elizabeth to the Dutch protestants at war against him, decided to send a powerful fleet to invade England. Bad leadership, terrible storms and superior English naval tactics and cannons, turned the expedition into a disaster. The crucial point of the expedition, the embarkment of the Tercios of Alessandro Farnese, the Duke of Parma, near Calais, could not be achieved. The return trip was a nightmare due to bad weather and diseases, and almost half of the fleet was lost in the coasts of Ireland. It was a disastrous loss, but not a crippling one, as most of the ships lost were armed merchants and Mediterranean galleases. The Atlantic fleet was largely intact and under repair at the Northern ports of Spain. It was an opportunity too good to pass of leading a fatal blow to the Spanish naval power. But for England it was difficult to quickly obtain financing for such an expensive enterprise, and so the goals were expanded to attract new investors. The fleet was to destroy the Spanish ships under repair, to invade Portugal to trigger a rebellion and instate a Portuguese claimant in the throne, to capture the Azores, and to capture also the Spanish treasure fleet to compensate the expenses for a financially troubled England. Drake and Norris were put in command, but while the destruction of the Spanish fleet was the main goal to the Queen and Privy Council, it was the treasure fleet the foremost goal to the expedition participants. As a result the expedition was a disaster of a similar magnitude to the Spanish armada. Nothing of substance was achieved, and a military defeat at Lisbon, diseases and storms, decimated the fleet, that it is said to have lost 10,000 men. Despite the grave losses, it was worse the missed opportunity, as the Spanish fleet recovered and in the next decade dominated again the seas, shipping three times more gold than the previous decades, while England suffered a chain of defeats: the repulse of Effingham in Azores in 1591, the disastrous raid to Puerto Rico and Panama in 1595, also with great loss of lives, including Hawkins and Drake, the landing of the Spaniards in Cornwall in 1595, and the failure of the Islands Voyage to Azores by Essex in 1597. As a result, James I would seek peace with Spain in the same terms offered by Felipe II prior to the Spanish Armada.

The Anglo-French and Anglo-Spanish competition did not make the things easier for the colonists as the French and the Spaniards induced the Natives to raid and sometimes provided guns and leadership. In this situation His Majesty's Government in London had two possibilities. Either to invest in a perimeter defense of forts and garrisons or let the colonials form into militias and solve the defense on their own. The first solution was costly and London rarely viewed it a viable option. However the price London had to pay was a growing self-assurance among the colonists, a self-assurance that would become a serious problem in 1773.

One of the first scientists to realise the importance of logarithms was Johannes Kepler, who used them in his astronomical calculations. Soon the logarithms became a widespread tool in mathematics, astronomy and, by the 18th and 19th century, in economics as well.

With their aid the Persians captured both fortresses, but refused to turn over Hormouz to them. The East India Company looted goods worth some £100,000 from Hormouz, but the ship was wrecked leaving the Gulf. To add insult to injury the Duke of Buckingham extorted a fine of £10,000 for himself and another £10,000 to the Crown for waging war without permission. However, that didn't stop John Company, as the EIC was commonly known, from continuing to attack the Portuguese wherever they could be found until 1635. One unintended consequence was that Hormouz rapidly declined as a center of trade under the Persians and everything shifted to Muscat.

Intensification of royal judicial procedures (Star Chamber) and demands for taxes (1635, ship money for naval construction) was faced by Parliamentary opposition (summary of grievances in the 1641 Grand Remonstrance) and execution of royal advisors. The arrest of John Pym, the Puritan leader and the Catholic uprising in Ulster (1641) sparked the war between the Royalists and the Parliament. The decisive reform and new model army of Oliver Cromwell (1599-1658) led to the capture and execution of King Charles I (1649) and the establishment of the English Commonwealth, a military dictatorship controlled by a Lord Protector (Cromwell - 1653) and a reduced (Rump) Parliament. Following successful wars against Holland (1652-1654) and Spain (1654-1659), the monarchy would be re-established by General Monk in 1658, to the profit of Charles II Stuart (1660-1688), a fervent absolutist.

	#-#The trial of King Charles I on charges of high treason and ''other high crimes'' began on 2 January, but the King refused to enter a plea, claiming that no court had jurisdiction over a monarch. He believed that his own authority to rule had been given to him by God when he was crowned and anointed, and that the power wielded by those trying him was simply that which grew out of a barrel of gunpowder. The court, by contrast, proposed that no man is above the law. Over a period of a week, when Charles was asked to plead three times, he refused. It was then normal practice to take a refusal to plead as pro confesso: an admission of guilt, which meant that the prosecution could not call witnesses to its case. In fact, however, the trial did hear witnesses. Fifty-nine of the Commissioners signed Charles' death warrant, on 29 January 1649. After the ruling, he was led from St. James's Palace, where he was confined, to the Palace of Whitehall, where an execution scaffold had been erected in front of the Banqueting House. Famously, Charles insisted upon wearing a second vest beneath his shirt that day, so as not to shiver, thus giving the crowd the false impression of fear. \nCharles I, King of England, Scotland and Ireland, was executed despite his son's efforts to save him. However, having England become a Republic, The Scottish Parliament was forced to act appointing his son, Charles II, as King of Scotland, England and Ireland on condition he accepted the Covenant, which Charles II had no option but to agree to. The refusal of the Scottish Parliament to reconsider their religious position against Anglicanism would be an excuse for Cromwell, member of the newly formed Council of State to invade Scotland. Within a year Scotland would be conquered, its Parliament abolished and the Scots forced into an incorporating union with England. Scotland would become an occupied country with Cromwellian citadels. The Parliamentary Union of 1652 and the birth of Commonwealth of Scotland, England and Ireland would however bring an uneasy peace accepted by the people for purely practical reasons.

	#-#During the reign of Charles I England's loyalties were divided between Parliament and the King. Parliament wanted more pluralism and Protestant supremacy, whilst the King, spurred on by the influence of his French Queen, wished to revert to the supremacy of Rome and the Divine Right of Kings, or at the very least, religious freedom for all. In 1645 the New Royal Army formed by Fairfax won two important victories, at Naseby and at Langport, destroying all of Parliaments' armies. In 1646, Charles had little choice but to spread his remaining forces into 'hunt-and-destroy' parties seeking out fleeing Puritan leaders. Oxford pressed the newly formed 'New Model Army' of Oliver Cromwell, forcing them to seek refuge with the Scots, bringing the first war to a close. Charles used the time to negotiate with Parliament, spending vast sums of the Exchequer bribing moderate Parliamentarians. In the mean time, Cromwell's army began to feel their feeble relation with the Scots deteriorate. Eventually the Puritan army tried to kidnap King Charles, however, Charles escaped and used this 'vile and contemptuous habit' to his advantage. Then, Cromwell's army marched south (Aug 1647) and debated proposals of their own with the refugees of the Parliament at York. Charles took advantage of this shift of emphasis away from him to negotiate a new agreement with the Scots, again promising church reform. This agreement leads to a series of Puritan rebellions and an ambitious offensive by Cromwell's Army (Jul 1648). However, all were checked by the far more powerful Royal Army under Fairfax. The New Model Army, angry that the majority of Parliament still considered Charles as King, marched on Parliament and conducted Pride's Purge (named such since the commanding officer of the operation was Sir Thomas Pride). 45 MP's were arrested, 146 were kept out of Parliament, and only 75 were allowed in, and then only to do the Army's bidding. This Rump Parliament was ordered to set up a high court of justice in order to try Charles I for treason in the name of the people of England. Charles took action and surrounded the Cromwellian army, smashing it to dust, freeing Parliament and enforcing his will upon it. At the Great Trial of Treason (Jan 1649) hundreds of Puritan leaders were found guilty and beheaded. Oliver Cromwell then lead the minuscule remnants of his New Model Army to Hull where he was arrested by the Sheriff of York, but escaped to Sweden after offering the City of York his baggage train in exchange for his life. Cromwell later fought with distinction in the Swedish-Polish War, but was fatally wounded at Warsaw in 1656. Charles I was once again King of England, Scotland and Ireland.

The Act directly caused the first Anglo-Dutch war of 1652-1654 and the second in 1665-1667. At the Peace of Breda (1667), New Amsterdam (New York) was exchanged for Surinam (Dutch Guiana) and the Act was slightly modified. It nevertheless contributed to the enormous growth in English naval and colonial trade.

The Dutch, under nominal command of Lieutenant-Admiral Michiel de Ruyter, bombarded and captured Sheerness, went up the River Thames to Gravesend, then up the River Medway to Chatham, where they burnt three capital ships and ten lesser naval vessels and towed away the Unity and the Royal Charles, pride and normal flagship of the English fleet.

	#-#In naval warfare, line of battle is a tactic in which the ships of the fleet form a line, end-to-end. Its origins are traditionally ascribed to the navy of the Commonwealth of England, especially to General at Sea Robert Blake who wrote the Sailing and Fighting Instructions of 1653, but it was already used in the Action of 18 September 1639 by Dutch Lieutenant-Admiral Maarten Tromp. \n \nThe line of battle has the advantage over previous naval tactics  in which ships closed on each other for individual combat  that each ship in the line can fire its broadside without fear of hitting a friendly ship. Therefore in any given amount of time more shots can be fired by the entire fleet. Another advantage is that a relative movement of the line in relation to some part of the enemy fleet allows for a systematic concentration of fire on that part. To fend off this possibility the other fleet too can move in a line, with the result so typical for sea battle since 1675: two fleets sailing along each other or in opposite tack. A ship powerful enough to stand in the line of battle came to be known as a ''ship of the line'' (of battle) or a ''line of battle'' ship which shortened to become ''battleship''. The line is at its most effective when moving perpendicular to the axis of movement of the enemy fleet, e.g. by ''crossing the T'' or by breaking the enemy line and moving through it (e.g. Four Days Battle, Battle of Schooneveld, Battle of Trafalgar), by trying to cut off and isolate part of the enemy's line and concentrating a stronger force on it (e.g. Battle of Texel, Battle of the Saintes), or by trying to 'double up' the enemy's ships (e.g. Battle of Beachy Head). This way the enemy ships block each other's line of fire.

	#-#After the dissolution of the Barebones Parliament, John Lambert put forward a new constitution known as the Instrument of Government, closely modelled on the Heads of Proposals. It made Cromwell Lord Protector for life, in order to undertake the chief magistracy and the administration of government. He had the power to call and dissolve parliaments but obliged under the Instrument to seek the majority vote of the Council of State. However, Cromwell's power was also buttressed by his continuing popularity among the army, which he had built up during the civil wars, and which he subsequently prudently guarded. Cromwell was sworn in as Lord Protector on 15 December 1653. The creation of the office of Lord Protector added an ominous - and to the Royalist faction, extremely useful - element of hypocrisy to the fledling republic, and seemed only to further weaken a series of parliaments already dominated by Cromwell. Conversely, the wielding of such immense power in the hands of by far the single most capable man in government meant that decisions were pushed through a lot quicker, and the nation - at home as well as abroad - had a single, iconic figurehead to swear allegiance to. Just like the Kings of old, Cromwell's image was emblazoned on all Commonwealth sterling. The only thing missing, was a crown...

Instead, Cromwell was ceremonially re-installed as Lord Protector at Westminster Hall, sitting upon King Edward's Chair, which was specially moved from Westminster Abbey for the occasion. Notably, the office of Lord Protector was still not to become hereditary, though Cromwell was now able to nominate his own successor. Cromwell himself, however, was at pains to minimise his role, describing himself as a constable or watchman, not as a supreme head of state.

The people of good standing were poised with either a plundering army or a coalition between the army and political and religious radicals. A return to Monarchy, even with Bishops and House of Lords, but with guarantees for law and order started to sound like a good alternative.

The disease is generally believed to have been bubonic plague, an infection by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, transmitted via a rat vector. Other symptom patterns of the bubonic plague, such as septicemic plague and pneumonic plague were also present. Thought to have arrived from the Netherlands on merchant vessels, records state that deaths in London crept up to 1000 persons per week, then 2000 persons per week and, by September 1665, to 7000 persons per week. By late autumn, the death toll began to slow until, in February 1666, it was considered safe enough for the King and his entourage to return to the city. By this time, however, trade with the European continent had spread this outbreak of plague to France, where it died out the following winter. Nonetheless, a fifth of the city had been killed, resulting in an unprecedented loss of infrastructure and capital.

It destroyed 13,200 houses, 87 parish churches, 6 chapels, 44 Company Halls, the Royal Exchange, the Custom House, St Paul's Cathedral, the Guildhall, the Bridewell Palace and other City prisons, the Session House, four bridges across the rivers Thames and Fleet, and three city gates, and made homeless 100,000 people, one sixth of the city's inhabitants at that time. The death toll from the fire is traditionally thought to have been 16, but a recent book theorizes that thousands may have died in the flames or from smoke inhalation. Nevertheless, the entire city had to be rebuilt under the supervision of Sir Christopher Wren in the following years, thatched roofs were banned, and millions of pounds of infrastructure had been lost.

During the 1670s, 80s and 90s, Sir Christopher Wren oversaw the reconstruction of England's devestated capital. 51 churches - including St Bride's, St Mary le Bow, St Clement Danes, St Benet Paul's Wharf, and St Stephen Walbrook were built to replace the 87 which had been annihilated by the fire. In addition, he was involved in the design of the Monument to the Great Fire of London, Royal Greenwich Observatory, Chelsea Hospital, Greenwich Hospital, Marlborough House, the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, the Wren Library of Trinity College, Cambridge, and many other distinguished buildings. Wren died in 1723 and was buried at St Paul's. An inscription inside his famous cathedral, dedicated to the architect, reads, ''Lector, si monumentum requiris, circumspice'' (''Reader, if you seek a memorial, look around you'').

But they did not manage to subjugate the Native American, whom moved deeper into their vast continent. More or less from the outset the colonists where plagued by Indian raids, pillaging and burning their farms and hamlets. The Anglo-French and Anglo-Spanish competition did not make the things easier for the colonists as the French and the Spaniards induced the Natives to raid and sometimes provided guns and leadership. In this situation His Majesty's Government in London had two possibilities. Either to invest in a perimeter defense of forts and garrisons or let the colonials form into militias and solve the defense on their own. The first solution was costly and London rarely viewed it a viable option. However the price London had to pay was a growing self-assurance among the colonists, a self-assurance that would become a serious problem in 1773.

Like his father - a man whose ghost the indifferent King never could quite lay to rest - Richard had always been a republican at heart, so quite how he managed to rule over his ever-expanding territories as an annointed King for over fifty years was the source of much bafflement to everyone. After several largely insignificant and wholly unsuccessful landings by Charles Stuart and his ever-optimistic Scots entourage, Richard finally gave in to Parliament (a seemingly recurring theme) and signed Lambert's Act of Union, a series of documents and hearings legally and definitively uniting Richard's territories into a single Kingdom of Great Britain. The House of Commons in Westminster exercised supreme judicial and military power over every inch of the new Kingdom. With no elected assembley north of the border and no sizable military garrison to try and lure to their cause, the Stuart Pretender and his friends would have to try a little harder next time...

Monmouth landed at Lyme Regis on 11 June and was proclaimed king in Taunton. Local men -but few notables -flocked to join him, and he had the best of a clash with the Earl of Feversham's royal army on the 27th. He then heard that Argyll had been executed, and fell back to Bridgwater. Feversham followed, establishing himself at Westonzoyland. He had about 2, 700 regulars (including Marlborough) to Monmouth's 3, 500 largely untrained men. Monmouth decided on a night attack, but his men were detected by a cavalry vedette and discovered that a wide drainage ditch, the Bussex Rhine, lay between them and Feversham. Although they fought with courage they were no match for the firepower of the royal infantry, and as they broke Feversham's horse cut many of them down. The rebellion was suppressed with a savagery still remembered in the West Country. Monmouth himself was captured, and executed by a headsman who botched the job entirely.

Over a thousand rebels were in prison awaiting the trials, which started in Winchester on 26th August. The first notable trial was that of an elderly gentlewoman called Dame Alice Lyle. The jury reluctantly found her guilty, and, the law recognizing no distinction between principals and accessories in treason, she was sentenced to be burned. This was commuted to beheading, with the sentence being carried out in Winchester market-place on 2 September 1685. From Winchester the court proceeded to Salisbury, Dorchester and on to Taunton, before finishing up at Wells on 23 September.

Not all Scots accepted the new situation, there were supporters of the exiled Stuart dynasty, the 'Jacobites', which were assemblying forces in areas beyond government's control for the purpose of a counter-revolution. They believed that the natural order of Scottish society, with the rightful Stuart King at the top, was being destroyed by the Presbyterians. William of Orange wasn't particularly interested in Scotland as his life-long struggle was with Louis XIV of France and he relied on the money markets of London and Amsterdam to fund his war with the French. His invasion of England in 1688 was in many ways an indirect war effort against the French King. Scotland was either an irritation or a source of much needed troops to William.

	#-#After Charles I had won the English Civil War he set out persecuting the Puritans, many of whom moved to the American colonies. He also closed Parliament and ruled by decree which created dissent among most groups in the English society. His son Charles II, however, fully understood that the moderate Protestants were the key group and he needed them badly. By introducing religious freedom, disqualifying religion as an issue when attaining a governmental post, and creating an ideology of the Monarch as standing above all religious issues, he managed to create a feeble truce among Englishmen. As a consequence Charles revived Parliament, but greatly diminished its powers. Furthermore, Charles set high standards ensuring fair and regular elections and that every one was equal under law. His brother James was a staunch Catholic and not particularly fond of the opposition that had deified a lot of his ambitions. James, influenced by the Duke of Tyrconnell and the Earl of Sunderland, had the Tory leader, Earl Danby propose in Parliament that the royal suspension power was to be abolished if Parliament passed a Declaration of Rights. In a masterly executed scheme the Whig leader, Earl Shaftsbury, made the proposal fall. King James was outraged and held a speech in Parliament informing the Commons that either he would govern as the appointee of God or they pass a redrafted Declaration of Rights. The choice was theirs and theirs alone. Finally after days of negotiation Parliament accepted what would be called the Bill of Rights, creating a division of powers between Parliament, an independent Star Chamber and the King. Parliament would create and pass laws, and control certain taxes as tax of income and wealth, while the King would approve laws and direct the foreign policy, execute wars and control the majority of taxation. Thus the venerable series of events known unto history as 'The Absolution' came to be. By the early 1690s, James II enjoyed the same level of power and influence as his cousin, Louis XIV of France, and never again would Parliament be in a position to flex its muscles at the House of Stuart...

In 1685, Purcell penned two of his greatest pieces, 'I was glad' and 'My heart is inditing', for the coronation of King James II.

The Anglo-French and Anglo-Spanish competition did not make the things easier for the colonists as the French and the Spaniards induced the Natives to raid and sometimes provided guns and leadership.

Either to invest in a perimeter defense of forts and garrisons or let the colonials form into militias and solve the defense on their own. The first solution was costly and London rarely viewed it a viable option.

Richard was outraged, condemning both the Commons and his role as a constitutional monarch. For years, the King had maintained that the only reason Parliament possessed the power it did was because of his father - and for years, his cries fell on deaf ears. Finally, in 1701, the ailing King made a stand, declaring the Act of Settlement, a piece of royal legislation handing the crown to the eldest surviving heir of Sophia, Electress of Hanover. In the beginning, Parliament was outraged, and issued a writ against the legislation, claiming it was illegal as it had not been through the Commons. A few months later, however, the King's beloved mistress caught Scarlet fever, dying almost immediately. Richard was thrown into prolonged bouts of melancholy, and in a rare of act of sympathy, Parliament finally accepted the Act of Settlement, knowing that realistically, the old and distraught King could never produce an heir.

But the allies were frustrated by their inability to impose the Archduke on the Spaniards, and surprised by their stern resistance, and went too far in their conditions demanding that Louis should remove his own grandson from the throne of Spain by force. This was a humiliation too big to endure, and Louis understood that he was negotiating from a position of weakness and decided to break the negotiations and renew the fight. Time would prove him right, as dissensions were already dividing the allies as the French threat receded. The Dutch and the Austrians were already at odds over the Spanish Netherlands, and the Austrians were seeing as not doing their part, occupied with the Hungarian revolt. The turning point was the unexpected death of Emperor Joseph I, at 33 years of age in April 1711. While Charles left Spain and went to Vienna to be elected emperor, the allies were not ready to reconstruct the empire of Charles V, and England immediately started peace negotiations with France without informing the Dutch or Austria.

This decision, arranged between France and England, was favourable to England, who ignored the wishes of other members of the alliance, forcing them to follow suit. By the treaty with France on April 11, 1713, Louis XIV recognized the new King of England and confirmed the renunciation of Felipe's claims to the French throne. Hudson Bay territory, Acadia, St. Kitts and Newfoundland were ceded, and the demolition of the fortress of Dunkirk agreed. By the treaty with Spain on July 13, England obtained Gibraltar and Minorca, and a monopoly on slave trade with the Spanish colonies for the next 30 years.

By the end of September, most of the Highlands were in his control and his army numbered some 5,000 with more appearing daily. But all this was done without even notifying the King they were claiming to support. The Old Pretender, King James III, was not even aware of the situation as of yet. Word was sent to the King, and the size of the force continued to grow. The Earl, with his growing army, moved to Perth and established his base there after taking the city. Meanwhile another Jacobite army was forming to the south, The Old Pretender hearing the news began to make preparations for his trip to Scotland and his crowning. By early November, the northern Jacobite army numbered some 12,000, mostly Clansmen from the Highlands. The Earl then decided to march south where he soon met the army of the Duke of Argyll, the only remaining government troops in Scotland. The Jacobite forces were mismanaged and split. The southern army marched south to raise Lancashire instead of turning on the Duke of Argyll's flank, while a much smaller force under the Duke defeated the larger northern army of the Jacobites at Sherrrifmuir on November 13th. The southern army was also met and defeated at Preston by other government forces in England. The Jacobites were forced to retreat to Perth, while still waiting for their leader to arrive. The Old Pretender finally arrived in Scotland on the 22nd of December after leaving fittingly enough from Dunkirk. But the matter was already settled, as the Duke of Argyll was already receiving reinforcements of experienced troops and was preparing an overwhelming force to march north. The King, James III, was again forced to retreat after spending a dismal six weeks in Scotland.

	#-#This rebellion of the Jacobite cause led by the Earl of Mar began in 1715. By the end of September, most of the Highlands were in his control and his army numbered some 5,000 with more appearing daily. But all this was done without even notifying the King they were claiming to support. The Old Pretender, King James III, was not even aware of the situation as of yet. Word was sent to the King, and the size of the force continued to grow. The Earl, with his growing army, moved to Perth and established his base there after taking the city. Meanwhile another Jacobite army was forming to the south, The Old Pretender hearing the news began to make preparations for his trip to Scotland and his crowning. By early November, the northern Jacobite army numbered some 12,000, mostly Clansmen from the Highlands. The Earl then decided to march south where he soon met the army of the Duke of Argyll, the only remaining government troops in Scotland. The Jacobite forces were mismanaged and split. The southern army marched south to raise Lancashire instead of turning on the Duke of Argyll's flank, while a much smaller force under the Duke defeated the larger northern army of the Jacobites at Sherrrifmuir on November 13th. The southern army was also met and defeated at Preston by other government forces in England. The Jacobites were forced to retreat to Perth, while still waiting for their leader to arrive. The Old Pretender finally arrived in Scotland on the 22nd of December after leaving fittingly enough from Dunkirk. But the matter was already settled, as the Duke of Argyll was already receiving reinforcements of experienced troops and was preparing an overwhelming force to march north. The King, James III, was again forced to retreat after spending a dismal six weeks in Scotland.

Handel sojourned in Italy in 1706 where he met Corelli, and both Scarlattis. His return to Hanover, four years later, was to assume the post of Kapellmeister to the Elector (soon to become George I of England). In 1712 Handel moved to London where, upon the accession of the house of Hanover, he gained immediate access to the royal circle of England. Handel's London years were occupied primarily with the writing of Italian operas. After suffering a stroke and the failure of his operas, due to cahnge in the public's tastes, Handel wrote oratorios, including 'Messiah' (1741). In addition to operas and oratorios, Handel wrote Psalms, motets, anthems, passions, cantatas, instrumental chamber works, and works for keyboard (primarily harpsichord).

The peace that followed the conflict, provoked by the foreign opposition to the Pragmatic Sanction stated by the former Emperor Charles VI and ended with the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, resulted in a well defined rivalry between major European powers forming essentially two main political formations: the alliance of the socalled 'Bourbon family pact' (France, Spain, Naples and the latest Parma, all with members of the same House of Bourbons) with Prussia and the alliance between Austria, Russia and England. Disappointed by England's interested approaches to the emerging power of Prussia wich led to the Convention of Westminster, a treaty with which both countries would avoid any foreign military presence or access in the German territories, Austria strengthened her political ties with Saxony, Russia and Sweden and started new diplomatic handlings with France, traditionally an arch-enemy of the Habsburgs since the old dispute over the Burgundian inheritance but for sure the most powerful antagonist to the rising British colonial empire. And an alliance with France would also mean the support of Spain and the Bourbon Italian monarchies. That diplomatic move would lead to a huge world conflict fought in the years between 1756 and 1763: the socalled 'Seven Years War'.

It is view appropriate that the colonists pay for the high costs of the Seven Years War or The French and Indian Wars as it is known in America. The colonists however react spontaneously. The Congress of Massachusetts expresses a sharp protest, which is seconded by many other colonies. The most important of the agitators are Samuel Adams, who creates the 'Sons of Liberty' in Boston, and the lawyer Patrick Henry. His Majesty's government decides to send troops to America and order the Governors to dissolve the congresses of the colonies. This increases the revolutionary tendencies further...

The lack of compromise from the British and the spirit of the Sons of Liberty on the colonial side led to the meeting of a Continental Congress which issued the Declaration of Independence on 4th July, 1776. The United States of America were born and would endure nearly 7 years of guerilla and regular warfare, with its lot of betrayal, unrest, torn-families, defeats and victories (Saratoga 1777, bringing in the French alliance in 1778, and Yorktown 1781) that would finally lead England to concede defeat, lose all the territory of her former 13 colonies, and recognize the American independence at the Treaty of Paris in 1783.

	#-#The American Revolution shattered the British Empire in North America. The conflict was rooted in British attempts to assert economic control in her American colonies after her costly victory over the French during the Seven Years War. When protests and riots met the British attempts to impose taxes on the colonists, the British responded with political and military force. Out of the struggle between the Thirteen Colonies and their mother country emerged two nations: the United States and what would later become Canada. Not all of the inhabitants of the Thirteen Colonies opposed Britain. The United Empire Loyalists were those colonists who remained faithful to the Crown and wished to continue living in the New World. Therefore, they left their homes to settle eventually in what remained of British North America.

Heavily occupied by British troops isolated insurrectionists held on to the flag of freedom with guerilla attacks. The British Government though took certain measures, making all colonists British citizens and all territories of His Majesty's Government equal in rights and power. Most so-called 'Americans' still felt themselves being different from the average Londoner, but King George's rule was just and fair. Slowly the insurrectionists attacks started to strike back at themselves as ordinary people started to view them as brigands. In pace with their failure to get support they become more radical and when the French Revolution appeared they happily picked up that ideology of violence and hatred. The Reign of Terror in France and the British problems in Quebec quickly made ordinary people to flock to the English banners. The British Government seized the initiative and issued the Act of the North American Union. All colonies would now become province with their own parliament fully empowered for local governance. The same would be true for the Motherland. The British Government in London and the Grand Parliament would now also accept and include members from the North American Union. This decision was very successful and with the power of the New World behind her back London could much direct the decisions of the Congress of Vienna in 1801.

The problem was the inexactitude of the clocks at that time. Finally John Harrison built an extremely precise clock, his first clock was built in 1715, and by 1727 he had made a very fine clock with a 'gridiron' pendulum which consisted of nine alternating steel and brass rods to eliminate the effects of temperature changes (the clock is now known as H1). H2 was built in 1739 with further innovative features. Finally H4 was completed in 1761, and satisfied all the conditions. The problem had been solved!

The british astronomer was a patient, careful observer, who visually scanned the entire northern sky with the largest reflecting telescope of his era, constructed by himself. The two Uranus' largest moons, Titania and Oberon, were also discovered by William Herschel in 1787.

	#-#William Blake was born to a middle class family in London on 28 November 1757. Blake worked in his father's shop until his talent for drawing became so obvious that he was apprenticed to an engraver at the age of 14. Finishing his apprenticeship at the age of 21, Blake set out to make a living as an engraver. Blake, however, was not much of a businessman and much more interested in exploring the mystical visions he claimed he had. He explored his visions through his poetry, which was all printed with accompanying illustrations engraved in copper plates (through a method he claimed he 'received' in a dream. Although Blake's poetry was never recognized by many during his life, he was sufficiently intriguing to the elites to belong to a circle of radicals in London which included William Godwin, Mary Wollenstonecraft and Thomas Paine. Blake was a revolutionary that especially hated the doctrinaire attitude of organized religion, 'Remove away that black'ning church:/Remove away that marriage hearse:/Remove away that place of blood:/You'll quite remove the ancient curse' but hated Voltaire and Rousseau just as much for they were prophets of the unspiritual, the rational and scientific life. Blake's poetry paved the way for the transcendentalism of later poets (especially in the United States) and, paradoxically, represented the anti-intellectualism which was so important to the advent of nationalism and the 20th Century's totalitarian states. He also was one of the first writers to react to the Industrial Revolution. His poetry and illustrations rank among the best ever produced in the West. His most famous series of poems today are 'Songs of Innocence/Songs of Experience', which was first printed in 1783. He died in 1827 and was buried in an unmarked grave.

	#-#William Pitt was the second son of William Pitt, 1st earl of Chatham. In December 1783, King George III took the opportunity to dismiss the coalition and asked the 24-year-old Pitt to form a government. When Parliament reassembled in January 1784, the government was at once defeated by 39 votes on a virtual motion of censure, but Pitt refused to resign, and gradually the coalition's majority in Parliament began to crumble. By March 8 the majority against him was one vote, and on March 25 Parliament was dissolved. In 1788 he signed the Triple Alliance between Britain, Prussia, and Holland, thereby ensuring that in a future war his country would not be bereft of allies as it had been during the American Revolution. In 1790 he demonstrated Britain's renewed power and prestige by negotiating a peace between Austria and Turkey. In 1784 he passed his own India Act, creating a board of control regulating Indian affairs and the East India Company. Finally, in 1791 the Canada Constitutional Act was passed. London became responsible for the government of both Lower and Upper Canada, but both provinces were given representative assemblies.

Parliament decided to have the Lord Chancellor approve the bill by fixing the Great Seal of the Realm to give Royal Assent. However, the King recovered in time before the bill could be passed. The Duke of York and others thought the act illegal, but following his recovery, the King declared that the government had acted correctly. The King's continuing mental problems throughout the rest of his life confirmed the need for a suitable Regency Act to be in place. However, the King was hostile to the passing of such an act while he was of sound mind.

Secondly, England was at war with France since 1 February 1793 and would be very much interested in gaining strategical ports and strongholds in the Mediterranean Sea.

The island was surrendered without a single shot fired, as the Grand Master Ferdinand von Hompesch was faced with the prospect of mutiny from the French knights, who refused to fight against their countrymen. On the night of June 17th, 1798, the Grand Master left his palace and the island, taking with him but a few religious artifacts. The French however did not have a chance to settle down on Malta. Their reckless pillaging resulted in a full-scale uprising in a matter of months. The Maltese, supported by Portuguese and English forces, retook the island. On the 15th of June, 1802, a group of Maltese nobles, led by Marquis Testaferrata, offered the island to the British crown. Soon it proved to be invaluable, serving as a perfect operating base for the English fleet after the declaration of Napoléon's continental blockade.

Largely influenced by Adam Smith, he devised his own theories now considered foundational to the British Classical Economy School. His underlining of the roles of trade and international exchange, advocating the suppression of tariffs and duties and generally promoting freer trade are examples of this. It is thus no surprise that Ricardo was opposed to the Corn Laws (the prohibition on importing grain into England). One of his theories was that the value of goods depended mainly on the amount of work that went into its production. Ricardo's Theory of Value later influenced Marx, who linked it to his theme of the exploitation of the labourer's work. Ricardo also built the theory of the 'gold standard', recommending the issuing of money to be in close correlation with national gold reserves, in order to limit inflation.
