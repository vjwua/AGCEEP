The Prince of Transylvania, Sigismund Báthory, nephew of former Polish King Stefan Batory, had strengthened Habsburg influence in Moldavia after setting Stefan Razvan on the Moldavian throne.

The Commonwealth forces under hetman Jan Zamoyski crossed the Dniestr, defeated local opposition and Ottoman reinforcements, and set Ieremia Movila on the Moldavian throne as a Commonwealth vassal. This was seen by many as very dangerous step because Ottomans were preparing to place their own candidate on Moldavian throne.
