	#-#In the first decades of the XVII century fierce religious struggles unceasingly prosecuted in the Low Countries and the Catholic army took up the offensive in the Netherlands winning victory after victory. The Dutch again opened the dykes to flood the enemy, but it backfired and they lost most of their elite troops. In 1625 Breda capitulated, and in 1627 Nijmegen fell, while the Lansquenets moved into Geldern and threatened Utrecht. But the best was yet to come. After winning a night-time sea battle the Catholic navy landed a large army in Zeeland, and within a year control was regained over the quarrelsome subjects. During the years until the Peace of The Hague, all non-Catholics were harshly subjugated. Catholics were given preferment and local self-governance. A pact between all the Catholic subjects and the suzerain was instituted. Many Calvinists, unwilling to be force-converted to Catholicism, had to leave the Netherlands for the newly born overseas colonies in South Africa and in the South East Indies. In 1648 with the end of the Eighty Years War against the Dutch rebels, the world at last acknowledged our rightful rule in the Low Countries.
