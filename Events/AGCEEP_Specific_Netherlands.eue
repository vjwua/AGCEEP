Sometimes, the oath is interpreted as an act of secession from Spain, but this is strictly speaking incorrect, as the provinces were never legally incorporated into the Spanish Kingdoms, but were only bound to them by the looser tie of personal union. Legally, the oath deposed the provinces' current ruler, Philip of Habsburg - who, by dynastic coincidence, was also King of Spain. Philip's attempts to unify his various realms under a more centralized government based in Madrid were the major drivers behind the oath. Philip used troops from Spain and other areas loyal to him (such as Wallonia and Italy) to fight the rebels. In the Oath, the Staten-Generaal (the General Estates, a sort of federal parliament) assert that a King is a servant of his people and should respect their laws and traditions. When he no longer does this, the people have the right to choose another ruler.

The inundation of land proved to be very usefull against the Spanish during the 80 years war and the waterlinie protected Holland from Louis XIV's invasion in 1672. However the farmers were not very happy with it.

	#-#Dutch artists had quite different customers from their colleagues in other European countries, where church and nobility were major patrons. This had an influence on the themes they depicted and their pictorial style. Also many paintings were not produced for commission and found their way to auctions and art traders. This fostered specialization, by which less than brilliant painters could dedicate themselves to themes of their own choosing and still excel in a particular genre. The most famous Dutch artists from this age are Rembrandt van Rijn, Jan Steen, Johannes Vermeer and Pieter Breughel, but hundreds of others worked in the same period. \n \nDutch architecture was also taken to a new height in the Golden Age. Due to the thriving economy cities expanded greatly. New town halls, weighhouses and storehouses were built. Merchants that had gained a fortune ordered a new house built along one of the many new canals that were dug out in and around many cities (for defense and transport purposes), a house with an ornamented façade that befitted their new status. In the countryside, many new castles and stately homes were built. Alas, most of them have not survived. \nEarly in the 17th century late Gothic elements still prevailed, combined with Renaissance motives. After a few decades French classicism gained prominence: vertical elements were stressed, less ornamentation was used, natural stone was preferred above bricks. In the last decades of the century this trend towards sobriety intensified. From around 1670 the most prominent features of a housefront were its entrance, with pillars on each side and possibly a balcony above it, but no further decoration. \nStarting at 1595 Reformed churches were commissioned, many of which are still landmarks today. \nThe most famous Dutch architects of the 17th century were: Jacob van Campen, Pieter and Maurits Post, Pieter Vingbooms, Lieven de Key, Hendrick de Keyser.

In 1650 under the stadholderate of Willem II the conflict flared up again, due to a series of failed harvests and epidemics. Willem II staged a succesfull military coup, but he died of smallpox the same year and with his succesor being only an infant his supporters failed to achieve victory. This lead to the start of the first stadholderless age under the De Wit regency.

He sent a letter to the VOC's Governor of Taiwan in August 1655. The Spanish, wrote Chenggong, had been mistreating his sailors, and he had therefore issued an edict that forbade Chinese to sail to Manila on pain of death. He enclosed a copy of the edict and requested that the Governor propagate it in Formosa and enforce it by confiscating the junks and property of any who disobeyed. But the language of the edict raised the hackles of the VOC. First, it said that the Dutch ''behave more like animals than Christians.'' Second, it referred to Chinese who lived in the Dutch colony as Chenggong's subjects. Third, and most important, it threatened punishment not only for Chinese but also for ''anyone outside of our nation who extends money for trade with Manila.'' If company officials did as Chenggong asked and published the edict, they would be admitting that Chenggong had sovereignty over the Chinese colonists in Formosa. The Governor and the council decided they must refuse Chenggong's request to preserve ''the sovereignty of the Netherlanders.'' They replied with a ''compliment letter,'' which politely declined his request. The VOC also sent a small fleet to the coast of China, but they found no sign of preparations for invasion. However, Zheng seems to have intimidated many of the Chinese merchants who normally came to trade in Taiwan because very few would brave his displeasure over the next few years.

#(1678) Baruch Spinoza (1632-77)

	#-#Baruch Spinza (1632-77) was born to Portuguese Jews who had emigrated to the Netherlands in order to escape the Inquisition. His early education was Talmudic, but he was excommunicated from the synagogue at Amsterdam for defending heretical ideas in 1656. At about that time he abandoned the Hebrew form of his name, Baruch, for its Latin equivalent, Benedict. Writing and studying in private, Spinoza supported himself through a series of grants, pensions and bequests. He was also a lens grinder of great skill, an occupation which he probably pursued out of scientific interest and which probably led to his death by consumption. Private circulation of his philosophical treatises soon garnered him a reputation throughout Europe and, in 1673, he was offered a post at Heidelberg. Spinoza, however, turned the job down, preferring to work alone. Spinoza's first serious work was The Principles of Descartes' Philosophy (1663). It presented Descartes' thoughts with suggestions for its improvement. In 1670, Spinoza published A Theologico-Political Treatise, (the only work he published in his lifetime) which criticized the House of Orange's militant Protestantism, defended religious toleration, and argued that the anthropomorphic conception of God was logically and theologically unsound. He proposed historical-critical methods for biblical interpretation. In the year of his death, 1677, his Ethics came out. It argued in an Euclidean fashion that the world was a monad - an ancient sophist position defended most famously by Zeno and derided most famously by Aristotle - and that that monad was God, thus paving the way for the transcendentalism of the Romantic period. His 'pantheism', however, was regarded as heresy in his day, which is probably why he only published once in his lifetime.

Almost a hundred years later his grandson, Louis XIV, striving for unity and stability in the realm, views the co-existence of the two churches as a potential source of disturbances. Having already allowed the persecution of Protestants and the burning of their churches, he in 1785 revokes the Édit De Nantes. Within a few years, more than 400,000 Huguenots emigrated to England, Prussia, Holland, and America - depriving France of its most industrious commercial class.

He was related to several royal families in Europe, but after the death of the designated heir, Joseph Ferdinand Wittelbach of Bavaria, at the age of six, the royal houses of Austria and France had a similar claim. But both were too powerful, and the addition of the Spanish empire would make any of them unstoppable, and so candidates not destined to their thrones, Philip of Anjou and Charles Habsburg, were discussed as heirs to Carlos, and several partition agreements were negotiated. That is precisely what everybody wanted to prevent in Spain. Despite the bigger influence from the Austracist party led by the mother of Carlos, there was an indisputable fact: France had 300,000 soldiers next to Spain and the Spanish Netherlands, and so represented the only opportunity, albeit small, to keep the empire together. A will was redacted and the agonizing Carlos signed it. It bequeathed the Kingdom to Philip Anjou, but it contained two crucial clauses, the condition that the crowns of France and Spain should never be held by the same person and that the Spanish possessions could not be divided. Austria, of course, rejected it, but the rest of Europe seemed to agree, as the equilibrium was not broken. But Louis misjudged the uneasiness that the rest of Europe displayed for the French expansionism, and made several mistakes after the Spanish succession. He closed the Spanish-American commerce to the English and the Dutch, and French troops occupied the fortresses in Spanish Netherlands. In February, the French States had ratified the right of Philip of Anjou to the crown of France, violating the will of Carlos II. The maritime powers had the motive and the excuse, and Austria discovered that now she had allies for the war of Spanish succession.

But the allies were frustrated by their inability to impose the Archduke on the Spaniards, and surprised by their stern resistance, and went too far in their conditions demanding that Louis should remove his own grandson from the throne of Spain by force. This was a humiliation too big to endure, and Louis understood that he was negotiating from a position of weakness and decided to break the negotiations and renew the fight. Time would prove him right, as dissensions were already dividing the allies as the French threat receded. The Dutch and the Austrians were already at odds over the Spanish Netherlands, and the Austrians were seeing as not doing their part, occupied with the Hungarian revolt. The turning point was the unexpected death of Emperor Joseph I, at 33 years of age in April 1711. While Charles left Spain and went to Vienna to be elected emperor, the allies were not ready to reconstruct the empire of Charles V, and England immediately started peace negotiations with France without informing the Dutch or Austria.
