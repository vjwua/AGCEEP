	#-#Felipe V was well accepted in all of Spain, and recognized as King by all the parliaments. However with the start of the war and the arrival of the French troops, and with the proclamation of Charles Habsburg as King in Vienna, his supporters (Austracists), were ready to change sides. Although there were supporters for both monarchs in all regions of Spain, the disenchantment with the Habsburg rule and the admiration for the French centralized model was higher in the former Kingdom of Castile, while in the former Kingdom of Aragon, besides the opposite sentiment, there was a profound hatred of the French for the loss of the Roselló and the bombardment of Barcelona by the French fleet a few years before.
