Such a large city required huge amounts of food, food that was sent to the capital from surrounding settlments. One after another, settlements along the fringes of the state began to break away, many of them to the northern Mwenemutapa Empire, that had itself broken away from Zimbabwe around 1400. As Mwenemutapa gained control of the valuable Swahili trade, trading goods from afar became scarcer and dearer. Gold, which was used mainly to buy overseas goods to appease the nobility, was now almost worthless. Sensing the end, people began to desert the city of Great Zimbabwe.

Their leader was given the title Mwene Mutapa, 'one who explores', and this became the name of the state as it began to absorb other Zimbabwean settlements. Over the next century Mwenemutapa grew until it controlled the northern half of the Zimbabwean Plateau and had gained control over the valuable Swahili trade. Around this time the Portuguese were attempting to take control of the Swahili coast and they settled along the Zambezi, trading with the Mwenemutapa and ignoring Great Zimbabwe. As Zimbabwe itself had done to the Mapungubwe, so now the Mwenemutapa were doing to them. The Mwenemutapa continued to grow, gradually becoming the dominant power in the region. The Portuguese were disappointed with the gold they found, however, and turned their attentions to the Americas instead.
