Worst of all, however, was the unbalanced distribution of land. The crown lands were too small to provide the vital taxes needed to support the state. The King proved up to the challenge, and with unpopular reductions and obsessive micromanagement he got the country back on its feet.

He was an able King who reformed the army and pursued an aggressive foreign policy, securing the northern part of Estonia for Sweden in 1561. However, his relation to his brother John, the Duke of Finland, plummeted when the latter married a Polish princess against the King's will. John and his wife were sentenced to death (but later pardoned) and imprisoned until the paranoid King Erik suffered a period of insanity and stabbed one of his advisors to death in 1567. Fleeing into the countryside, the King was found wandering a few days later and eventually recovered. However his brothers (except Magnus, who went insane in 1562) conspired against him and managed to depose him in 1568. Erik died in prison in 1577 - probably murdered at the order of King John.

However, Sigismund's Catholicism alienated him from many important Swedish nobles who could not stomach the thought of seeing their country revert to papism.

Sigismund returned with an army but was defeated at Stångebro in 1598, which effectively ended the brief union.

	#-#John III had a son named Sigismund who was crowned King of Poland-Lithuania in 1587. Although his father was a Lutheran (albeit one who sought reconciliation with the Pope), he was raised a catholic by his mother and was tutored by Jesuits. When John died in 1592, Sigismund also inherited the Swedish crown, creating for a few years the most powerful political entity in Europe. However, Sigismund's Catholicism alienated him from many important Swedish nobles who could not stomach the thought of seeing their country revert to papism. Sigismund's uncle Charles rose up in rebellion as soon as the King had left for Poland after his coronation in 1594. Sigismund returned with an army but was defeated at Stångebro in 1598, which effectively ended the brief union. For decades to come, the Polish Kings would regard Charles and his successors as usurpers - a claim that would spark several bloody wars between the nations.

The Swedes were even persuaded by certain Dutchmen to embark on lucrative colonial ventures, but the attempts were half-hearted as Sweden chose instead to pursue an aggressive continental policy. Swedish trade never really took off either, due to the constant mercantilist interference of a money starved government.

So this brief document purported to do no more than enforce the terms of the Peace of Augsburg. However, the interpretation put on that document was that which had been urged by partisans of Catholicism. Thus it became the source of outrage for King Gustav II Adolphus of Sweden (the Lion of the North) who, like Christian IV before him, came to aid the German Lutherans to forestall Catholic aggression against their homeland and to obtain economic influence in the German states around the Baltic Sea which were being threatened by the growing influence of the imperial authority.

Apart from his centralization efforts and huge reduction of aristocratic land holdings he also remodelled the army. Most importantly, he devised the genial 'indelningsverk', or military-tenure system. The system was a military organisation where the soldiers were given a croft to live in and cultivate (made possible by the reduction), where the harvest served as their wages. Thus the country could maintain a large army in both times of peace and of war. If a peasant assumed the responsibility of maintaining an enlisted rider, his horse and equipment, he was exempted from conscription and freed from paying taxes. The peasants could cooperate in groups of 2-5 farms and maintain a soldier or a sailor. The soldiers were organized into companies of 150 men, and every county should field a regiment of 1200 men. The new system also made no distinction between officers of noble birth and commoners.

However, with British and Dutch naval assistance, Charles XII landed on Zealand and promptly defeated the Danes, then moved to Estland where his badly outnumbered Swedes (1 to 5) won a crushing victory over the Russians. Instead of finishing the Russians, Charles moved against August II of Poland-Saxony and drove him out of Poland in 1704 (having the pro-Swedish Stanislas Leszinski elected King), then subjugating Saxony in 1706. While the Russians started the construction of St-Petersburg (1703) and rebuilt their armies, they also took parts of Estland (1704-1706). Charles then decided to march to Moscow via the Ukraine where the Cossacks under Mazeppa had again risen in revolt (1708). The harsh winter and Russian raids decimated his army and he was finally beaten at the battle of Poltava in 1709. The wounded King escaped to the Ottomans. The Russians were encircled by the Ottomans on the Prut River, but Peter succeeded through bribery to obtain a safe conduct in exchange for Azov. While Charles was still exiled in Turkey, Russian, Danish, Hanoverian and even Prussian troops captured most of the Swedish territory around the Baltic. Having emerged from Turkish internment, Charles got killed in 1718 in front of the Norwegian fortress of Frederickshald. The peace treaties that followed Sweden lost most of her Baltic empire.

The peace that followed the conflict, provoked by the foreign opposition to the Pragmatic Sanction stated by the former Emperor Charles VI and ended with the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, resulted in a well defined rivalry between major European powers forming essentially two main political formations: the alliance of the socalled 'Bourbon family pact' (France, Spain, Naples and the latest Parma, all with members of the same House of Bourbons) with Prussia and the alliance between Austria, Russia and England. Disappointed by England's interested approaches to the emerging power of Prussia wich led to the Convention of Westminster, a treaty with which both countries would avoid any foreign military presence or access in the German territories, Austria strengthened her political ties with Saxony, Russia and Sweden and started new diplomatic handlings with France, traditionally an arch-enemy of the Habsburgs since the old dispute over the Burgundian inheritance but for sure the most powerful antagonist to the rising British colonial empire. And an alliance with France would also mean the support of Spain and the Bourbon Italian monarchies. That diplomatic move would lead to a huge world conflict fought in the years between 1756 and 1763: the socalled 'Seven Years War'.
