After some insults, the two escorts launched into a confused fray during which John the Fearless received a fatal blow from an axe. For Burgundy, the only possible response to this affront was to ally with King Henry and crush this so-called Dauphin traitor!

	#-#The Treaty of Troyes grew primarily from the seeds ofHenry V's desires to press his claim to the throne of France, and thereby vindicate the Lancastrian usurpation of 1399 in the hearts and minds of the people of England. Indeed, it was the warrior King Edward III, Henry's great grandfather, who had pressed his claim and had inititiated the war with France decades ago. Henry's marriage to Katherine Valois, a daughter of Charles VI, was designed, in part, to add an element of legitimacy to Henry's future should he become King of France. The agreement which formed the basis of the treaty was that the Dauphin, Charles, was to be disinherited by his father and Henry V named heir in his place. The treaty committed Henry to conquer those lands in France currently held by the Dauphin Charles and his supporters. An important clause, however, maintained that any and all lands in France which Henry V held or may hold could not be detached from the Crown of France. Furthermore, the institutions of France were to be upheld and respected. Notably, the Duchy of Guyenne was exempted from this clause. Nevertheless, there were other options, as Henry could have exchanged the extraordinary prisoners from Agincourt, the Duke of Orleans and the Duke of Bourbon, among others, along with his claim to the Crown of France, for the Duchies of Normandy and Guyenne in full sovereignty. Orleans and Bourbon, the notable leaders of the Armagnac alliance along with the Dukes of Berry, Alencon, and the late Count of Armagnac Bernard VII, had offered Henry the Duchy of Guyenne in full sovereignty prior to Agincourt. Henry's father, Henry IV, had worked hard for an alliance with the Armagnacs during his reign. Henry V, however, had always preferred an alliance with Burgundy and had openly criticised his father's policy. Alternatively, though at a great cost to the stability of his regime and his own legacy, Henry could have renounced the claims to Normandy and the Crown of France altogether. Regardless, France is ripe for our demands...

It was in effect a return to Henry's demands before the bulk of HEnry's forces had landed in Normandy, and to what the Armagnacs had promised him years before. Charles Duke of Orleans along with Jean Duke of Bourbon, after spending several years as prisoners in London, were ransomed back to France and lent the treaty their full support. Most importantly, Henry V was to renounce his claim to the throne of France. Charles VI was constrained to agree to Henry's proposal. The English were pacified and the Armagnacs claimed political success. Eager to solidify popular support and capture an air of legitimacy, the Kings of England and France, and the Dukes of Bourbon and Orleans would hold a public ceremony in Paris where each swore an extraordinary oath on behalf of themselves and their blood lines to uphold the treaty stipulations. Henry V formally renounced his claim to the throne of France. The Duke of Burgundy, who had stormed out of the Troyes negotiations, refused to attend the ceremonies. Eager to garner the support of the realm for his decision, Henry V wasted no time calling to session a Parliament that quickly ratified the treaty. Nevertheless, Guyenne was held by the Dauphin and his supporters, and it was clear that Henry V would need a lasting peace with Charles Dauphin of France.

England had little to show for Henry's miraculous success on the fields of France, save a youthful French Princess and the possessions of Gascogne and Calais, both of which were now mortgaged to the Crown. Disillusioned, many began to view this as an outrage, and it rumours began to circulate widely that the King had abandonded his subjects, nobles and commons alike, at Troyes. Few had escaped many of the great sacrifices at home, and fewer still had reaped the spoils and plunder of victory in the fields of France. The lucrative attractions of the chevauchee and levying the patis were now gone, leaving many returning soldiers frustrated and unemployed. There were no more fortunes to be made in France by the landed gentry and lessor nobles, as any potentially lucrative positions of adminsitration fell to the greatest ascendant nobles and those who enjoyed the King's favour. Many Lords were now seeking payments for their terms of indenture, as were their own men, whilst the Commons now attempted to persuade the King to Resume Crown lands for fear of further taxation. Preferring to spend his time with his new bride and enjoying this relative time of peace, Henry V had neither the time nor the inclination to attend to these matters of redress. Nevertheless, upon his death, and with an infant King on the throne, the support of Parliament became crucial to legitimize the Regency. The ensuing Parliamentary sessions were strained and the Council was reluctant, if not outright opposed, to agree to Resumption. The sessions were twice prorogued for weeks due to rioting in London and Kent, which were brutally put down. It was the first real test for a fragile Regency...

During the remainder of his reign, Henry V declined to call Parliament. After Henry's death and once the Regency had been established, a Parliament was finally called in order to address England's misgivings. The mood of the proceedings was mixed. The war in France had been costly. Retainers, households, troops and loans had to be paid. England's lords had found themselves hard pressed for repayment of Crown debts. The Lords understood that only the greatest among them, and even then only those select few enjoying the King's favour, would profit greatly from England's newly acquired possessions in France. In contrast to the discontent of the nobles, the Commons were emboldened and enthusiastic. The populace had endured harsh taxation throughout the long war with France, and most desired an end to the burden. Having bitterly fought for an Act of Resumption ever since Henry IV's days, the Commons now looked on the latest political development as a golden opportunity to push further still. The Council was in a difficult position and was hard pressed to come to a concensus and make a decision. The Commons expected the King to pay for the defense of England's continental possessions out of his newly acquired possessions in France, while the nobles coveted the nwe lucrative positions on the continent, and were demanding payment for services rendered. For the meantime, stability in France was threatening stability in England.

Within weeks of the treaty, Bedford was married to Anne of Burgundy while Arthur of Brittany, Earl of Richmond married Margaret of Burgundy. Perhaps more importantly, Burgundy and Brittany reaffirmed their commitments to the Treaty of Troyes, acknowledging Bedford as Regent of France. Thus the alliance between England, Burgundy and Brittany was reafirmed. Nevertheless, the stability as such was questionable, and neither leader trusted the other entirely. At the very least, Bedford was now free to persue the conquest of France without interference from Burgundy or Brittany. In England the Treaty of Amiens was celebrated as a token of Bedford's ability as Regent of France. Well done sire!

Such support was of incalculable value to the English. It meant that, where necessary, ducal pressure could be brought to bear upon individuals and corporations to accept the treaty's terms, and when Henry V died, it led to a more rapid and more general acceptance of his young son in Burgundian-controlled lands than might otherwise have been achieved. Such support would prove costly. The Burgundians were at pains to ensure payments were timely and in no short supply.

The Maid, now in the hands of her enemies, had compromised English claims since the Consecration. To reverse this, execution was insufficient. She had to be shown a heretic to undermine her alleged divine mission and thus strike at Charles' legitimacy. For that, the English still had a weapon in hand: the theologians of the University of Paris and a trial for witchcraft.

After months of investigation, trial, and infamies, and in spite of the attempts of Bishop of Beauvais, Cauchon, to avoid the execution, Joan was finally declared a witch. On May 14, 1431, she was burned alive in Rouen. However, the result did not meet the hopes of Bedford: the affair had been carried out so confusedly that even on the English side doubt appeared. As the Virgin was on her pyre in the old market, one Englishman exclaimed 'My God, we burned a saint...'
