During the siege he was wounded, and he died while his army was in retreat to Myanmar. King Hsinbyushin, third King (1763-76) of the Alaungpaya, or Konbaung, dynasty in Myanmar (Myanmar). He pursued a policy of expansion at the expense of practically all his neighbours. Hsinbyushin's most important single project was the subjugation of Siam (now Thailand). In 1764 he campaigned eastward, taking Chiang Mai (Chiengmai) and Vientiane before invading the Chao Phraya River valley. When the Siamese capital of Ayutthaya fell in April 1767, he deported thousands of prisoners to Myanmar. According to the Siamese chronicles, 'the King of Hanthawaddy (Bayinnaung) waged war like a monarch, but the King of Ava (Hsinbyushin) like a robber'.
