	#-#In the Feud of Soest that lasted from 1444 to 1449 the westphalian town of Soest, which was then among the biggest and richest cities of Germany, backed by Cologne's old enemy, the Duke of Kleve, managed to maintain its liberty against the claims of Archbishop Dietrich of Cologne. Like many other territorial princes of his time, the archbishop tried to consolidate his rule and to extend it according to the principles of roman law against the resistance of the Westphalian cities. A great part of former episcopal authority had been granted to the westphalian towns by incompetent archbishops, or outright assumed by the town councils. Thereby, so argumented the council of Soest, it became part of the town's liberty charter. The archbishop's desire to recover his old rights therefore seemed to be an attack on Soest's very existance. The town opposed these policies by accepting the Duke of Kleve and Mark as its new overlord on June 5th 1444. Kleve had been struggling for hegemony in the region with the colonian archbishops for a long time, and they took this chance to win a useful ally. The Duke confirmed Soest's privileges and granted new ones to them. This sparked a feud between the Archbishop and the Duke, which soon turned into major war with Burgundy, Münster, Osnabrück, Paderborn, Lippstadt, Hohenstein, Hoya and Lippe supporting Kleve and Bavaria, Saxony, Nassau and Brandenburg on Cologne's side. At the peak of the conflict, both factions fielded over 100000 soldiers. The possessions of Kleve and Cologne were severely devastated and depopulated. The turning point was when a bohemian mercenary army recruited by the Archbishop failed to take Soest and Lippstadt in 1447. Johann of Kleve, the son of the Duke who led the klevian army, then managed to convince the Bohemians to stop fighting. The feud ended with the decision of Pope Nicolas in favour of Kleve in 1449 that both sides had agreed to accept at a congress in Maastricht.

	#-#For years Europe has been preparing for the death of childless Carlos II of Spain. He was related to several royal families in Europe, but after the death of the designated heir, Joseph Ferdinand Wittelbach of Bavaria, at the age of six, the royal houses of Austria and France had a similar claim. But both were too powerful, and the addition of the Spanish empire would make any of them unstoppable, and so candidates not destined to their thrones, Philip of Anjou and Charles Habsburg, were discussed as heirs to Carlos, and several partition agreements were negotiated. That is precisely what everybody wanted to prevent in Spain. A will was redacted and the agonizing Carlos signed it. It left the Kingdom to Philip Anjou, but it contained two crucial clauses, the condition that the crowns of France and Spain should never be held by the same person and that the Spanish possessions could not be divided. Austria, of course, rejected it, but the rest of Europe seemed to agree, as the equilibrium was not broken. But Louis misjudged the uneasiness that the rest of Europe displayed for the French expansionism, and made several mistakes after the Spanish succession. He closed the Spanish-American commerce to the English and the Dutch, he recognized James III Stuart as King of England, and French troops occupied the fortresses in Spanish Netherlands. In February, the French States had ratified the right of Philip of Anjou to the crown of France, violating the will of Carlos II. The maritime powers had the motive and the excuse, and Austria discovered that now she had allies for the war of Spanish succession. The only allies of France were the Wittelsbach: the electors of Bavaria, Cologne and Trier, and the Duke of Savoy. Maximilian II of Bavaria had been named governor of the Spanish Netherlands. The Bavarian participation in the war lasted until the battle of Blenheim in 1704, when she was knocked out of the war by a crushing defeat. Colognes Archbishop was a Wittelsbach and the brother of the elector of Bavaria and aided his brother.
