	#-#The Czech priest and professor Jan Hus developed radical reformatory demands on the base of the teachings of John Wyclif. Despite a guarantee of safe-conduct by Emperor Sigismund, he was executed at the stake for heresy at the Council of Constance in 1415. This could however not stop the Hussite movement in Bohemia. Hus' followers were rapidly growing, and when King Vaclav IV of Bohemia died and his brother Sigismund, already Emperor and King of Hungary was to succeed him, they, unwilling to forgive him the betrayal of Hus and afraid that he would suppress them, refused to acknowledge him and gained control of most of Bohemia proper - while the lands of the Bohemian crown and the catholic part of Bohemia accepted Sigismund. Due to its radical anti-clerical and anti-feudal tendencies Hussitism posed a big threat to the church and nobility in the countries adjacent to Bohemia. Several German and European princes therefore decided to oppose the Hussites and to support Sigismund in his struggle with them that lasted for almost two decades. Should we decide to fight these heretics, we should be aware that this would be internationally regarded as an intervention in favour of Sigismund as rightful King of Bohemia rather than a war of conquest, and that therefore, if Sigismund prevails and manages to restore royal authority, we would be expected to turn over any conquests in Bohemia to the Kingdom of Bohemia.

	#-#A broken man, Vaclav IV died of a second stroke on August 16th 1419. His brother, Emperor Sigismund, immediately claimed the throne and was acknowledged as rightful heir by the crown lands and by the remaining catholics in Bohemia, mostly in the crown lands Moravia, Silesia and Lusatia where there still was a catholic majority, however the Hussites who at that time already dominated most of Bohemia proper refused to accept him, fearing suppression of their faith and despising him for his betrayal of Jan Hus that led to his execution at the stake in 1415. Armed resistance against royal authority and violence against Romanists, especially Germans, began almost immediately. Queen Sophia, widow of Vaclav, first acted as regent in Bohemia and tried to maintain at least a bit of central authority in Prague and to secure the throne for her brother-in-law, however she was opposed by the Hussites in Prague and had few effective control over Bohemia. On November 13th, she had to conclude a truce with thecitizens of Prague, having failed to suppress them with hired mercenaries, basically acknowledging that the Hussite movement had become impossible to control, let alone suppress it. For almost two decades large parts of Bohemia would be in Hussite hands.

The brutal internal war cost many lives and weakened the Hussites substantially. A decisive battle at Malesov on June 7th 1424 was won by the Hussites. As a consequence, the influence of the Taborites in Hussite Bohemia increased dramatically, which resulted in a radicalisation of the whole movement, a more hostile attitude towards Zikmund and his catholic supporters and a more offensive strategy.

The more radical members of the Hussite delegation, especially its leader Prokop Holý, and the unbending representants of the Roman Church who were reluctant to tolerate what they considered heresy however prevented an agreement. Thus the Hussite delegates returned to Bohemia in 1433, accompanied by a deputation of the Council. While the Taborites resumed the fighting and began to siege Plzen, the deputation of the council approached the leaders of the moderate Hussite nobles, called Utraquists. The Utraquists were hostile towards the radicality and the democratic tendencies of the Taborites and Orebites, hence a national diet sitting in Prague which was dominated by them agreed to the 'compactata', four articles that recognized the main demands of the Hussites in January 1434. This agreement was inacceptable to the Taborites and Orebites, and a civil war for power in Bohemia ensued. An army of the nobles commanded by Divis Borek z Miletinka met the army of Prokop Holý and Prokupek at Lipany near Prague on May 30th 1434. The Utraquists were numerically superior and had a skillful commander in Borek, hence when the Taborite cavalry under Capek ze San fled the battlefield, possibly deliberately betraying their side, the fate of the Taborites and Orebites was sealed. The Utraquist heavy horse annihilated them almost to the last man, and almost all their leaders including the two Prokops were killed. This battle basically eliminated the radical Hussites as a political force in Bohemia and opened up the way for a settlement between the moderates and Sigismund. However had the cavalry not fled, this could have become Prokop's greatest victory and allowed his followers to take control of Bohemia and keep on defying the church and Sigismund...

Albeit militarily successful against King Zikmund's and the Church's attempts to subdue them by force, Bohemia is now threatening to fall into anarchy. At this point, the most charismatic figure of the Utraquist faction, Jiri z Podiebrad, decides that Bohemia and his confession can only be saved if he manages to get himself elected King and take up the reins of government. While the idea of establishing a national dynasty on the Bohemian throne is quite popular, it also meets strong resistance: lots of Utraquists would hate to see their power limited by a new King, and thus prefer turning Bohemia into an aristocratic republic with almost non-existant central authority.
