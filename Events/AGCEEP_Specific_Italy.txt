	#-#After the first successful Italian campaign with the battle of Lodi in 1796, General Napoléon Bonaparte proceeded to organize two states in Northern Italy: one on the south of the Po River, the Cispadane Republic, and one on the north, the Transpadane Republic. These two were successively merged into the Cisalpine Republic on 29 June 1797 with the capital in Milan. The Cisalpine Republic consisted of roughly the former Duchy of Milan, those portions of the Republic of Venice west of the Adige River, the Duchy of Modena, the Papal Legations, the Piedmontese province of Novara, west of Ticino River and the Valtellina. But The Republic would have dissolved after the defeats of France against the Second Coalition in 1799 occupied by Austro-Russian forces. Only in 1800 in the second Italian campaign after the Battle of Marengo First Consul Napoléon Bonaparte retook the territories which this time were extended to the former Austrian lands of the Veneto and the Papal Legations. In January 1802, the Cisalpine Republic changed its name to Italian Republic with Napoléon Bonaparte as its president.

The 'Corona Ferrea' or the 'Iron Crown of the Lombards' (still nowadays kept in Monza's Dome, a city near Milan) so called from a narrow band of iron within it, said to be beaten out of one of the nails used at the Crucifixion, was worn for the last time in history by Charles V of Habsburg when he was crowned Holy Roman Emperor and King of Italy by the Pope Clemens VII at Bologna in 1530. On 26 May 1805 in a ceremony arranged in Milan's Dome Napoléon crowned himself King of Italy and said the ritual words: 'God gave it to me, woe to him who touches it'. These were the words spoken for the first time by Charlemagne when he received the crown as King of the Lombards in 774.
