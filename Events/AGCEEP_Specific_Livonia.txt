This vassalage brought Poland into conflict with Russia, allied with Denmark and started the 1563-1570 War of the Three Crowns against Sweden. At the 1582 armistice of Jan Zapolski, Russia was beaten, gave up Livland and Polotsk and Sweden won the Baltic province of Estland while Livland and Kurland remained under Polish control. We may transform into Kurland and give Livland and Estland away in any of the two agreements, or we may revert to Catholicism and again grab the Armed Glove of the True Faith.
