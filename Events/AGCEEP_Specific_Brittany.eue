However, Anne made public her distaste for the union and in so doing had alienated De Rieux and D'Albret. Thus, the Duchess favoured Count Dunois and her Chancellor, Philip de Montauban.

To complicate matters, Anne had received overtures from several other realms in Europe. The King of England, Henry VII, had proposed the 11 year old Duke of Buckingham as a suitor for Anne.

	#-#Anne of Brittany, the daughter of Duke François II of Brittany, was heiress to his duchy. Shortly before her father's death (1488), a French army under Louis de La Trémoille successfully invaded Brittany and secured the duke's promise that Anne would marry only with the consent of the French crown. Upon becoming duchess, the young Anne's hand and her duchy were eagerly sought. To prevent France from swallowing up the duchy, a coalition including Archduke Maximilian of Austria, King Henry VII of England, and King Ferdinand II of Aragón sent forces to Anne's aid. Nevertheless, Anne's situation was perilous and she appealed (1489) directly to Maximilian for protection. In 1490, Maximilian married Anne by proxy but failed to assist her with armed strength. Besieged at Rennes in 1491, Anne was forced by the French to annul her marriage and was quickly married to Charles VIII. It was agreed that if Charles died before Anne without issue, she was to marry his successor. Accordingly, in 1499, she married Louis XII, who had previously obtained a divorce from his first wife. The marriage (1514) of Claude, Anne's daughter by Louis XII, to François of Angoulême (later François Ier of France) led to the eventual incorporation (1532) by France of Brittany, which had previously remained theoretically separate.
