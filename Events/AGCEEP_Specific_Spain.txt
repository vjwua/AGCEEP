	#-#In 1469 Alfonso V of Portugal was presented with the opportunity of becoming the King of Castile when he and his brother-in-law Enrique IV of Castile agreed on his marriage to Isabel, Princess of Asturias (heir title). But the deal failed when Isabel married Fernando of Aragon. When Enrique died and Isabel proclaimed herself Queen, in 1475, he saw his chance disappearing and decided to play hard. In a month he was married to his niece, Juana, and had claimed the crown of Castile for himself, invading the country. The plan was good because Juana had also the support of France and a great part of the Castilian nobility who rebelled in her support. Despite the simultaneous invasion from France and Portugal, and the rebellion of the nobles in the West of Castile, the war did not go well. The French were stopped by the Basques, while Fernando, with troops mostly from Castile and Asturias, inflicted a crushing defeat to the Portuguese in Toro in 1476. Alfonso traveled to France to try to get a stronger involvement from Louis XI, but the French had lost interest. By then Fernando had recovered control of all the Northwest. The war at sea, that extended as far as the coast of Guinea, claimed by Castile, was also favorable to Isabel. Alfonso's marriage to his niece was not recognized by the Pope, and a last invasion at the South ended also in defeat at la Albuera in February, 1479. With the nobility subdued and the Portuguese defeated, Castile had now the upper hand, but Isabel was half Portuguese herself, and Portuguese was her first language. She desired a perpetual peace with Portugal, with long lasting friendship and perhaps a dynastic union in the future, like the one with Aragon, and she was prepared to be generous with the defeated to obtain it. The treaty of Alcacovas, was concluded in September 4, 1479. It had four parts, all of them historically important. In the first part, Isabel and Fernando were recognized as rightful Kings of Castile and Leon, and Alfonso was recognized as rightful King of Portugal. In the second part, Juana renounced to her claim to the crown of Castile and was forced to expend the rest of her life in a convent in Portugal. In the third part, the future marriage between the infant Alfonso, son of Joao and the infant Isabel, daughter of the Catholic Kings was arranged. And in the fourth part, Castile accepted the claim of Portugal over Guinea, and the Atlantic coast of Africa, Madeira, Azores and Cape Verde, and any future discoveries South of the Canary Islands toward Guinea. Portugal accepted the claim of Castile over the Canary Islands. The treaty of Alcacovas is very important because it created a long lasting peace between Portugal and Spain, and set the basis for future diplomatic resolution of conflicts, like the discovery of the New World and the treaty of Tordesillas. Some believe it was crucial to the discovery of the New World by Spain, as Africa was reserved for Portugal, leaving only the unknown West for Sp

The Kings gave orders of holding Alhama at all cost, as the first step in the conquest of the Nasrid emirate. Alhama held thanks to the help of the Duke of Medina-Sidonia, personal enemy of the Marquis of Cadiz, a clear demonstration that the war was going to unite the Kingdoms. At the beginning of the war, the Christians were not prepared for the offensive, and suffered several setbacks, but Granada was in a civil war, divided in two factions fighting each other and against the Christians, and after the battle of Lucena, the leader of one faction, Boabdil, was captured. Fernando decided to realease him on terms to keep the Muslims divided. Fernando reorganized the army, introducing artillery in great amounts, as a new weapon to conquer the Muslim strongholds in days instead of months. Through an extraordinary effort during the campaigns of 1484-86 the first phase of the war was concluded with the conquest of the Western part of the emirate of Granada, capturing Boabdil a second time. The pact made with him for his release included his renounciation to the parts of the emirate in the hands of his rival and uncle, Emir Muhammad XIII al-Zagal, and the surrender of Granada once it became under his control in exchange for a title and land states. The second phase of the war of Granada was then directed against the parts controlled by al-Zagal, the coast and the Eastern part of the emirate. After the fall of Baza and Almeria in 1489, Al-Zagal, defeated, abdicated, and Boabdil became in control of Granada. According to the treaty the war was over. But Boabdil refused to comply, forcing a third phase, the siege of Granada, that was stablished in 1491. The artillery was not used to preserve the city, and Granada will finally surrender in January 1492. 780 years of Muslim presence in the peninsula had come to an end.

Columbus was basing his plan in the mistaken Ptolemaic and Biblic theories of Pierre D'Ailly and Paolo Toscanelli that considered the circumference of the Earth a lot smaller that it really is. Although it was difficult to find good geographers in Castile, the Spanish commission also rightly concluded that the plan was inviable, probably because the right measurement of the Earth's circumference had already been calculated by Erathostenes, and by Muslim astronomers, and this knowledge was known at the time. The outrageous demands of the sailor probably did not help him either. However, since Columbus had already gained some important supporters, Queen Isabel between them, the commission left the door open to a reconsideration after the war of Granada, and allocated some funds for Columbus.

Knowing that, almost all the Guanches had baptized, yet their lords sometimes sold them anyway despite priests protests. The authority of the Peraza in Gomera had been established through a tribal pact with two of the four tribal groups. When Hernán became the lover of Yballa, a young Guanche, he inadvertently broke a tabu, since she was a member of his adopted tribal group, and intermarriage within a group was not allowed to prevent consanguinity. Hernán de Peraza was killed, and the natives rose in rebellion, besieging his wife, who called for help.

From the moment of their conquest, sugar was introduced in the islands, specially in Gran Canaria, Gomera, La Palma and Tenerife.

Fernando reorganized the army, introducing artillery in great amounts, as a new weapon to conquer the Muslim strongholds in days instead of months. Through an extraordinary effort during the campaigns of 1484-86 the first phase of the war was concluded with the conquest of the Western part of the emirate of Granada, capturing Boabdil a second time. The pact made with him for his release included his renounciation to the parts of the emirate in the hands of his rival and uncle, Emir Muhammad XIII al-Zagal, and the surrender of Granada once it became under his control in exchange for a title and land states. The second phase of the war of Granada was then directed against the parts controlled by al-Zagal, the coast and the Eastern part of the emirate. After the fall of Baza and Almeria in 1489, Al-Zagal, defeated, abdicated, and Boabdil became in control of Granada. According to the treaty the war was over. But Boabdil refused to comply, forcing a third phase, the siege of Granada, that was stablished in 1491. The artillery was not used to preserve the city, and Granada will finally surrender in January 1492. 780 years of Muslim presence in the peninsula had come to an end.

	#-#Cristoforo Colombo submitted his plan for finding a Western route to India a second time in 1491. He was made to wait until the fall of Granada, but then the commission failed against his plan for a second time. However Columbus had impressed favourably several counselors of both Isabel and Fernando, and they lobbied in his favor. The main argument was that even if the risk was high, the investment was small and the potential benefits enormous, both in terms of money and in terms of souls that could be saved by Christianity. Isabel was very sensitive to this last argument and agreed to finance the expedition. The monarchs agreed to the exorbitant terms Columbus demanded: he would be knighted if he were to succeed on his first voyage, appointed Admiral of the Seas, made Viceroy of all the new lands, and on top of that awarded 10 percent of any new wealth. After 10 years of pursuing his dream he would accept nothing less, and after all, the enterprise was considered unlikely to produce much. The expedition was not expensive to finance, and the Queen did not need to sell any of her jewels. It is interesting to think that the most important geographical discovery of mankind was serendipitous. It came out of a grant application that was rejected by a scientific commission based on solid evidence that it was flawed and ignored relevant accepted bibliography supporting the opposite rightful theory, that India could not be reached by sailing Westward across an empty sea with available naval technology, but whose decision was overruled due to favoritism by influential politicians. Columbus will always defend against all evidence that he had reached Asia and not a New World. Awful administrator, he was, however, one of the greatest sailors of all times.

	#-#Hernando Cortes expedition was intended to collect tributes and gather information only, as Diego Velazquez was the -adelantado-, with a royal charter to take possession of new lands. But Cortes was going to seize his chance. In the Mexica lands, the Aztec Tlatoani, or Prime Speaker, Motehcuzoma Xocoyotzin (Angry Lord, Junior) had initiated a power concentration process, effectively becoming an emperor of the triple alliance and imposing the supremacy of Tenochtitlan over Texcoco and Tlacopan, and at the same time expanding the borders of the Aztec Empire. Due to his despotic nature he was impopular, but he was also superstitious. He identified certain signs and the presence of the strange men in the coasts, as the predicted return of the expelled god Quetzalcoatl to reclaim his Kingdom. It was unthinkable to receive the mighty Plumed Serpent with hostility, and Motehcuzoma sent great presents to the conquistadores and requested them not to come to Tenochtitlan. By stimulating their greed, his effect was obviously the opposite, and Cortes skillfully obtained from his men the formal request to direct them in a quest for gold, and they promised him 20 percent of the benefits, after the royal 20 percent was deducted. Cortes founded Veracruz, sent an envoy to the King of Spain with letters, and burnt the ships to prevent the men loyal to Diego Velazquez from returning to Cuba with the news that Cortes had stepped to the other side of the law. Now only the triumph could save him. With 1300 Totonacas allies from Cempoala, the 400 Spaniards interned into the jungle, towards Tlaxcala, a nation subjugated by the Aztecs that could be gained to their side, according to the Totonacas. The Tlaxcalans were divided, but the faction hostile to the Spaniards was defeated in battle, and several thousand Tlaxcalan warriors joined Cortes side. The Spaniards were applying the tactics learned at the war of Granada, use the divisions within the enemy to their favor, and capture the enemy leader, deciding later if it was more advantageous to release him, to keep him prisoner, or simply to kill him. The Indians, weakened by the European diseases and bitterly divided, facilitated the conquest of great empires by very few men in what constitutes one of the most amazing pages of history. After a stop at the ceremonial center of Cholula, where a terrible massacre took place, because the Tlaxcalans had several accounts to settle, the capital of the Empire, bigger than any European city of the time, awaited.

The Spaniards were horrified by the volume of the human sacrifices of the Aztecs, and overcome by greed over so much gold. Cortes demands on Motehcuzoma to abandon his pagan gods weakened his position as a god himself. Aware of his precarious position Cortes captured Motehcuzoma, but when news arrived that Panfilo de Narvaez had been sent by Diego Velazquez to capture him, he left Pedro de Alvarado in charge and went back with 80 men to Cempoala, where he half-defeated, half-convinced Narvaez army of 1500 men to join him, and then returned to Tenochtitlan with additional Tlaxcalan reinforcements. But in his absence Alvarado had managed to massacre half of the notables of the city, triggering a rebellion. Cortes exhorted Motehcuzoma to appease his subjects, but these killed him out of rage for being on the Spaniards side. Cortes understood that they had to retreat to Tlaxcala, but the secret nightly escape was discovered and 800 Spaniards and 5,000 Indian allies were killed, while the rest narrowly escaped, Cortes losing two fingers, in what was to be known as the Noche Triste (Sad Night), June 30, 1520. The time for diplomacy was gone. For a year Cortes sought new allies and reorganized and trained a new army, building ships to be transported and mounted in the lake, to siege and attack the water surrounded city, and in June 1521 he was back. In a month and a half the resistance was overcome, the city demolished, and the Empire won. Except for some guerrilla fighting in the mountains, the Aztecs bowed to their new master. When the Consejo de Indias learned of the conquest of the immensely rich empire, they dismissed Diego de Velazquez charges against Cortes.

	#-#The Mesta was an association of sheepholders created in Castile in 1273 by Alfonso X the Wise. Its origen was the use of lands near the borders with the Muslims during the Reconquista, as no crops could be grown due to constant hostilities, while sheep flocks could easily be hidden during the algaradas or Muslim attacks. The substitution of the original Churra race of sheeps by the higher quality Merina, introduced in Spain by the Marinid berbers, increased the wealth of the Mesta and the Crown income, and the Kings started a policy of protecting the Mesta at the expense of agriculture and forests. Sheep flocks in Central Spain required summer and winter pastures and free routes between them, and the Mesta herds had the right to drink from any water and eat from any land, paying for that priviledge a quantity decided by the Mesta. They could also cut forests, and no land could be fenced along their routes. This policy reached its peak with the Catholic Kings, when the oldest member of the Royal Council became also the president of the Mesta Council, and when the regulations of 1492 were stablished. The taxes over the rights of pass were reduced, but they were shifted from the local towns directly to the Crown. By then the Mesta controlled 125,000 km of routes and half a million hectares (over a million acres) of productive lands. It had its own judicial system and its own law enforcement agents and was perhaps the most important corporate organization in Medioeval Europe. As is the case with other nomad populations, the shephards of the Mesta were the best soldiers of Spain and constituted the main source of recruits for the elite Tercios. The Mesta was for a long time the main source of wealth for Castile, as its precious wool was exported to the North of Europe, but some consequences could not be foreseen, and the production of cereals started to decline. The Honorable Council of the Mesta will last until 1836, and even today many Mesta routes are protected forever from urban development to be enjoyed no longer by sheeps, but by weekend excursionists. As a curiosity, the word mustang derives from mesteño, or mesta animal.

	#-#Medieval Spain was unique in Western Europe for the diversity of its population. In addition to a large segment of Muslims, Spain had the single largest Jewish community in the world, with three hundred thousand souls. In the 14th Century, however, anti-Jewish attitudes were on the rise throughout Europe. In 1290, England expelled its Jews and France followed in 1306. Spain began to experience an increasing anti-Jewish sentiment. It exploded in the summer of 1391 with angry anti-Jewish riots with hundreds of deaths. These riots led to major forced conversions of Jews to Christianity. Unlike the remaining Jews, the converts were welcomed into a full participation in Spanish society and they would soon become leaders in government, science, business and the Church. Over the years the Old Christians saw these converted families as opportunists who secretly maintained the faith of their forefathers. It was a strong mixture of racial prejudice and jealousy against the converts that would stir-up the Spanish Inquisition to prosecute the minority of false-converts. On March 31, 1492, Isabel and Fernando signed the edict of expulsion of all Jews in their Kingdoms by July 31. They were allowed to sell their properties and take their valuables, and money in letters of payment, but no gold or silver. The Kings intended to force the conversion of most of them, and indeed many converted, raising the proportion of Jews converted along the century to two thirds of their original population. But many also chose to leave, their numbers still debated, but probably over 100,000, most of them from Castilla, Toledo, Andalucia, and Murcia. It was a popular measure probably intended to forge a national identity for Spain, and also due to the belief that the Jews were a bad influence to the converts. The Jews that went to Portugal, Navarra, Provence and Morocco, suffered prosecution, violence and new expulsions, and the Kings of Spain allowed the return of those willing to convert until 1499. Those that went to Italy and Constantinople fared better. The economic consequences of the expulsion were negative as the Jews paid increased taxes, lent money to Kings and nobles, and administered properties. Culturally it was an even greater loss.

No less than eleven editions were published in 1493! They were issued across western Europe, in Spain, Italy, France, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. Six more editions were published in 1494-97. Everybody was eager to learn about the new lands across the sea, and the letters of Columbus and Amerigo Vespucci, the 1516 'De orbe novo decades' of Pedro Mártir de Anglería, and the 1535 'Historia general de las Indias' of Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo, contributed to change the perception of the world that Europe had. But more profound changes were about to come. Already Columbus brought a pineapple to King Fernando in his first voyage, and they would be followed by maize and potatoes, that with a caloric yield per cultivated surface double to that of wheat, would trigger an unprecedented population growth. The Columbian exchange drastically altered both worlds, but at the time it also greatly contributed to the prestige of the Spanish monarchy, that after unifying two powerful countries, and expelling the Muslims from Western Europe, had discovered a New World.

	#-#On his first voyage, Columbus reached the Great Antilles, discovering Cuba and la Hispaniola (divided today in Haiti and Dominican Republic), were the natives were amiables. On December 24, 1492, his biggest ship, la Santa Maria, suffered damages beyond repair in la Hispaniola. Since there was not enough room for everybody to return, they constructed a fort with the ship's wood, called Fort Christmas, and forty men were left behind, with the promise of returning the following year. Columbus took some indians with him, together with fruits, plants, parrots, and gold. But another less innocuous exchange was taking place. The Europeans took with them smallpox and typhus to the New World, and from then on, wherever they went the plagues preceded them. About 50 percent of the natives in the New World died in the following decades, and possibly only 20 percent of the original population levels remained a century later. All the plagues suffered by Europe since the middle ages, concentrated in a single deathly wave that swept the entire continent. In exchange the Europeans brought a new disease to the Old World, syphilis. No women were allowed in the first expedition, and clearly Columbus sailors did not remain idle. Introduced by the Spanish sailors in Seville and Naples, the disease would be spread throughout Italy and the rest of Europe by the French armies of Charles VIII in his failed attempt to conquer Naples, being known in those days as the French disease. Columbus remained ignorant of having changed the history of mankind, and thinking only that he had found a better way to reach India, in his second voyage, he will command a big fleet with enough colonists, farm animals, seeds, and priests to establish a colony in la Hispaniola (Barahona and Tortuga). The first permanent European colony in the New World.

But Christopher and his brothers Diego and Bartolome were very bad administrators and were distrusted by the Spaniards for being foreigners. Quarrels and rebellions abounded, and by 1495 everybody in the colony wanted to return to Spain. The colony was a sink for money, and Columbus, aware that his promises of riches to the Kings have not been fulfilled, insisted in slaving natives and sending them to Seville. This was a legitimate trade for a Genoese, but the Kings influenced by the church had given orders that only natives that raised in arms against Spanish rule could be enslaved. Worried by all this problems, the Kings named Francisco Bobadilla new governor of La Hispaniola in 1500, but he went as far as to put Columbus in chains and send him back to Spain. The Kings, horrified, released him, and named Fray Nicolas de Ovando new governor. Ovando ruthlessly suppressed every rebellion from colonists and natives, killing all the indian caciques (chieftains). He then efficiently administrated the colony, reducing the crown tax to 20 percent, stimulating the productivity and attracting new colonists. Soon the colonist population soared and the island became a good source of income for Spain, and the base for the conquest of the neighboring island of Cuba (Havana, Moron and Guantanamo). By contrast the native population, decimated by diseases and having lost the will to live under European oppression, initiated a decline that will end in their extinction. In 1507, Fernando el Catolico will name Diego Colon, son of Christopher Columbus, new governor of La Hispaniola, in substitution of Ovando.

From there he took the expedition that discovered the Pacific Ocean in 1513. Balboa was popular, but run into problems with the authorities for expelling the inefficient Major of the city. A new administrator was sent from Spain, Pedro Arias de Avila, a 70 year old veteran commander in the wars of Granada and Africa. Cruel and unscrupulous, he was jealous of Balboa and although initially forced to declare him innocent, he would later bring him again to trial, and without possibility of defense or appeal, condem him and have him executed. The authorities were displeased and named a new governor, but he died on the same day he arrived. Since the living conditions in the Gulf of Darien region were appalling, and the diseases made prey on the colonists, Pedro Arias founded in 1519 the city of Panama, the first port in the Pacific, and moved there the capital in 1524. The colonists of Isthmus had received tales of a fabulous country towards the South, named Biru, with cities made of gold. Two adventurers, Francisco Pizarro and Diego Almagro made plans for the conquest of such place, sailing South from Panama. Pedro Arias bought a share in the society, but having lost confidence in the expedition, due to the initial failures, he sold his part in 1526. The same year he was finally deposed.

	#-#On November 26, 1504 Isabel died, after leaving the Kingdom to her daughter Juana, but entrusting the government to her husband Fernando in case she was incapacitated, as she showed mental instability. The Kingdom got split between partisans and opponents of Fernando. The King of Aragon decided to leave Castile, even though the new Kings, Felipe I and Juana, had not arrived yet from Flanders. But when Felipe died soon after his arrival, Cisneros became the Regent of Castile with the goal of obtaining the return of the King. Fernando, King of Aragon, became then Regent of Castile in the name of his now mad daughter, and rewarded Cisneros with the Cardinalate. In her testament, Isabel had asked her heirs not to abandon the conquest of Africa. The Kings of Castile had reclaimed their right to the integration of Mauritania Tingitana (then Fez and Tlemcen) since Alfonso XI because it was part of the Hispanian diocese, and Tangier had been a Visigothic province. Already Melilla had been occupied by the Duke of Medina-Sidonia in 1497. The question was if embarked as she was in the conquest of America and Italy, Spain could afford to conquer also North Africa. Cisneros wanted to pursue Isabel's wishes, while Fernando was more practical.

His motivation was the security of his Italian possessions from Barbary attacks. The Spanish expedition, with the costs advanced by Cisneros and under naval command of Ramón de Cardona, and land command of the Alcaide de los Donceles captured the fortress after a heavy bombardment. But Mazalquivir was difficult to hold, as it lacked water and had to be provisioned by dangerous sorties or by friendly tribes. After the return of Fernando, Cisneros lobbied indefatigably for another expedition to Oran. Fernando, who owned his post as Regent of Castile to him, agreed when Cisneros offered to finance the expedition. Command of the expedition was entrusted to Pedro Navarro, and it was carried out under the direct supervision of Cisneros, and under his personal banner. The Spaniards landed an army of over 20,000 men and besieged the city. Navarro soon blew the walls with his mines and heavy artillery bombardment, and in the assault the Spaniards inflicted 4000 casualties in the enemy, and conquered the city. Cisneros wanted to push the conquest inland, but Navarro, under orders from the King, refused. For almost 300 years, Oran and Mazalquivir would remain in Spanish hands.

However the conquest of isolated presidios (fortresses) in the coast had the exact opposite effect. Under the pressure of Spain, the authority of the Zayyanid rulers of Tlemcen was weakened, and pirates became independent and more active all along the coast. A Turkish pirate of name Aruj, who had become famous, received permission from the Hafsid sultan of Tunis to use the island of Djerba (Gelves) as a base, and he captured Jijelli in 1514 and took over Algiers in 1516 when he defeated the Spaniards. He then killed the local ruler and proclaimed himself sultan. He was known as Baba Aruj, or father Aruj. This was translated by the Spaniards as Barbarroja (Barbarossa in Italian, or Red beard). He became the nightmare of the Spaniards. In 1517 he supported a rebellion in Tlemcen, taking over it, but he was driven out by the Spaniards and killed in 1518. However the balance of power in Tlemcen was shifting towards Algiers, that continued independent under the leadership of Aruj's brother, Khayr ad-Din Barbarossa, who sought the help of the Ottoman Empire.

	#-#Spain was the first nation in the world to create a permanent specific naval infantry unit in 1537. This was the Old Company of the Sea of Naples composed by harquebusiers to fight on board of galleys. In the winter of 1564, spies informed of a powerful Ottoman fleet being readied in Constantinople. On May 18, 1565 their target is revealed when the Janissaries land in Malta. Already two weeks before, Álvaro de Bazán had gone from the strait to Barcelona to embark 4,000 soldiers. The Mediterranean galleys of Gil de Andrade joined him at Palamós, and 1.500 more soldiers were embarked in Genoa. On July 20, they arrived to Naples to embark more forces, and they were in Messina on August 5, for the final assembly with further auxiliary forces. Finally on August 25, the Viceroy of Sicily, García de Toledo, gave the order to depart, arriving to Malta on September 7, forcing the Ottomans to lift their siege on the exact same day they had scheduled their final full out assault on the few defenders left alive. Had they arrived one day later, Malta would have been lost. It was clear to Felipe II that a reaction time of four months was not acceptable, and that Spain could not project her power far away unless a permanent army capable of landing and conducting battles was assigned to the Navy and could be quickly deployed. So in February 1566 he created the Tercio de la Armada del Mar Oceano, or Tercio of the Navy of the Ocean Sea, also known as Tercio de Figueroa for his first Field Marshal, and formed by 6,700 soldiers. harquebusiers from this unit were the first to assault the Sultana, the Ottoman flagship, in the battle of Lepanto, and as a reward, its commander Lope de Figueroa was given the commission to inform the King of the victory.

The Ottomans were calling to the doors of Vienna, and in Africa they had taken over Egypt, and with the help of the Barbary pirates, they were taking over Kingdom after Kingdom, destroying the policy of alliances that his grandfather Fernando had established. He could not let them reach the strait of Gibraltar. Worse still, they entered an alliance with France, so he was facing a simultaneous war in all fronts. To add to that, the Spanish presidios (fortresses) in Africa were very difficult to defend. When Barbarossa conquered Tunis in 1534, the fleeing Pasha al-Hassan went to the Spanish court and asked for help in exchange for vassalage. Carlos could not let the Ottomans or their allies come any closer to Spain and Italy. A huge armada was assembled and he decided to lead it in person.

The new Governor of Oran, Martín Alonso de Cordoba, the Count of Alcaudete, was ordered to lead an expedition against Tlemcen, that was shifting towards the Ottoman side. At Prevesa, in the Albanian coast, the combined fleets of Spain, Venice, Genoa and Papal States under command of imperial admiral Andrea Doria, were defeated by the Ottoman-Barbary fleet under Khayr ad-Din Barbarossa. Although loses were small and mostly Venetian, since Doria refused to fight, its effect was to give supremacy in the Eastern Mediterranean to the Ottomans. Besides the expedition of Alcaudete, something needed to be done to maintain Spanish supremacy, at least in the Western Mediterranean, and so Carlos ordered a naval expedition against Al-Djazaîr (Algiers).

The victory was very important because it put a clear limit to how far would the Ottoman Empire capable of projecting his power. However the Ottoman Empire was at his peak, as the capture of Tunis in 1569 demonstrated. The capture of Cyprus in 1571, triggered the formation of a Holy League, mainly formed by Spain, Venice and Papal States, with the combined fleet under command of Don Juan de Austria. The interests of Venice and Spain were very different: Venice wanted to recover Cyprus, and Spain wanted to recover her North African presidios, and they could only agree in fighting the Ottoman navy. The ensuing battle at Lepanto was the biggest naval battle in modern times with over 32,000 casualties (by comparison Trafalgar had only 3,000), 25,000 of them in the Ottoman side. The Ottoman fleet was almost completely destroyed. News of the victory were extremely well received by the Christians that suffered the Ottoman and Barbary piracy. Although the Ottomans rebuilt their fleet and recaptured Tunis a second time in 1574, their naval supremacy in the Mediterranean was destroyed forever.

In 1563, after the failure of Medinaceli in Tripoli, and the loss of Djerba, where Dragut made a pyramid with the skulls of the garrison, the Beylerbey Hassan Pasha, son of Barbarossa, decided to attack Oran. The Ottoman fleet had 32 galleys and 3 French round ships. The army was constituted of 1,000 Spahis, 15,000 Janissaries, and over 12,000 Kabyles and Arabs, contributed by the Sultan of Koukou and the Banu-Abba tribe. The assaults started in April on Mazalquivir, defended by Martín de Córdoba and 200 men. Time after time the Muslims were repelled. The son of the Sultan of Koukou died, Hassan was wounded, but their troops reached the walls of the fortification. On the last assault, on June 7, Martín was also wounded. Then news arrived that a powerful Christian fleet under command of Gian Andrea Doria and Francisco de Mendoza was on its way. Hassan Pasha called for an all out assault, but the Janissaries refused, and he had to escape, leaving behind all his artillery, and having lost 4,000 men, four galleys and the three French transports. Only 130 survivors remained in Mazalquivir. Maintenance of Oran, however, was becoming a burden. The Council of State asked for reports to study the possibility of leaving Oran and keeping only Mazalquivir, but without the first, the second was untenable, and so it was decided in 1574 to keep both. A great investment was made to upgrade the fortifications, designed by Antonelli, and the castle of Santa Cruz was built in 1577.

With great effort, the Moriscos rebellion was put down, and the Ottoman fleet defeated at Lepanto. But although Tunis was briefly recovered, it was quickly lost again due to lack of resources. But he was not alone in having problems. The Ottomans defeated at Malta and Lepanto found themselves also overstretched due to their taxing conflicts in Persia. Under these circumstances, Felipe II and Murad III negotiated a series of truces between 1577 and 1581. In these truces Felipe II renounced to Spanish former conquests in North Africa, while the Ottoman sultan renounced to Oran, and to lend help to the Moriscos. The peace between Spain and the Ottoman empire would be permanent, and would allow both empires to abandon the Mediterranean, that was left in the hands of the Barbary pirates, periodically checked by the European navies.

	#-#The presence of Charles VIII of France in the Kingdom of Naples scared the Italian princes, who had in a certain way permitted the French King to achieve his goal of settling there almost undisturbed. Venice and Florence were worried about a French hegemony in the peninsula. French military presence wasn't limited to Southern Italy but also to villages of Tuscany and the Papal States, which previously surrendered to Charles VIII in his march towards Naples, strategically located to grant the French military supply line. The Pope, who previously granted the French King military access through the Papal territories and consented his stay in Rome, felt in jeopardy as much as to refuse Charles VIII being proclaimed King of Naples. Also King Ferdinand of Aragon couldn't accept the French presence in a Kingdom where he instead, in spite of Alfons V's testament which assigned Naples to the other Trastamara branch, could be the one to have claims there. The position of Naples was also important for the Aragonese trading in the Mediterranean. The Duke of Milan, who decisively affected Charles VIII's decision to settle in Naples, was now alarmed by the presence of French reserve troops deployed in the county of Asti, very close to Milan and at the order of the Duke of Orléans, who had dynastical claims to the Milanese throne. So Venice, Milan, the Pope, Spain and even the Holy Roman Empire (so firmly opposed to the French expansionism in Italy as to join any Anti-French alliance available) consequently formed the Anti-French league in Venice on 31 March 1495. Florence preferred to stay out because of her internal problems caused by Charles VIII's passage and decided to support France instead. Having heard about those arrangements and fearing that the confederates would isolate his army in Italy, Charles VIII decided to return to France for reinforcements leaving his regent in Naples. He had to move his army quickly through the Apennines as to reach the Alps and then safety, but the presence of heavy artilleries and carriages transporting the big loot he accumulated across Italy, slowed his march down. Only at Fornovo on the Taro River, in the Po Valley, Charles VIII finally faced the army of the confederates. Despite having lost all the carriages, he managed to reach the Alps gaining from his expedition to Italy nothing but his army decimated by epidemies.

Starting from his base in Messina he then tried to reconquer his Kingdom with an Aragonese army led by general Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba. After an initial defeat against the French in the battle of Seminara, the King organized a fleet and, supported by the local population which was hostile to the presence of French troops, entered Naples retaking the castles which were still in French hands. Although having successfully helped his cousin Ferrandino, Ferdinand of Aragon distrusted Ferrandino's uncle Federico who succeded to the throne because of lack of Ferrandino's direct descendancy. Federico was a weak monarch whose unhappy diplomatic moves to appease France, even acknowledging his realm as a French fief, and to encourage diplomatic relations with the Turk would let the Kingdom be prey of foreign powers. Ferdinand of Aragon, who didn't deny to disconfess Alfons V's testament to keep the crown of Naples separate from those of Aragon and Sicily, feared that the defense of Naples, crucial to the Aragonese trading in the Mediterranean, could no longer be entrusted to his relative. He had to face the difficult choice of either going to war against France or splitting the Kingdom of Naples with them. When Federico refused a marriage between his son Ferrandino, Duke of Calabria, and Ferdinand's niece, Juana de Aragón, King Ferdinand definitively resolved to come to terms with the French King signing the treaty of Granada. The fate of Naples was then written.

At the treaty of Pamplona-Medina del Campo in January 1494, Jean and Catherine accepted the marriage of their heir to the heir of Spain, and the continuation of the Castilian protectorate. This allowed them to defeat Jean of Foix-Narbonne, who renounced to his claim to the crown of Navarre in 1497. But the confrontation between Spain and France that was starting in Italy left no room for a neutral Navarre. Strategically, Navarre could be used as a backdoor to invade the neighboring country, allowing the armies to cross the Pyrenees unmolested. A war between France and Spain over Navarre was in the horizon. This time Navarre seemed to tilt towards Spain.

The Beaumonts supported the invasion, and surrendered Pamplona to the Old Duke of Alba. The Gramonts were quickly overrun. The French armies under command of the Dauphin made numerous mistakes, ignoring the requests of Jean d'Albret, using the Navarrans and Gascoigners to lead the assaults and abusing the local population. The siege of Pamplona was a complete failure, and with the arrival of the winter they suffered grave loses, retreating back to France in a difficult march across the Pyrenees. By the spring of 1513, the Spaniards had resisted the French attack in the Basque region and were the masters of Navarre. That year, Fernando was crowned King of Navarre, and in 1515, he surprisingly decided to incorporate Navarre to the Kingdom of Castile.

	#-#King Federico III of Naples was unable to oppose much resistance, and the French entered Naples in August 1501. Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba met more resistance in the siege of Taranto, defended by Federico's son Ferdinando. Ferdinando surrendered Taranto to Spain on March 1502, and Fernando of Aragon did not keep Cordoba's promise of personal freedom to him, asking Cordoba to send him to Spain. His father King Federico III had already ceded the Kingdom to Louis XII King of France, who in exchange for it, appointed him Duke of Anjou. Federico III will die in 1504 in France. In 1550 with the death of his son Ferdinando, who was taken captive in Spain, the line of the House of Trastamara Naples will be definitely extinct. But the Kings had neglected to properly divide the regions of the Kingdom, leaving the Principati, the Basilicata and the Capitanata between both parts unassigned. The French denied that Capitanata (a land on which both Apulia and Abruzzi depended for food and flock wintering) was part of Apulia arguing recent administrative usage, and refused to allow the commissaries of Spain to collect the tolls on migrating flocks as the treaty stipulated. Soon incidents were taking place and open war broke out in July 1502. But the lack of decision by the French to attack when they had the advantage, the skill of Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba and the delays of Louis in bringing reinforcements will see the French expelled from Naples in one year. Completely defeated in Naples by Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba, Louis XII of France agreed at Blois in October of 1505 to cede his rights over Naples to his relative Germaine de Foix on her marriage to Fernando of Aragon. After the battle of Cerignola on 28 April 1503 Gonzalo Fernández will be remembered as el Gran Capitán. He introduced many of the reforms that would change the way battles were fought for centuries, and lead to the creation of the Spanish Tercios, and also trained most of the next generation of Spanish commanders.

	#-#In 1503, the Catholic Kings reorganized their army introducing a new set of regulations. These regulations were the basis for further reforms introduced that year by two military geniuses. Gonzalo de Ayora realized that the military units of the time were too small for the Renaissance wars, and joined several companies under command of captains into a new type of unit that he called colunela (after Italian colonna or column, later regiment) under command of a new type of officer called colonnelo, and later colonel. At the same time, Gonzalo Fernández de Cordoba, was using his experiences in the wars of Granada and in the first Italian Campaign (1494-1496) to introduce further reforms. From the moors he had learnt to introduce the terrain into the battle equation. From the Swiss at Seminara he learnt the value of pikers armed with swords. He then added two important contributions, a strong sense of loyalty to the general and the King, carefully cultivated to motivate the troops, and the importance of combined arms and firepower for the infantry. He increased the size of his companies to 500 men, of which 200 where pikers, 200 armed with short sword and buckler for short-range combat against enemy pikers, and 100 arquebusiers. This distribution allowed the companies to quickly change from march to combat order, to respond to attack from all sides, and to be effective at all ranges. He then increased the size of his regiments to 12 companies or 6000 infantry, plus 600 cavalry and 20 pieces of artillery. His army could have one or two regiments, being the size of a modern division. These modifications and others related to lines of supplies, intelligence gathering and dynamic defences at encampments resulted in the Spanish infantry being the most modern army of its time and heralded the end of the medieval cavalry. The victories over the French armies that year were continuous: ambush of Barletta, assault on Ruvo, second battle of Seminara, battle of Cerignola, failure of the French invasion of the Roselló, and battle of Garellano. At the capitulation of Gaeta the first of January, 1504, the Kingdom of Naples was won for Spain by el Gran Capitán.

	#-#Since 1495, Venice had been holding the main ports of Apulia despite Aragonese claims to have them back. With the French invasion of Milan, Venice had acquired Milanese territories east of the Adda River, and upon the fall of Cesare Borgia had also acquired Rimini, Faenza and Ravenna, against the will of Pope Julius II. The Venetians also held Veneto and Friuli, on which Maximilian of Habsburg had imperial claims. In late 1507 Maximilian announced his intention to travel to Italy to receive the imperial investiture from the Pope himself, and in early 1508 he assembled a big army to escort him down to Rome. He requested free passage through Venetian territories, but was told that he would be allowed passage only without his army. Enraged at the answer, Maximilian attacked Venice, but this decision proved unwise: Venice not only routed the imperial army but also seized the imperial cities of Trieste, Gorz and Fiume. A second assault by a Tyrolean force several weeks later was an even greater failure, forcing Maximilian to conclude a humiliating three-year truce. With Pope Julius II's assent, Maximilian took the title of 'Emperor-elect', thus breaking the century-old custom that the Holy Roman Emperor had to be crowned by the Pope. Shortly afterward, Venice provided a pretext for war by appointing her own candidate to the vacant bishopric of Vicenza. The Emperor, the King of France and Ferdinand of Aragon gathered in Cambrai in December 1508 to sign a treaty which seemed to be a defensive alliance against the Turk. In reality they meant to form a league to attack Venice and deprive the Serenissima of most of her mainland territories. Pope Julius II, after a renewed Venetian refusal to give the Romagna lands back to the Papacy, ratified the treaty and at the same time proceeded to excommunicate all Venetian citizens. Ferrara and Mantua, each with separate claims to territories held by Venice, joined the league as well. In April 1509 military operations started, and a month later French troops decimated one of the two Venetian armies at the battle of Agnadello. Even though in August 1509 Venice managed to eliminate Mantua from the war, she still faced the collapse of her strategic position and had by February 24, 1510 to accept the papal demands on the cities she had occupied in Romagna. However, Pope Julius II was still not satisfied and demanded that the war be prosecuted until Venice conceded control over their church to the Pope and compensated him for his expenses. The Council of Ten had privately resolved that the terms had been accepted under duress and were therefore invalid, and that Venice should violate them at the earliest opportunity. This opportunity presented itself shortly afterward.

But the reconciliation between Venice and the Pope did not stop the French to continue the war against Venice with attacks to her cities in Terraferma. Julius II, in the meanwhile, had become increasingly concerned by the growing French presence in Italy and formulated plans, both to chase the French out of the Po Valley and to seize the Duchy of Ferrara, a French ally, with the intention to add the territories of Modena, Reggio and Ferrara to the Papal States. In realizing his plan the Pope immediately excommunicated Alfonso d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, declaring his fief forfeited for his remaining loyal to France, then he gained the military support of Venice, eager to recover her territories lost to the French a armies and hired an army of Swiss mercenaries to attack Milan as to isolate the French armies in Italy. However his plans failed as the French army managed to invade Romagna and occupy the cities of Bologna and Ravenna, supported by the powerful and celebrated artillery of Duke Alfonso d'Este. In addition, in response to Pope's switching sides, Louis XII of France convoked a Schismatic Council at Pisa as to have the 'Warrior Pope' deposed. Pope Julius II, having unsuccessfully pressed the Republic of Florence to refuse hosting the schismatic cardinals, proclaimed the Holy League against France and convoked a Council of his own to meet at the Lateran in Rome. The promise of territorial gains at French expense caused Ferdinand II of Aragon and Emperor Maximilian I to abandon their alliance with the French, and in October 1511, they joined the newly-formed Holy League together with Julius II and the Republic of Venice. In November, Henry VIII of England and the Swiss confederation joined as well.

But his son Philip died unexpectedly early in 1506, leaving two male heirs, Charles and Ferdinand which were respectively born in 1500 and 1503. Maximilian decided to support Charles, who in 1516 was already Archduke of Burgundy, King of Spain, Sicily and Naples, in his investiture as King of the Romans and future Holy Roman Emperor. But this diplomatic move would have been very expensive. Most of the German princes were already supporting the French candidate, King François Ier. Maximilian seemed to successfully convoy the favour of the imperial electors towards the Habsburg cause, by means of granting investitures and making promises of large sums of money with the help of bankers such as the Fuggers and the Welsers. The Pope, who couldn't accept the presence of an Emperor with territorial claims in Italy as it was under the rule of Emperor Frederick II, would have supported a German prince like Friedrich III of Saxony, with no particular interest laying beyond the Alps. Looking for international credit, also Henry VIII King of England took part in the imperial election offering his candidature but withdrew soon after the first consultations.

After many hardships he succeeded in reaching and then sailing across the Pacific Ocean. Soon thereafter he was killed while trying to subdue the natives on what is now the island of Mactan in the Philippines. After still more hardships, one of his original five ships, Victoria, commanded by J. Sebastián Elcano eventually made it back to Spain. Only 18 out of initial approximatively 260 crew members made return to Spain after 3 years of navigation. Magellan's expedition was the first to circumnavigate the globe definitively proving the roundness of the earth and the first to navigate the strait in South America connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Antonio Pigafetta, a wealthy tourist who paid to be on the voyage, kept an accurate journal of the trip and provided the only extant eyewitness account of the events culminating in Magellan's death.

Anton Fugger (1525-1560) had trading concessions in Chile, Peru and Moscow. However, the company declined by the end of the 16th Century because of state bankruptcies in Spain, family conflicts and lack of interest on the part of the heirs. Financial support from Jakob Fugger allowed young Carlos to win the Imperial crown over a more prestigious François Ier, something that the King of France never forgave him. However the rents of Castile were mortgaged for several years to pay back the 850,000 florins loaned by the Fuggers at high interest, and the added taxation greatly increased the unhappiness of the Castilians with their foreign King.

Having proclaimed himself as the only legitimate heir of Charlemagne, the first Holy Roman Emperor, François Ier had announced his candidature to the imperial election. Commonly all the electors were bribed in order to obtain their much desired vote, but Charles 'bought' the Imperial title by paying the Great Electors and their emissaries the huge sum of 850,000 golden florins (equal to a value of 2,100 kilograms of gold). That money was advanced by his bankers in anticipation of several years worth of Castilian rents. Charles's election was also eased by the Army of the Svevian league, which impressed the doubtful electors when chasing the Duke of Württemberg, chief of the pro-French party, out of his duchy. That denied François his last remote chance to win the election. Being elected Holy Roman Emperor as Charles V, Charles (Karl in the German world or Carlos in Spain) of the House of Habsburg became suzerain of all the fiefs in the Holy Roman Empire. Amongst them the Duchy of Milan together with its sovereignty over the Republic of Genoa formed the beginning of the so-called 'Spanish Road' a critical route that allowed communication by land between the Habsburgs's dominions.

	#-#With the discovery of the New World, the Spanish had to decide what to do with their new subjects. Unlike the Muslims, that could be enslaved, pagans were seen as not having rejected Christianity, and hence entitled to freedom and religious education. To educate and indoctrinate the indians, a feudal institution was transplanted from Spain to the New World in 1493: the encomienda. Within this system, a group of indians were entrusted to the encomendero, who theoretically had no jurisdiction over them, and had to provide for their instruction and indoctrination and could not mistreat them. In exchange the encomendero was to receive tributes from his indians, in the form of indian products or labor. The system could not work with an ocean between the rulers and the colonists, and soon the encomenderos were taking the land from the indians in their encomienda, and exploiting them cruelly, often to death. Although the production and trade of the colonies increased on the slave work of the indians, soon voices raised against the inhumane treatment of the indians and their likely consequences. Between them, the most ardent advocate of the indians was Fray Bartolome de las Casas, a Dominican priest, that had been an encomendero himself. But the encomenderos were the political force in the colonies, and they were not willing to renounce to the source of their wealth. They claimed that without indian labor the economy of the colonies would collapse. At the same time, the encomiendas served as a great incentive for the conquests of the continent, as the conquistadors granted the conquered land and indians as encomiendas to their soldiers.

The Emperor and his court were horrified. After the conquest of New Spain (the Inca), Charles was displeased in the bloody way that it had been conducted by Pizarro and decided to regulate the treatment and rights of the Indians through legislation, according to the advice from Las Casas. The New Laws enacted in 1542 forbade any kind of slavery and forced labor, allowed ownership of land by the Indians, and stated that the Church had no authority over non-Christian natives. They also forbade the stablishment of new encomiendas and reduced the size of existing ones. The New Laws caused quite a stir in the colonies and it was predicted that they would bring ruin to the colonists.

	#-#With the New Laws that changed the system of encomiendas, the conquistadors believed that the King was depriving them of the just reward for their efforts and suffering. When the intransigent Viceroy Blasco Nuñez de Vela arrived to Lima to enforce the New Laws, a rebellion of encomenderos started in Peru, leaded by Gonzalo Pizarro, brother of Francisco. After killing the Viceroy, part of the rebels sailed to Panama, conquering the city. The rebellion lasted for four years, until 1548, when Gonzalo Pizarro was defeated in the battle of Jaquijahuana and beheaded. However the rebellions and protests had two important effects. The New Laws were amended, and although the slavery continued abolished, and the worst abuses prevented, the encomiendas were in fact sanctioned, much to the dismay of Las Casas. Similar systems to the encomiendas were also implemented by Portugal, France and Holland in their colonies. The other important effect was that the Royal Council forbade any new conquest unless the Council of the Indies deemed them esential. This policy was reversed in the 1560s due to the advance of the rival European powers.

The nobility continued to erode the cities position during the regency of Cisneros in 1516, so the commons were upset with Carlos delay to come to his realm. When 17 year old Carlos arrived from Burgundy, he illegally took the crown from his mad mother without much opposition, but he also behaved as a foreign King in a conquered country, appointing only Burgundians for government and extorting money from the cities, thus alienating both the nobles and the commons. When the chance to claim the imperial crown presented, Carlos extorted and mortgaged Castile rents to pay the Fuggers before leaving for Germany. The Castilian cities then revolted and formed the Santa Junta, defeating the scarce Royal forces, while the nobility stood aside unwilling to defend a King that had ignored their demands regarding court appointments. The rebels appealed to Juana the mad for support, but she was unwilling or unable to help them. With no other choice they turned to Carlos, ready to accept him if he was willing to return to the country, marry, reform his court, remove the foreigners and lower the taxes.

The arrival of a new viceroy in April 1520 precipitated the confrontation, and the guilds took control of Valencia. Soon battles erupted between the Germania and the nobles, spreading to Murcia and Mallorca. The Germania had also a marked anti-Muslim component, attacking the moriscos, sometimes forcing them to convert. This also eroded the economical power of the nobility, as the moriscos were their indentured serfs, and once converted they were freed from servitude. The King did not do anything, letting the nobles deal with the Germania. By March 1523 the Germania had been crushed and hundreds executed. The next year Charles issued a General Pardon.

It was a fatal mistake. The nobles reacted to the threat negotiating with Carlos the concessions they wanted and then formed a strong army. Although defeated in February 1521, they recovered soon, and on April 23, they crushed the Comuneros army at Villalar executing their leaders the following day. By February 1522, the last Comuneros surrendered and Carlos could afford to be magnanimous and issued a General Pardon to all but the main leaders. Carlos returned to Spain in 1522, married an Iberian woman, Isabel of Portugal, and appointed Spanish nobles to government. These were many of the Comuneros demands, but they were done on Carlos terms, after humbling the cities and restoring his relationships with the nobles.

Many French leaders died on the battlefield, such as De la Tremoille, La Palice and Bonnivet. King François Ier, instead, fell from his horse shot out under him, and taken captive. Since 24 February was Charles V's 25th birthday, the Valois was the biggest gift he could ever receive. François was carted off to Madrid, where he was held six months in prison for ransom, and pressed to renounce his claims in Italy and Flanders, to give Bourgogne back to the Empire and to concede the county of Provence to Charles, Connétable de Bourbon, and now leader of the imperial troops. The Emperor believed that the peace with France had finally been achieved after François Ier, agreeing to renounce his claims in Italy, was freed and retaken to France, leaving his sons there as hostages and guarantees for the respect of the treaty. But within two months of his release and in spite of his sons taken as hostages in Spain, François Ier got the Parliament of Paris to void all the terms of the Treaty of Madrid because accepted under duress and in 1526 at Cognac he stipulated a holy league bringing into it Pope Clement VII together with Florence, Venice, Henry VIII of England and also the Duke of Milan, who even if previously restored to the throne by Charles V himself, voluntarily joined the alliance made to stop the Spanish hegemony over Italy.

	#-#On the 24 of February 1525, in the battle of Pavia, the imperial armies led by Ferdinando Francesco d'Avalos, Marquis of Pescara (also winner at Bicocca in 1522), decimated the French troops led by King François Ier. Many French leaders died on the battlefield, such as De la Tremoille, La Palice and Bonnivet. King François Ier, instead, fell from his horse shot out under him, and taken captive. Since 24 February was Charles V's 25th birthday, the Valois was the biggest gift he could ever receive. François was carted off to Madrid, where he was held six months in prison for ransom, and pressed to renounce his claims in Italy and Flanders, to give Bourgogne back to the Empire and to concede the county of Provence to Charles, Connétable de Bourbon, and now leader of the imperial troops. The Emperor believed that the peace with France had finally been achieved after François Ier, agreeing to renounce his claims in Italy, was freed and retaken to France, leaving his sons there as hostages and guarantees for the respect of the treaty. But within two months of his release and in spite of his sons taken as hostages in Spain, François Ier got the Parliament of Paris to void all the terms of the Treaty of Madrid because accepted under duress and in 1526 at Cognac he stipulated a holy league bringing into it Pope Clement VII together with Florence, Venice, Henry VIII of England and also the Duke of Milan, who even if previously restored to the throne by Charles V himself, voluntarily joined the alliance made to stop the Spanish hegemony over Italy.

It was impossible for Atahuallpa to understand anything, as it was the first time he saw a book, and the interpreter barely could speak some words of Spanish or Quechua. Irritated, Atahuallpa threw down the Bible and demanded compensation for the plundering of the Spaniards. His act triggered an attack by the Spaniards. 'Santiago! Y a ellos!' Was the war cry that echoed through the great plaza at Cajamarca. Spanish cavalry charged into the courtyard, slashing at Inca flesh. Even unarmed, the Inca opposed determined resistance and hundreds of them were killed. However with the capture of the Emperor, resistance collapsed and the survivors escaped. Atahuallpa, knowing the lust for gold of the strangers, offer them a room filled with gold and silver up to the reach of his hand.

Atahuallpa had ordered the execution of his brother from his prison, and the Spaniards feared that he could sooner or later order an attack despite the risk to his life. Two sides were split in Pizarro's band of men: while most wanted to kill Atahuallpa, some saw it as dishonorable and unlawful, as Atahuallpa had complied with all their requests. Finally Pizarro took the decision, and a mock trial was set up. Atahuallpa was accused of repeatedly rejecting conversion, incestuous relationship with his sister and killing his brother, all of them true, and sentenced to death. Since he was going to burn at the stake he accepted conversion to avoid a death that would prevent his eternal life, as the one he had given his brother. He was therefore strangled. The King of Spain was highly displeased with the killing of a monarch but it was too late to do anything about it. The decision, however, proved to be strategically correct, as without his emperor the Inca empire collapsed into the hands of the Spaniards.

Villac Umu counseled Manco Inca to send out secret orders for gathering weapons and large crop plantings in preparation for war with the Spaniards. He made his move around Easter 1536. Having won the trust of Hernando, he was granted permission to attend a ceremony northwest of Cuzco, instead he and Villac Umu convened a war council in the mountains. When Manco Inca did not return, Hernando Pizarro realized the mistake he made by letting him go, an Inca counterattack seemed imminent. Soon an army numbering in the tens of thousands was besieging the Spanish held city of Cuzco, and another Inca army was sighted heading towards the Spanish stronghold of Lima. Manco's warriors annihilated every relief column sent from Lima to Cuzco. An alarmed Francisco Pizarro sent frantic letters to every Spanish possession in the new world asking for reinforcements, and hoping that he could hold back the Inca armies until help arrived...

	#-#Antonio Pigafetta belonged to a rich family of Vicenza. In his youth he studied astronomy, geography and cartography. He served on board the galleys of the order of St. John at the beginning of 16th century. In 1519 he accompanied the Papal Nuncio, Monsignor Chieregati, to Spain where he was presented to the Emperor Carlos I (V). There he heard of the trip of Magellan and negotiated to be admitted as a paying passenger, a supernumerary. In spite of initial difficulties with Magellan, he managed to gain his confidence and served as a chronicler and cartographer for him. During the trip, Pigafetta collected information about geography, the climate, the flora, the fauna and the inhabitants of the visited places. His meticulous notes were to serve as invaluable documents to future explorers and cartographers, mainly due to their focus on nautical and linguistic data. In the battle at Mactan, Philippines, in which Magellan was killed, Pigafetta also was hurt. Nevertheless, he managed to recover and was among the 18 on board the Victoria who accompanied Juan Sebastián Elcano in his return to Spain. After reaching port in Sanlúcar de Barrameda (Cadiz) in September of 1522, three years after his departure, he recollected his experiences in 'Relations of the First Round-the-world Trip', composed in Italian and published in Venice. After that voyage Pigafetta returned to Italy where he died in his native city in 1534.

	#-#The 14,000 lansquenets, hired by Charles V in the war against the League of Cognac under the command of Georg von Frundsberg, were animated by a violent spirit of crusade against the Pope (Frundsberg was bringing a golden rope with which he insanely meant to hang the Pope and his cardinals!) but also, and most of all, angry for lack of pay. Abandoned by their captains, they begun to plunder villages in search of loots. Soon they were joined by 6,000 Spanish soldiers lead by Charles, Connétable de Bourbon, and by any sort of ruffians of any condition (mercenaries at the Emperor's service, deserting or disbanded troops of the League and common criminals), all of them with the common aim to make the way to Rome, the city of sin, and 'sack' it. On the morning of 6 May 1527, from his headquarters set up on the Gianicolo hill, Captain General Bourbon with his 40,000 soldiers launched a series of attacks on Rome. During one of them, at the Torrione Gate, while leading the assault of the walls, he himself was mortally wounded (Benvenuto Cellini, who took part in the defence of the walls, would boast about having shot the deadly bullet). Instead of being let down, the Spanish troops' confidence was boosted by their commander's sudden death and at the expenses of big losses, managed to break through the city walls and enter the Borgo while the imperial lansquenets broke rushed towards the Holy See. Pope Clement VII and his followers were able to escape into safety, thanks to the 'Passetto', a secret corridor which Pope Alexander VI had built along the top of the wall connecting the Vatican with Castel Sant'Angelo. Across the Sisto bridge the bewildered soldiers fell on the unarmed city and for eight days committed every sort of violence, theft, sacrilege and massacre. The streets were a mixture of drunken soldiers, corpses and heaps of every sort of luxury goods taken from churches, monasteries and palaces. No league army dared to enter the city to drive out the ravaging troops and rescue the Pope, who accepted to pay a huge ransom only six months later. Although the exact role of the emperor in this act is unclear, it hurt his standing internationally, and caused something of a domestic crisis. It was one of the motivations for the alliance between England and France in 1527, and for the war with those countries that followed.

The Welser then turned to squeeze Venezuela as much as possible to try to recover their money, leading to complaints, and a lengthy trial, 1541-56, that ended in the revocking of the concession to the Welser.

The expedition was epic due to the difficulties found, and finally 178 men under his command reached the valleys inhabited by the Muisca, also called the Chibcha. They were one of the most advanced cultures in América, and extremely rich due to their mining of emeralds, copper and salt, that traded for gold to other tribes. In one year Quesada and his band had conquered the estimated one million Muiscas using the tipical conquistador tactics of using internal divisions and seizing the zipa (ruler) and using him as a puppet before putting him to trial and executing him. The treasure seized was amazing, and third only to the Aztec and Inca treasures. The royal fifth amounted to 70 kg of gold and 576 emeralds. However Quesada, now inmensely rich but with troubles with the authorities due to his mistreatment of the Indians, was convinced that this treasure was only a small part of what he could get if he was capable of finding El Dorado.

The obsession of Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada with El Dorado led him to obtain permission for a new expedition in 1569, putting his huge personal fortune in the line to finance it. The expedition departed with 400 Spaniards, 1500 Indians and 8 priests, and returned empty-handed in December 1572 with 64 Spaniards, 4 Indians and 2 priests, being one of the most expensive disasters in the Spanish conquest, almost ruining Quesada. But these two disastrous expeditions did not kill the myth. When it became evident that El Dorado was not to be found in Nueva Granada (Colombia), it was simply moved to the last unexplored part of the continent, the Guiana, where the last person to look for it was Sir Walter Raleigh who conducted two failed expeditions in 1595 and 1616. After that, the myth was finally put to rest, but in 1856, the drainage of the Siecha lake, in Muisca territory, allowed the discovery of a gold boat with ten figures, one of which was a chieftain. The gold boat, now in the Bogotá museum, proved that the ceremony that gave origen to the myth was authentic, and that Quesada found El Dorado without knowing it.

The so called Ladies' Peace was successful, the signatories were the only ones who could have influence in the political decisions of the two monarchs and managed to induce them to make peace for the wealth of their respective countries. Signing that treaty, France had to renounce her claims to Milan, Asti, Flanders and Artois, while Spain gave up her inheritance rights to the Duchy of Bourgogne, a French fief. François Ier had also to withdraw all his troops from Italy and marry Eleanor, Charles's sister, in return for the liberation of his two sons, hostages at the Spanish court because of François Ier's disrespect for the treaty of Madrid.

	#-#The Emperor believed that peace had finally been achieved with France after Francis I agreed to renounce his claims in Italy. But within two months of his release, Francis had retracted from his word and signed the league of Cognac, bringing into it the Pope, Milan, Florence, Venice and England. But for Giulio de Medici, Pope Clement VII, it was a huge mistake to take sides with France, as Rome was sacked by the Lutheran German mercenaries of Charles under lack of pay. Charles got his army under control, and Clement became his prisoner, and had to pay 300,000 ducats and surrender several fortresses for his release. But in the meantime, the Florentines had raised and expelled the Medici, declaring a Republic, and part of the Papal States also wanted to become independent. Now Clement needed Charles more than the emperor needed the Pope and a deal was struck. Charles agreed to restore the Papal States, to return Florence to Medici rule, to name Clement's illegitimate son from a black slave Alessandro Medici, il Moro, hereditary Duke of Florence and to give him his own illegitimate daughter from a Flemish servant, Margaret of Austria, in marriage. In exchange Clement will crown him as emperor and will become his lifelong ally. The treaty of Barcelona was signed on June 29, 1529, and Clement and Charles will meet at Bologna at the end of the year, with the crowning taking place on February 24, 1530 in the same city. Charles V will be the last Holy Roman Emperor to be crowned by a Pope. A consequence of this alliance will be that Clement will refuse the divorce of Henry VIII from the emperor's aunt, Catalina, even at the cost of driving England into Protestantism.

Princes and ambassadors of all Italian states came to this encounter with the intention to confirm their allegiance to the Empire. Charles V used his strengthened political influence to definitely settle the Italian balance of powers and the conflicts between the Italian minors that deceitfully used to switch sides between France and the Empire. According to Mercurino da Gattinara's advices Charles V granted independence to all the imperial fiefs and, with the mediation of Pope Clemens VII, even to Francesco Sforza who was reinstated in his duchy in spite of his joining the league of Cognac. Pope Clemens VII instead, receiving the territory of Parma was to renounce his claims to Modena and Ferrara and to promise to arrange for a Concile in the next future to discuss about the Reform of the Church. Settled the political affairs in the peninsula, Charles was crowned by Pope Clement VII King of Italy on 22 February 1530 and Holy Roman Emperor two day later, in two solemn ceremonies arranged in Bologna. The imperial crown was a really big gift for his 30th birthday: Charles V resulted, in facts, the last Holy Roman Emperor in history to be personally crowned by the Pope.

	#-#After the peace of Cambrai, Carlos decided to reorganize his troops in Italy. In his reformation of 1534, he created the Tercios, based on the previous reforms of el Gran Capitán, while modernizing them. Each Tercio was constituted by 3000 men divided in three regiments and 12 companies and was commanded by a Field Marshall. For the first time it included an army command staff that took care of administrative and judicial tasks as well as participating in the military decisions. The elimination of swordsmen allowed an increase in the number of pikers and arquebusiers which carried a sword to fight at close range, resulting in an increase of the Tercios firepower, their main characteristic. The soldiers of the Tercio were all volunteers trained within the regiment giving the units a great cohesion that always allowed them to attack or retreat in good order, greatly increasing their efficiency. The first Tercios formed where those of Naples, Sicily, Sardinia and Lombardy. They were called the old Tercios. Later new Tercios were created, including the Sea Tercios as the first specific units of marines of the world, and the Flandern Tercios in 1567. The reformation was very successful, and over a century the Spanish Tercios were considered invincible. The Tercios will last until 1704 when they were dissolved by Felipe V to adopt a French regiment organization.

	#-#At Francesco II Sforza's death, the Duchy of Milan reverted to the Empire and as Charles V newly rejected the French Orléans candidature to the Milanese throne, François Ier, King of France, planned a new military campaign in Italy against Charles V, this time with the help of the Turk. At first the French King attacked Savoy, because Duke Charles III refused French military access through his possessions, and annexed it with the assertion he had a dynastical claim to it. Deeply annoyed by this behaviour, Charles V sent an expeditionary force to conquer Provence, once imperial land. The expedition unfortunately failed while the scary Ottoman menace over Italy led Pope Paulus III to warmly invite the two contenders to make peace and form a Christian league in order to face the Turks. In 1538 in Nice a decennial truce was concluded with Papal support. But that cease-fire couldn't last too long. In 1542 Milan had to face a new French attack which resulted in an imperial heavy defeat at Ceresole in Piemonte, but although northern Italy totally fell under French control, at the same time English and Spanish-Imperial troops attacked France from both sides: even Paris was under menace. Lack of supplies and low troops reinforcements brought Charles V to eventually sign a peace treaty with François Ier at Crépy in late 1544. With that treaty France was recognized possession of Piemonte, still under French control and in spite of Savoyard legal claims to those lands, instead the Emperor was confirmed suzerainty over the duchy of Milan. That treaty also stated that François Ier had to renounce his claims to Naples, Flanders and Artois, while Charles V had to abandon any claim to the duchy of Bourgogne, ancestral Burgundian feud. It was also agreed that a diplomatic marriage had to be arranged between the youngest of François's sons, Charles Duke of Orléans and, either the Emperor's daughter (bringing Flanders and Franche-Comté as dowry) or the Emperor's niece and Ferdinand's daughter (bringing Milan as dowry). That would be by Emperor's choice. After two month's thoughts, Charles V decided to concede his daughter as spouse to Charles of Orléans, together with the dowry of Milan. However, in late 1545 the sudden death of Charles of Orléans liberated Charles V from the treaty's obligations and on 5 July 1546 he could invest his son Don Felipe with the Duchy of Milan. With this act, the imperial fief of Milan became definitively direct dominion of the Spanish line of the House of Habsburg.

In fact, due to their higher education and wealth, the converts soon reached positions not available to them before their conversion. The Spanish society of the Old Christians reacted to them with rejection, but the problem was how to identify them. The solution was the Statutes of Blood Cleanliness, that demanded that to achieve a certain position, the candidate was required to demonstrate that his ancestors were Old Christians. They were imposed by the society against the wishes of the Kings and popes starting in Toledo in 1449. Gradually some university colleges, religious orders and military orders were imposing them. Cases of false converts discovered by the Inquisition between friars fueled them, leading to a papal approval in 1496. The priest Juan Martinez Siliceo was named religious educator of prince Felipe by the Emperor Carlos, and was rewarded with the position of Archbishop of Toledo, and later Cardinal. He was an intransigent fanatic, and he was able to impose the Statutes of Blood Cleanliness in the Church in 1547 despite important opposition. Soon they were extended to any position of responsibility, both public and private. The Status were an important factor in the obsession with racial purity and lineage that overtook the Spanish society for 200 years, since it was essential to have a clean lineage to advance in the society.

In 1557 Francisco de Villagra killed the Toqui (war leader) Lautaro, and the next year his successor Caupolicán was killed by the new governor, García Hurtado de Mendoza. Although the Spaniards suffered a few setbacks, for the most part of this phase of the war they were victorious and by 1570 the Arauco was apparently pacified by Pedro de Villagra and Rodrigo de Quiroga. One of García Hurtado's captains was the poet Alonso de Ercilla, who wrote his masterwork La Araucana based on these events. However the Araucanians were far from pacified but were only taking a respite from plagues and defeats.

Meanwhile the Jesuits were trying to convince the government that Indian resistance was due to Spanish repressive methods. It was worth trying, so the mystic father Luis de Valdivia was authorized in 1612 to promise the Araucanians peace and Spanish retreat from their lands in exchange for accepting missionaries. Obviously as soon as the military left, the missionaries were cruelly put to death. By 1626, it was clear that the defensive war proposed by the Jesuits was a complete failure and was abandoned. However plagues and racial mixing were slowly reducing the Araucanian resistance.

But the new capital lacked a Palace, a central Government building and a proper place for the burial of the new Habsburg dynasty - the Spanish Line. Guided by his profound religiousness and a practical sense, Felipe decided to unite everything in the same place, a monastery dedicated to Saint Lawrence to celebrate the victory over the French at Saint-Quentin on August 10, 1557, that Saint's day. The monastery of San Lorenzo del Escorial took 21 years to complete in the form of a severely rectilinear complex, with numerous internal courtyards, modeled on the grill on which Saint Lawrence was martyred (roasted to death). Despite its Habsburg austere religious style, it contained the best library on old manuscripts after the Vatican Library. From the royal chambers surrounding the basilica's main altar, the empire were the sun never set was ruled by the Prudent King.

They were given their name in the expedition of Villalobos of 1542, to honor prince Philip, future King of Spain. Andres de Urdaneta, a sailor in that expedition, that had become a friar, claimed that he could find a way of returning from the East Indies to Mexico accross the Pacific, a trip that in 40 years had only been done in the opposite way. His claim raised the interest of the authorities and an expedition was organized. Urdaneta wanted to go to New Guinea, and island discovered by the Spaniards. The expedition was put under command of Miguel Lopez de Legazpi. When they departed from Barra de Navidad (Jalisco) on November 21, 1564, they opened the orders that commanded them to the Philippines and Urdaneta accepted them. After reaching the islands and exploring them, and while Legazpi started the conquest, Urdaneta sailed Northwest until he discovered the current of Kuro Siwo, that took him for the first time, back to America, arriving to Acapulco in October 1565. The return trip was very long and dangerous, taking from 5 to 7 months, but it was very important because it stablished the connexion of the Philippines to the rest of the empire, allowing the viability of its colonization. The conquest of the Philippines led Charles V to declare that in his realms the sun never set, a phrase that became popular for future empires also.

The conquest of the Philippines was for Spain the most difficult of all. However it also compensated the effort. In Philippines existed a colony of Chinese traders, and Europe longed for Chinese wares. However China was self-suficcient. The only product that China sought was silver, and Spain produced silver in Mexico and Peru. Additionally, the Eastern route from Philippines to Spain around the Cape of Good Hope was closed by the Dutch, so an indirect trade route was established by a fleet that connected Manila to Acapulco, and then by land to Veracruz, where the fleet of Indias would take the trade to Sevilla. Almost every year, a fleet would depart from Acapulco to Manila loaded with silver, and another would depart from Manila to Acapulco loaded with spices, silkcloths and chinaware. The benefits were enormous, between 300 and 500 percent, and the arrival of the Manila galleon constituted one of the main events in Mexico and Spain, as people were fascinated with their products. Protectionist measures from the traders in Sevilla regulated the number of ships to two merchant galleons plus escorts, and the galleons from Manila became the biggest ships built in their time.

Coupled with their failure to integrate into the greater Christian society and their nominal allegiance to Christianity they were seen as a threat by the Spanish authorities to the integrity of Christian Spain itself. Their less than covert aid to Muslim raiders and pirates off the coast of Spain only reinforced the fears of the authorities who were already greatly concerned over the rising power of the Muslim Ottoman Turks. Under the leadership of Suleiman the Magnificent the Turks were asserting control over the entire Eastern Mediterranean and threatened Italy and Sicily as well.\n \n For their part the Morisques felt threatened by ever-mounting taxes on the silk trade that furnished the basis for their livelihoods and Spanish challenges to their land titles. They tried to negotiate with the King to resolve their differences, but Felipe II would have nothing to do with their proposals. They responded by revolting on Christmas Eve, 1568. They had a number of early successes, aided by the lack of Spanish troops who'd recently been sent to reinforce the Duke of Alba's forces in the Netherlands as well as aid from their co-religionists in North Africa, but they were eventually overwhelmed by forces led by Don Juan de Austria, half-brother of Felipe II. As punishment the King decreed that they be deported to other provinces of Castile in order to break up the cohesive communities that reinforced their isolation from Christian society. Christian colonists were recruited from Castile to replace the Morisques, although this policy proved to be less than completely successful.

	#-#Felipe II was only married for one year to Maria Manuela of Portugal from whom he had a heir, prince Carlos, before she died. However soon it was evident that Carlos had some mental disease. He was incoherent, sadistic, choleric, and unpredictable, frightening those around him, and filling the court with anxiety about the future of the Kingdom in such hands. His madness was manifested in many ways, but the most famous one was when he tried to run away to the Low Countries to take command of the Protestants against his own father. The situation was unsustainable, especially when he started to attack with knives and swords significant members of the court like the Duke of Alba or his uncle Don Juan. On the night of the 18th of January, 1568, the prince was confined under vigilance in his quarters. Four months later the prince died of unknown causes. The best theory is that his behavior worsened in captivity and it was not unusual for him to fast for days and then stuff himself with his favorite meals, with one of this pantagruelian feasts causing his death. Since no explanation could be given about his death at the time, the many enemies of Felipe II used it to start a black legend about him. The legend was given credit and the mad Carlos was turned into a romantic hero that fought against the oppression of his father. Schiller wrote a theater piece named Don Carlos in 1787, and Verdi turned it into an opera in 1867. In fact, madness was running in the family, starting with Isabel of Portugal, mother of Isabel la Catolica, and following with her granddaughter Juana the Mad, grandmother of Felipe II.

In January 1546 he was invested in the Golden Fleece Order by Charles V at the same time as the Duke of Alba. At the battle of Saint Quentin in 1557 he led the cavalry at the initial charge, contributing decisively to the Spanish victory over the French troops. A year later he commanded the Spanish army at the decisive victory of Gravelines, where he defeated the French troops led by Montmorency and became a national hero. As a reward he was appointed as stadtholder of Flanders by King Felipe. Although a devout Catholic, faithful to his King, he protested the introduction of the Inquisition in Flanders by bishop Granvelle. He nevertheless reconciled with Felipe and pleaded a change of policy in the Netherlands. When the Dutch revolts started and the Duke of Alba was sent to suppress them with the Edict of Blood, William of Orange advised Egmont and Hoorn to flee Brussels with him. But Egmont and Hoorn believed that their loyalty to the King protected them. Alba arrested them under accusation of treason. In vain Egmont pleaded to be judged by his peers of the Golden Fleece Order or having his case taken to the King. They were both condemned and executed on June 5, 1568. Their death led to large protests in the Netherlands, and contributed to the resistance against the Spaniards. Egmont is the main character in a play of the same name by Goethe.

The expedition of Esteban Rodríguez de Figueroa, after the invasion of Brunei, succeeded in temporarily vassalizing Sulu, while a attack on Mindanao was mostly unsuccessful. The Muslims in Philippines were also called Moros, as the Muslims in the North of Africa and the Iberian Peninsula were called because of their relationship to the Roman Mauri.

He was extraordinarily intelligent and raised to the post of his father with Felipe II, but being disolute and unescrupulous, soon became corrupt. He became the lover of the widow of his former protector, the one-eyed princess of Eboli. Their intrigues lead Antonio Perez to order the killing of the secretary of the King's half brother, Juan de Austria, in March 1578, because he knew too much and was pressuring him. Although initially Felipe II was inclined to protect him, the outcry from the opposite faction was too big, and although the charges for murder were not brought upon him, a long process for corruption, that was to take several years, was initiated.

Felipe then resorted to the only tribunal whose jurisdiction reached all the Kingdoms, the Inquisition. Charges of heresy were brought upon Antonio Perez, using also his sacrilegous origen as son of a Catholic priest and a married woman, and the Inquisition ordered his transfer to its own jail in Zaragoza. But, the Justice decided that the fueros were being violated and raised in rebellion, and the Viceroy of Aragon was killed. The army was sent to Zaragoza, where it entered without a shot, as the rebellion dissolved. But by then Antonio Perez had escaped to France. The Justice was executed for high treason, and the royal authority reinforced.

This act followed the Union of Utrecht. The Oath of Abjuration meant a climax in the Dutch Revolt, a point of no return, in which the Low Countries asserted they were no longer loyal to their King. Sometimes, the oath is interpreted as an act of secession from Spain, but this is strictly speaking incorrect, as the provinces were never legally incorporated into the Spanish Kingdoms, but were only bound to them by the looser tie of personal union. Legally, the oath deposed the provinces' current ruler, Philip of Habsburg - who, by dynastic coincidence, was also King of Spain. Philip's attempts to unify his various realms under a more centralized government based in Madrid were the major drivers behind the oath. Philip used troops from Spain and other areas loyal to him (such as Wallonia and Italy) to fight the rebels. In the Oath, the Staten-Generaal (the General Estates, a sort of federal parliament) assert that a King is a servant of his people and should respect their laws and traditions. When he no longer does this, the people have the right to choose another ruler.

The order fell hardest on Aragon, Valencia and Murcia because they had large numbers of unassimilated Morisques from the earlier stages of the Reconquista. Valencia lost almost a third of its population and Aragon almost a fifth. But Felipe III and his advisors thought this was a cheap price to pay for cleansing Spain of its hated minority and to reassert the power and prestige of the Crown, both badly damaged by its defeats by the Protestant heretics.

	#-#Following the undeclared war that Elizabeth, Queen of England, was waging against Spain, attacking her fleets, coastal cities and colonies, and supporting the Dutch protestants at war against Spain, Felipe decided to attack England, and gave orders to prepare a huge fleet to lead an invasion. But the problems started before the fleet was assembled, when Alvaro de Bazan, the Marquis of Santa Cruz, hero of many naval battles, died. The operation was put under the command of Alonso Guzman, the Duke of Medina-Sidonia, who was a great organizer and contributed financially, but was no seaman. 130 ships with 30,000 men departed Lisbon, but of them only 20 were big galleons, and most of the ships were merchant ships of many classes refitted with cannons and some Mediterranean galleases. Bad leadership, terrible storms and superior English naval tactics and cannons, turned the expedition into a disaster. The crucial point of the expedition, the embarkment of the Tercios of Alessandro Farnese, the Duke of Parma, near Calais, could not be achieved. The return trip was a nightmare due to bad weather, and in total 60 ships and 20,000 men were lost, 85 percent of them in the coasts of Ireland. The news were badly received in Spain, little used to serious defeats, but a lesson was learned. The crown understood that it needed a permanent royal navy, and that the ships and cannons had to be improved. As a consequence the Spanish navy was improved, corsair attacks diminished, the colonies were safer and the fleet of Indias arrived with regularity. Spain continued ruling the seas until the next century, when the Dutch achieved naval superiority over the then decadent Spanish empire.

But for England it was difficult to quickly obtain financing for such an expensive enterprise, and so the goals were expanded to attract new investors. The fleet was to destroy the Spanish ships under repair, to invade Portugal to trigger a rebellion and instate a Portuguese claimant on the throne, to capture the Azores, and to capture also the Spanish treasure fleet to compensate the expenses for a financially troubled England. Francis Drake and John Norris were put in command, but the expedition resulted in a disaster of a similar magnitude to the Spanish armada. Nothing of substance was achieved, and a military defeat at Lisbon, diseases and storms, decimated the fleet, that it is said to have lost 10,000 men. Thanks to it, the Spanish fleet recovered and in the next decade dominated again the seas, shipping three times more gold than the previous decades, while England suffered a chain of defeats. The most important of them was the disastrous raid to Puerto Rico and Panama in 1595, also with great loss of lives, including those of the hated corsairs Hawkins and Drake. The Spanish colonial empire was safe. As a result of these defeats and the financial troubles of England, James I would seek peace with Spain in the same terms offered by Felipe II prior to the Spanish Armada, but by then the war in the Low Countries had already been lost.

After unifying the country, he started an expansionistic policy, invading Korea. He sent a menacing letter to the Spanish governor of the Philippines demanding their submission to Japan in 1591. Governor Dasmariñas sent a peace embassy formed by several Franciscans and leaded by Fray Pedro Bautista in 1593. The embassy was successful, and Hideyoshi allowed them to stay in Kyoto. Their work was fruitful between the oppressed Japanese lower classes, and soon they expanded to Nagasaki and Osaka. But all that changed when a Spanish galleon from Manila in route to Acapulco shipwrecked in the island of Sikoku, loaded with a treasure in luxury merchandise from China, India, and the Philippines. The samurai of Sikoku and Hideyoshi representatives started to dispute over the cargo, but a ship's officer reclaimed its ownership by Spain. To further his demands he showed a map with all the lands owned by Spain to be compared with the size of Japan. He was asked how so many lands could be conquered when in their ships so few soldiers were carried. -We first send the priests- was his imprudent answer. Hideyoshi reacted to this words by ordering the crucifixion of all the Franciscans. Six Spanish and seventeen Japanese Franciscan friars, together with 3 Jesuits thrown in the lot were tortured and crucified. It was only the beginning of the repression, and after the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1613, the country was closed to Europeans for 284 years from 1637, and Christianity eradicated by mass executions. The Philippines governor was in no condition to respond, and so the route of the Manila galleon was changed from the Kuro Siwo current to the Equatorial Counter Current, to protect its cargo.

The solution applied by Queen Elizabeth I was the establishment of the Plantations, depriving the Irish from their land and giving it to English settlers. When the plantations reached Ulster, Hugh O'Neill, the great Earl of Tyrone rose in rebellion and asked the King of Spain for help. Felipe III considered that it was a good opportunity to tie up English resources and sent a small army under command of Don Juan de Aguila that landed near Cork on October 2, 1601. The landing at the South of the Island when the rebels were at the North, lack of coordination, and lack of Irish experience in pitched battles, contributed to their defeat at the hands of the English army of Lord Mountjoy on January 3, 1602 (December 24, 1601 for the English Julian calendar) at Kinsale. The Spaniards embarked and left Ireland, but Felipe continued supporting the rebels with money. The rebellion was finally suppressed by the English scorched earth strategy, and O'Neill surrendered in March 1603. However the Irish rebellion nearly bankrupted England and contributed to the signing of peace between England and Spain. The Irish did not forget the help received from Spain even if insufficient.

	#-#After the Irish rebellion was defeated, many Irishmen left the island and entered the service of Spain, leading to the creation of several Irish Tercios (regiments) that participated in the wars in Netherlands. Their two best commanders were Thomas Preston and Owen Roe O'Neill. Owen Roe (Red) was a nephew of Hugh O'Neill, the great Earl of Tyrone (Ulster) that left Ireland in the Flight of the Earls. He joined the King's army in 1603, when the Irish rebels surrendered, and by 1605 he was already captain. He distinguished himself in many battles, and became famous after his defence of Arras for two months with only 1500 men against 90,000 French soldiers. Thomas Preston was from Meath (Leinster), and entered service with 2,000 Irish soldiers under his command in 1605. He is famous for his defence of Leuven. Both commanders actively recruited Irish soldiers for the Spanish army, and participated in the famous conquest of Breda immortalized by Velazquez. However as good Irish, they were separated by bitter rivalry. After the Irish rebellion of 1641, they both abandoned the service of Spain to join the Irish rebels. Preston was made commander of the Leinster forces and met with mixed results. O'Neill became the commander in chief of the Ulster forces and had great success against the English, until the dissensions between the Confederates paved the way for the Irish defeat and the terrible massacres of Cromwell. Preston would be created Viscount Tara by King Charles II in exile in 1650.

The Jesuits allowed the natives to maintain their culture and language, posession of the land and self-government, in exchange for abandoning polygamy and embracing Christianity and organized work. The system was very successful, and the 60 missions established greatly increased the wealth of the area. However the jesuit system also had enemies in the Indians that rejected any pact with the white men, the hacienda owners with whom the system competed, and the Portuguese slave traders. 23 Jesuits paid with their lives their missionary work, but not one of them was killed by the indians that voluntarily entered the Reductions system.

	#-#The Bandeiras were armed expeditions privately funded by the Portuguese of Brazil to make incursions beyond the Treaty of Tordesillas line. Usually they went into the jungle and enslaved any Indian they could capture. With the union of the crowns of Spain and Portugal, the Bandeirantes started to attack also the Spanish possessions north of the Rio de la Plata, knowing that as an internal problem, the King would be more lenient. When the Dutch disrupted navigation in the coasts of Brazil during and after the 20 years truce with Spain, the slave traffic from Africa to the Brazilian plantations stopped. Suddenly the Bandeiras became much more profitable. The missions that the Jesuits had established in Paraguay had attracted tens of thousands of indians and owned hundreds of thousands of cattle and were an easy target. Between 1628 and 1638 the Bandeirantes destroyed ten missions, killing thousands of indians and taking over 25,000 captives of which only one quarter would reach Sao Paulo alive. The entire region of Guayrá was desolated. In 1638 the Superior of the Jesuits, Father Ruiz Montoya, travelled to Spain and submitted 12 petitions to Felipe IV to allow the Indians to be armed with firearms for their defense. Concerns about the safety of Rio de la Plata and Peru if Paraguay fell to the Portuguese, finally moved Felipe to agree. The military instruction of the Indians under three Jesuit ex-soldiers, and 11 Spaniards from Buenos Aires started that same year, and a Bandeirada was defeated at Caazapaguazú, but upon their surrender the Bandeirantes were allowed to retire. Their return to Sao Paulo coincided with the arrival of envoys with royal charters and Papal Bulls against the enslaving of Indians and caused much indignation. The municipal chamber (city council) expelled the Jesuits of Sao Paulo and organized an expedition of 450 Bandeirantes and 2700 Indians under command of Manuel Pires. Father Pedro Romero, the Jesuit commander, had 4200 Guaranies and 300 arquebuses. The Bandeirantes were coming down the River Uruguay and were surprised at the river bend at Mbororé on March 11, 1641. The fight was favorable to the Indians, who had also fortified both shores. The Bandeirantes retreated and dug in, and tried to surrender, but the Indians had had enough, and for days they pursued the fleeing Bandeirantes through the jungle. Few made it back to Sao Paulo. Slowly, the destroyed missions were rebuilt.

The Governor of Buenos Aires, José de Garro quickly seized the colony with the help of Guarani Indians and captured Lobo, but the colony was returned the next year by the Provisional Treaty of Lisbon of 1681. When Portugal entered the War of Spanish Succesion in 1705, the Governor of Buenos Aires, Valdez de Inclán, captured again Sacramento with Guarani soldiers, but it had to be returned to Portugal once more under the Peace of Utrecht in 1715. In 1724 the Portuguese started to expand in the area, leading the Governor of Buenos Aires, Mauricio de Zabala, to found San Felipe y Santiago de Montevideo in 1726, strongly increasing Spanish control over the Banda Oriental region, or eastern shore of the Rio de la Plata.

For two years both armies conducted an inefectual war against the guerrilla tactics of the Indians. Finally in 1756, both armies joined forces, and after the killing of José Sepé, they slaughtered 1300 Indians at Caibaté, suffering four casualties. Soon they took control of the region with a final death toll of about 6000 Indians. These events are narrated in the movie ''The Mission.'' After the campaign, Freire and Valdelirios, wrote letters blaming the Jesuit order for instigating the Indians, and arrested 11 fathers. The matters were investigated by the new Governor of Buenos Aires, Pedro de Ceballos, and by the Jesuit order, whose General Ignazio Visconti had given orders, under penalty of mortal sin, expulsion, and excommunication, of colaborating with the authorities. The investigations did not find any evidence to substantiate the accusations, and the case was superseded to the indignation of Freire and the Marquis of Pombal, Masons and enemies of the order. The Marquis of Pombal took matters into his own hands and wrote a pamphlet entitled ''Brief account of the Jesuit Republic and its war against Spain and Portugal.'' These events undermined the reputation of the Jesuits in Europe, laying the ground for their expulsion.

When Fernando VI died in 1759, the new King, Carlos III, immediately rejected the Treaty as very detrimental for Spanish interests, as Spain had surrendered a big territory for a small settlement that was never paid. In 1761, he obtained from Portugal the annulment of the Treaty. But the next year Spain was forced to enter the Seven Years War in support of France against England. Since Portugal was allied to England, Pedro Ceballos once more conquered Colonia de Sacramento. However since France and Spain lost the war, at the Treaty of Paris in 1763, for the third time Sacramento had to be returned to Portugal, although the area of Seven Villages was recovered. The Indians once more started to return to their lands, but the prosperity of the region had been greatly affected. The final straw was the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1767. Although an attempt was made to preserve their system, the Crown administrators proved less capable and more corrupt than the Jesuits, and had troubles with the Indians, leading to the ruin of the former Jesuit Reductions system in Paraguay.

Furthermore, for the first time since the separation of Portugal, relations between the Iberians became excellent until Napoleon interfered.

	#-#Don Pedro Téllez Girón, third Duke of Osuna, was married to a granddaughter of Hernando Cortés. He was made Viceroy of Sicily in 1606, after good military services in Flanders. He was in this post for 10 years, winning the appreciation of the Sicilians for ending the reign of the bandits in the island, and creating a very efficient naval squadron that halted the attacks by Ottoman and Barbary coast pirates, assaulting in several occasions their nests. His protegee, the immortal writer Francisco de Quevedo, acted as his agent in the court of Madrid, and as his spy in Italy. In 1616 he was named Viceroy of Naples. By then, his naval squadron, partly financed from his own money and partly from the corso, and commanded by Francisco de Ribera was extremely efficient, as demonstrated by defeating a much larger Ottoman fleet at the battle of Cape Khelidonia in Antalya. This battle is remembered as the first clash between a fleet of only galleons (Ribera's 6 warships) against a fleet of only galleys (the Ottoman's 55 galleys). In total Osuna had at his service 20 galleys, 20 galleons and 30 smaller ships, that did not cost Spain a single ducat. The previous year, Venice had started the war of Gradisca, also known as Uskok war, against the Austrian Habsburgs, and was also supporting with troops the attempt of the Duke of Savoy at seizing the Marquisate of Mantua and Montferrat from the Gonzaga, allies of Spain. Don Pedro de Toledo, Marquis of Villafranca and Viceroy of Milan, defeated Charles Emmanuel of Savoy with the help of Osuna and the peace of January 1617 restored the original situation, but Osuna wanted to punish Venice for her anti-Spanish stance, and requested from the King of Spain permission to send his naval squadron to the Adriatic. In December 1616, Felipe III authorised the action on the condition of secrecy, and the flag displayed was Osuna's personal flag. During the 1617 season, Osuna's fleet plundered the Venetian traffic and raided the islands in the Adriatic. The Venetians, unable to stop him, loudly protested in Madrid, but although the King publicly repudiated the Viceroy's acts, he did nothing to end the attacks. With the end of the season, the fleet returned to Naples.

	#-#In 1618, Osuna was accused of being behind an attempt of overthrowing the Venetian government. Three hundred French and Spaniards at the service of Venice were abruptly executed without explanation, and a rumor started that the Spaniards were trying to take over the Republic. A hunt for foreigners overtook the city, and Quevedo narrowly escaped disguised as a beggar. The Spanish ambassador, Alonso de la Cueva, Marquis of Bedmar, had to leave Venice. Whether the conspiracy was true or an invention of the Council of Ten, the feared security agency of Venice, is still debated, as no convincing evidence was produced. In any case the star of Osuna was declining, and was going to drag Quevedo with him. His political enemies in Naples recruited the help of St. Lawrence of Brindisi, who spoke to the King of Spain against him, and caused Osuna to lose the royal favor. When he was substituted and recalled to Madrid in March 1620, he obeyed. He was then accused of many charges, some of them ridiculous for a Great of Spain, and his vigorous defence had a good chance of having his charges dismissed if not being reinstated as Viceroy, when Felipe III died. The new government of Felipe IV prosecuted the followers of previous minister Lerma, and Osuna died in confinement in September 1624 without having been proven guilty of any crime. Francisco de Quevedo also suffered from prison and exile for his relation with Osuna, but he never abandoned him, and wrote many warm verses about his achievements, including his epitaph. It was not long before Naples and Sicily were again infested by Barbary coast pirates.

He decided upon a general policy to return the favor to the Dutch that the Spanish had so long enjoyed by destroying the Dutch fishing fleets and attacking Dutch shipping by commissioning privateers, primarily from the port of Dunquerque in Flanders. While the new ships were moderately successful, the ''guerre de course'' was spectacularly successful. Records are fragmentary, but between 1629 and 1638 Dunkirker privateers averaged almost 200 Dutch ships captured each year.

Dutch presence in the island, and piracy, moved the governor of Philippines to send another expedition under command of Antonio Carreño Valdés in 1626. They founded two forts at Tamsui and Keelung in the Northern part of the island. But their missionary and military work came to an end when the new governor of Philippines decided, in 1635, to stop supporting the colony. The governor of Formosa, Gonzalo Portillo, decided to stay despite lack of support, but diseases and confrontations with natives reduced the size of the colony, and in 1638 Tamsui had to be abandoned. The Dutch governor, Paulus Traudenius, conscious of their weakness, showed up with an army at Keelung in 1642, and the remaining Spaniards and Philippinos agreed to leave.

	#-#From the outset of the formation of Spain, Castile was to shoulder the principal burden of the Crown's finances. This in large part was due to the mistrusting nature of the other kingdoms of the monarchy, who were keen to protect their traditional customs and privileges. The other kingdoms had legitimate fears that the Castilian dominated government wished to abolish their traditional laws leading the to be wary of providing financial assistance to the Crown's schemes. By the time of Félipe IV, the Castilian economy was in dire straits and was unable to provide the money and manpower so badly needed by the Crown. Conde Duque Olivares envisioned a strong monarchy that would abolish provincial laws and liberties to establish a unified state. Olivares recognized that such a state could not be achieved in a day but believed small steps should be taken to set the process in motion. In 1624, he proposed a sort of military cooperation between the different provinces, by which the defense of the Spanish Empire would be spread equally amongst the kingdoms. Unfortunately, the Cortes of Aragon, Valencia, and Catalonia, held in the spring of 1626 were even more unenthusiastic about the scheme that Olivares had feared. The Catalans saw the proposal as yet another move in the long standing Castilian conspiracy to steal their liberties. Olivares's scheme was not without small success, as although they rejected his military proposal, the Cortes of Aragon and Valencia were convinced to make annual financial contributions to the Crown.

But in 1635 the Emperor and the German princes stipulated a peace treaty in Prague, with which the Protestant rulers were allowed to retain secularized bishoprics held by them in 1627, the enforcement of the Edict of Restitution was delayed for 40 years, the armies of the Emperor and of the German states were reunited to one imperial army and the German princes were forbidden to have alliances between them or with foreign powers. Since this treaty acknowledged the authority of the Habsburg party in the Empire and subsequently it renewed the threat for France of being surrounded at her borders, Cardinal Richelieu decided it was the moment for France to enter a preventive war against Spain and Austria.

It was supposedly introduced to european medicine in 1640 by the countess of Chinchón, even before botanists had identified and named the species of tree. Quinine bark was used by the jesuits in South America very early in its history and due to the influence of the Company of Jesus, the newly named 'Jesuit's powder' became known all over Europe. Throughout the mid-1600s to mid-1800s quinine bark was the primary treatment for malaria and evidenced remarkable results.

Spain, a small, poor country had been able to build and defend a huge empire. Basing her military success in the army reforms introduced during the war of Granada and the wars of Italy, and financing her never ending wars with the apparently unlimited precious metals from her American conquests, Spain was able to expand in Italy, and defend the troublesome inheritance of the Spanish Habsburgs. But by mid-seventeen century, the Spanish demography simply gave up. The wool crisis affected the shepherds, the main source of soldiers. The exhausted fields of Spain, ineffectually laboured by impoverished serfs, resulted in continuous crop failures, recurrent famines and terrible pestilences from the beginning of the century, that together with the expulsion of the Moors, significantly reduced the size of the population. The scarcity of soldiers was such that anybody taller than 150 cm was accepted, when previously nobody shorter than 170 cm could form in the famous Tercios. The Spanish empire was also weighed down by mismanagement, due to the lack of an educated middleclass to provide competent administrators, as a result of the obsession of the Spanish society with racial purity which glorified the idle nobility, while dismissing merchants and artisans. Spain would be forced to concede defeat in the peace of the Pyrenees, and to accept the independence of Portugal and the Netherlands. France was acknowledged as the new continental power. Instead of reacting to correct the root of her problems, Spain would entrench in defending her diminishing empire, entering a decline that will culminate in the loss of her European possessions after the war of the Spanish succession.

	#-#The Pueblo people of New Mexico had accepted Spanish domination because of the protection they awarded against nomadic Navajo and Apache raids. However there was religious friction due to Franciscan pressure to the Pueblo to abandon their Pagan beliefs. In 1670, a great drought brought famine and Apache attacks on such a scale that the Spanish soldiers could not cope. Unsatisfied with the Spanish inability to feed and protect them, the Pueblo Indians turned to their old gods, provoking a repressive wave from the Franciscans. In 1675, 47 medicine-men were arrested on charges of witchcraft, and three of them were hanged. The Pueblo uproar for the events coincided with most of the soldiers being away fighting the Apache, so the rest of the medicine-men had to be released, between them one named Popé. Later, when fugitive from murder accusations, Popé took refuge in Taos and prepared a revolt. On August 10, 1680 Popé directed the uprising of the Pueblo, killing 18 Franciscan priests, and over 380 Spaniards between men, women and children. The survivors took refuge in Santa Fe, and when besieged, escaped to El Paso. Until his death in 1688, Popé ruled the Pueblo with an iron fist, trying to erase any sign of Europeans. Under penalty of death, the Pueblo Indians had to destroy all signs of Catholic religion and Spanish culture, including the killing of Spanish imported livestock and burning of fruit trees, and they were forbidden from growing barley or wheat.

Besides nobody believed there was anything of value there except the pearls in the Sea of Cortes that were regularly fished by expeditions. In 1677, Carlos II ordered a new expedition that, under command of Isidoro Atondo, departed Sinaloa (Mazatlan) in 1683. In the expedition were three Jesuits, one of them Father Eusebio Francisco Kino from Trent. After three years the expedition returned. Father Kino then convinced Father Juan María de Salvatierra to return and they obtained permission from the Viceroy in 1697. They founded the mission of Loreto, now La Paz, in the Southern tip of the peninsula. The new King, Felipe V ordered in 1703 the establishment of military forts to protect the growing number of Jesuit missions in Baja California that in 1766 reached the number of fourteen with the last one near the border between Baja and Alta California. However, life in the missions was difficult, and they were sustained by donations from Mexico, as they received very little official help. Meanwhile Father Kino founded numerous missions in Sonora and Arizona.

This power struggle plus a prolonged drought and increased Apache attacks weakened the Pueblo and prepared the stage for the Spanish return. In July 1692, Diego de Vargas Zapata, recently appointed Governor of New Mexico, arrived with less than 50 soldiers. Through skillful diplomacy, he was able to entice the far more numerous and fortified Pueblo Indians in Santa Fe to surrender without firing a shot. The Spanish conceded a measure of freedom of religion and culture to the Pueblo Indians, granting large portions of land to the different Pueblos and appointing public defenders to protect the Indian rights at Spanish courts. A second uprising in 1696 that resulted in the death of 5 missionaries and 21 Spaniards had to be put down with more violence, but New Mexico was essentially reconquered by the end of the century.

However with the start of the war and the arrival of the French troops, and with the proclamation of Charles Habsburg as King in Vienna, his supporters (Austracists), were ready to change sides. Although there were supporters for both monarchs in all regions of Spain, the disenchantment with the Habsburg rule and the admiration for the French centralized model was higher in the former Kingdom of Castile, while in the former Kingdom of Aragon, besides the opposite sentiment, there was a profound hatred of the French for the loss of the Roselló and the bombardment of Barcelona by the French fleet a few years before. The arrival of the Archduke to the coasts of Valencia raised most of the province in his favor, and after the conquest of Barcelona by the English troops, and with the Archduke Charles in the city, most of Catalonia declared her support for him, and he was proclaimed King by the parliament on November 7, 1705.

	#-#The Spanish Habsburgs, kept the medieval system of Spanish Kingdoms. Each Kingdom, as well as other regions and cities, kept different laws and taxation system. The old Kingdom of Castile was the one that allowed more control to the King, and was the one that in a larger measure paid the price of maintaining the Spanish empire against its enemies. Less than a year after Felipe V was crowned King of Spain, Austria, England, and Holland decided to contest his succession. The ArchDuke Charles Habsburg, the candidate of the coalition, offered the former Kingdom of Aragon to swear and maintain their privileges. That, together with the hatred of the French for the loss of Rousillon, took first Valencia and Catalonia and later the rest of the Crown of Aragon to rise against their King and proclaim Charles as the new King. For the Spaniards it was a civil war between two models of state, the centralized France and the decentralized Austria. Even before the civil war was over, Felipe issued in the already recovered regions of Aragon and Valencia the decrees of Nueva Planta in 1707. The decrees suppressed the medieval kingdoms by abolishing their special laws and parliaments. This move towards centralization allowed for the imposition of a uniform tax system that greatly increased the Crown revenue. The Castilian language was also made official as the Spanish language. Other regions of Spain that kept their loyalty to the King were allowed to keep their privileges. The Catalans saw what was awaiting for them if they were defeated, increasing their determination to fight till the end.

Only the war in Spain seemed favorable to the Bourbons, but Louis XIV was ready to abandon his grandson in exchange for peace. But the allies were frustrated by their inability to impose the Archduke on the Spaniards, and surprised by their stern resistance, and went too far in their conditions demanding that Louis should remove his own grandson from the throne of Spain by force. This was a humiliation too big to endure, and Louis understood that he was negotiating from a position of weakness and decided to break the negotiations and renew the fight. Time would prove him right, as dissensions were already dividing the allies as the French threat receded. The Dutch and the Austrians were already at odds over the Spanish Netherlands, and the Austrians were seeing as not doing their part, occupied with the Hungarian revolt. The turning point was the unexpected death of Emperor Joseph I, at 33 years of age in April 1711. While Charles left Spain and went to Vienna to be elected emperor, the allies were not ready to reconstruct the empire of Charles V, and England immediately started peace negotiations with France without informing the Dutch or Austria.

	#-#The Spanish war of succession was also slow to end. Since Spain and Austria had not settled the issue and it was impossible to reach an agreement between all participants, it was decided that separate peace treaties between the parties would end the war. This decision was very damaging to Spain that was left with very little negotiating power once France left the war, and that was left at the hands of a foreign King whose main interest was to win the crown of Spain and had little interest in maintaining the Spanish possessions. The series of treaties received the name of Peace of Utrecht. Spain signed a treaty with England on July 13, ceding Gibraltar and Minorca, and a monopoly on slave trade for the next 30 years. The treaty with Savoy on August 13 ceded the island of Sicily, later exchanged by Sardinia with Austria, in exchange for the renunciation of Victor Amadeus II to any right to the crown of Spain. The peace treaty with the United provinces had to wait until June 26, 1714, and that with Portugal to February 1715, but both had little consequence. However the war against Austria, now favorable to Spain, continued with the reconquest of Sardinia in 1717 and an attack on Sicily in 1718, until a quadruple alliance was formed by France, England, Netherlands and Austria forcing Spain to accept the loss of Naples, Sicily, Sardinia and Parma at the treaty of the Hague on February 17, 1720 sealing the peace between Austria and Spain. At the Peace of Utrecht, Felipe, as King of Spain, renounced his right to the crown of France, and Charles renounced the crown of Spain. During the war of Polish succession, Felipe will finally be able to recover Naples and Sicily from Austria.

In March the empress left Barcelona, leaving Stahrenberg to reach an agreement with Felipe, and after surrendering Tarragona, the Austrians left. On the 9th of July 1713, with the Bourbon armies surrounding Barcelona, the three arms of the Barcelona courts voted on what to do. The military and ecclesiastic branches voted at first to come to terms, but in the popular arm, representing the third state, war was decided by 78 to 45 votes, forcing a turn of the tide for an all-out resistance. With numerous casualties on both sides, the Bourbon armies reconquered Barcelona on September 11, 1714. But the war would not end until June 13, 1715, when the 1000 Austrian garrison surrendered the island of Mallorca. Felipe V became the first King of Spain, instead of King of Castile and Aragon. Since his triumph was due to the loyalty of the Castilians, the coat of arms of Castile and the numbering of her Kings became those of Spain.

He alleged a desire to dedicate to religious works, but the death in the previous month of the Duke of Orleans, regent and heir to the throne of France had opened his possibility of inheriting the Kingdom of France from his sickly nephew, as he was the grandson of Louis XIV. By virtue of the will of Carlos II and the Peace of Utrecht, he could not rule both France and Spain, but he had not abdicated of his personal rights to the crown of France. A month later, on the 9th of February, his son Louis was crowned as King of Spain. He was 17 years old and childish, despite being already married. His court in Madrid was supervised by his father from the palace of La Granja de San Ildefonso, not far from the capital. But his rule was not to bear any consequence and was called the lightning rule, as he soon fell sick of smallpox, the same disease that exterminated the family of his cousin Louis XV of France. Luis died the 31 of August, 1724, seven months after becoming King. He was called the Well-Beloved because his very young wife cared for him during his disease despite the considerable risk to her own life. His brother Fernando was his heir, but his father Felipe illegally retook the crown, given that Louis XV of France recovered and that his second wife Isabel de Farnesio wanted to be Queen, and nobody disputed his right. But the second rule of Felipe V was worse than the first, as he was affected by a progressive mental disease, and his wife, Duchess and heir of Parma, involved Spain in the recovery of the Italian territories for her sons. Felipe V renounced to his rights to the French throne in 1725.

He hoped in this way to secure Mantua for the elder son, Don Carlos, who, already Duke of Parma as Carlo I, had also the expectation of Tuscany and to give the Kingdoms of Naples and Sicily to the younger son, Don Felipe. Since Austria was fighting on several fronts on the Rhine against France and on Lombardia against Savoy, Spain easily conquered Naples and Sicily which Austria had previously occupied during the war of Spanish succession. In 1735 the peace treaty that followed the war of Polish succession established that Felipe's son Carlos (later Charles III of Spain) should give up the duchy of Parma, which he had inherited in 1731 as descent of the Farnese family through his mother, Elisabetta Farnese, Queen of Spain and any claim to Tuscany, given to the Duke of Lorraine after Gian Gastone, the last of the Medicis, died. In exchange for that, Don Carlos was confirmed the possession of his conquests in Southern Italy. On 3 October 1735 Don Carlos, named Carlo VII King of Naples and Carlo V King of Sicily, established the cadet line of the Spanish House of Bourbons in the Kingdoms of Naples and Sicily (renamed Kingdom of Two Sicilies after 1815).

With the end of the Ghaznavid empire, the Romanies were pushed Westward through Turkish lands while growing in numbers, arriving to the Byzantine empire in the XII century. Soon the Ottomans pushed them further West and they entered the Balkans during the XIV century, were large numbers established. Many continued further West arriving to Western Europe at the beginning of the XV century. In Spain they are first recorded in 1420. As a curiosity, four Gypsies accompanied Columbus on his third voyage to the New World. Despite their European migration, and due to their own ignorance about their origins, they were though to come from Egypt, and they were called Gypsies (from Egyptians). Their nomadic ways were not well received, and they were prosecuted in every country, with specific laws that limited their movement, confined them to certain places, forced them to labor or even expelled them and in some cases executed them. Spain was not an exception in the repression of the Romanies, and one episode was especially terrible. In July 30, 1749, a great inquiry was started to identify the 'bad' Gypsies under the auspices of the marquis of Ensenada, minister of war, and Bishop Gaspar Vázquez Tablada, head of the Royal Council. 12,000 men, women and children were captured over the next days by the army, with the complicity of the Church which had retired the Gypsies the right to Holy Asylum two years before. They were separated, and some men taken to galleys, but most of them went to work as slaves in the shipyards of Cadiz, Cartagena and Ferrol, while the women were confined with their children in Valencia, Zaragoza and Sevilla, and forced to work in manufactories to support themselves, while their properties were seized and sold to reward those that participated in the prosecution. Some voices rose against the measure, and the government started releasing the old and the widows the same year. But it will not be until June 16, 1763 when the King will issue an indult, although the last ones will not be released until 1766, after having spent 17 years in confinement, ruined, their families broken.

	#-#It was a constant for Catholic monarchs to attempt to reduce the power of Rome in their countries. The justification for this struggle was the belief that the right to rule as monarch emanated directly from God, cornerstone of the Feudal system, but it was a fight for power and money. The means to achieve this independence from Rome were the regalias extracted from the Pope when the King was in a position of strength. The main regalias were the Royal patronage and the Royal exequatur. The exequatur allowed Kings to intervene in the application of Pontifical decisions, while the patronage gave them the right to decide in the distribution of Church money and fill vacant positions with their candidates. Fernando the Catholic, after a long struggle, obtained the control of the Church of the Americas, while Carlos I and Felipe II obtained important regalias. With Felipe V, the pro-Habsburg Church and the Bourbon King clashed to the point of reaching a suspension of relations in 1709. But the papacy of the eighteenth century was in no position to contest the growing independence of the temporal powers, while the revival of Spain under the Bourbons rendered hopeless any struggle against the resolve of the monarchs to regulate the internal affairs of the Kingdom. On January 11, 1753, Fernando VI and Pope Benedict XIV signed a concordat re-establishing relations. The Concordat of 1753 awarded the King of Spain Universal Royal Patronage, and reserved for the Pope the right to name only 52 ecclesiastical positions in the Spanish empire, none outside of Spain.

The peace that followed the conflict, provoked by the foreign opposition to the Pragmatic Sanction stated by the former Emperor Charles VI and ended with the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, resulted in a well defined rivalry between major European powers forming essentially two main political formations: the alliance of the socalled 'Bourbon family pact' (France, Spain, Naples and the latest Parma, all with members of the same House of Bourbons) with Prussia and the alliance between Austria, Russia and England. Disappointed by England's interested approaches to the emerging power of Prussia wich led to the Convention of Westminster, a treaty with which both countries would avoid any foreign military presence or access in the German territories, Austria strengthened her political ties with Saxony, Russia and Sweden and started new diplomatic handlings with France, traditionally an arch-enemy of the Habsburgs since the old dispute over the Burgundian inheritance but for sure the most powerful antagonist to the rising British colonial empire. And an alliance with France would also mean the support of Spain and the Bourbon Italian monarchies. That diplomatic move would lead to a huge world conflict fought in the years between 1756 and 1763: the socalled 'Seven Years War'.

Indeed brigands were using the cloaks to hide weapons, and the hats to hide their identity. But for the populace of Madrid, it was the last straw from the hated Italian ministers, made responsible for the price crisis, and they riotted destroying the street lamps recently installed. They requested from the King the reduction of bread price and the expulsion of Esquilache. The King, surprised by the revolt, but seeing that his authority was not questioned, agreed to their demands. Esquilache went back to Sicily, and was years later named ambassador in Venice. However the King used the change of administration to introduce the Spanish reformists and oust the anti-reformists. Pedro Pablo Abarca, count of Aranda, became the Spanish prime minister. Aranda, took a different approach to the problem. He convinced the nobility to change their outfit, and decreed that the official executioner would dress a long cloak and wide rim hat, and soon everybody stopped using them.

In 70 years the Jesuits had created 20 villages and 18 missions, although four were closed due to plagues. The Franciscans arrived with the idea of expanding north, and unlike the Jesuits, had full support of the Crown, because there was news of the arrival of the Russians to the coasts of California. Fray Junípero founded the mission of San Diego the next year, Monterrey in 1770, and San Francisco in 1776. Soon there were nine Franciscan missions in Alta California thanks to the untiring priests, incorporating a big territory to the crown of Spain. Around the missions soon cities started to grow, and colonists from Spain arrived.

	#-#The prestige gained at Lepanto, allowed the Mediterranean galley fleets of Spain to survive past their usefulness. To man them, the Spanish Justice automatically exchanged the death penalty for 10 years as a galley conscript forming part of the chusma (rowing gang). Both penalties were equivalent, as nobody could survive ten years as a galley oarsman due to the appalling conditions. Lesser crimes could net the offender with a minimum of two years service. Already in mid 1600s, the Navy High Command started to reject the use of galleys in combat as they simply could not face a ship of the line and survive. However the Justice Department demanded their use as floating labor prisons for their supposed deterrent effect on crime. When the decadent Spanish Navy was reorganized by the Marquis of Ensenada and converted back into a first rate Navy, it was clear that the remaining galleys had to be disposed of, and in the Royal decree of March 12, 1771 it was ordered that the punishment in galleys had to be exchanged by forced labor in the Shipyards. But the Justice Department would still have it their way, and the decree was suspended in 1785 with the galley conscription restored. The Navy then decided to stop maintaining the existing galleys and did not build any new one, so in a few years they were all decommissioned, and a new Royal decree on December 30, 1803 finally abolished the galley punishment for lack of galleys. After more than three thousand years reigning in the Mediterranean, the galleys were finally gone.

They were a branch of the Shoshone, and were the first native nation to use extensively the horse that made the buffalo culture possible. Besides hunting and trading, they also depredated all the rest of the Indian tribes and Spaniards, driving the Apache southward and the Ute westward. They mounted regular large scale raids that stole just about every horse and mule in New Mexico and Northern Mexico, and put a good dent in the available supply in Texas. They also captured women and children as slaves. When the Spaniards inquired about their name to the Ute, the answer was Kohmahts (those who are against us), interpreted by the Spaniards as Comanche. In the 1770s the Jupe Comanche were leaded by a charismatic chieftain, Cuerno Verde (Greenhorn), and his attacks put the Spanish frontier at the brink of collapse. Juan Bautista de Anza, had been made Governor of New Mexico after his famous land expedition to Monterey (California), and he understood that peace with the Comanche could not be achieved unless Cuerno Verde was defeated. He led an expedition in 1779 with 600 soldiers, militia and Pueblo Indians. He was later joined by 200 Ute and Apache against the common enemy. After a surprise attack from the North, the Spaniards killed Cuerno Verde and 50 comanche warriors. With his death the Comanche were ready to sign a peace with Spain, but were still at war with the Ute. Anza mediated between the Ute and the Comanche and finally achieved a permanent peace treaty between the Comanche and Spain and the Ute in 1786. This peace treaty would last until the end of the Spanish presence in North America.

Louis XVI, King of the French, saw in a war failure the possibility to restore absolutism. But the dissolution of the Ancien Régime in France alarmed all the European royal courts fearing that the French Jacobinism would have spread in the whole continent and provoked deep destabilization inside their own absolutist government systems.

At the peace of Basilea in 1795, Spain ceded the island of Santo Domingo to France and Godoy was given the title of Prince of Peace. At the first treaty of San Ildefonso in 1796 between France and Spain, Godoy turned the Spanish foreign policy into French hands, leading to a permanent confrontation with England of catastrophic consequences. Despite his efforts he failed to improve the economy. Finally his submission to Napoléon will lead to the invasion of Spain, and the forced abdication of Carlos IV.

Also many urban properties were in the hands of conventual orders. As a result, tax income was low. The liberals proposed a disentailment of these improductive properties, and the acute need for money during the war with Britain forced the approval of the measure. However it was a missed opportunity. The impoverished peasants could not afford the disentailed properties, and their communal lands were also taken out of their hands and sold. It only profited the bourgeoisie and rich nobles that bought the properties at a reduced price, and even the State was shortchanged by the corruption and by the subsidies that it had to pay to the Church as compensation. It also produced the irrecoverable loss of many books and cultural goods property of the Church. In the end the Spanish disentailments turned out to be another good idea with a bad implementation. Their social and economic effects were negligible, although they provided short term money for the state treasury.

Joao could not accept Napoléon's demands of ceding a quarter of his territory to Spain as a guarantee, and so the war became inevitable. On May 20, 1801, Godoy invaded Portugal from three points, and in nine days completely defeated the Portuguese army, before the French army sent to participate in the campaign could cross Spain. Godoy sent a branch of an orange tree from the moat of Elvas to his Queen and lover, and hence the name of the war. But Carlos IV had no intention of leaving Portugal in the hands of Napoléon, and against his instructions, signed the treaty of Badajoz with Joao. It was a very favorable treaty for Portugal, who had to pay indemnities to France, close her ports to British ships, cede a small part of the Guiana to France, and the small town of Olivenza to Spain. The treaty was signed on the 8th of June, but dated on the 6th, so Carlos could ignore Napoléon's instructions received on the 7th. Napoléon was furious and did not ratify the treaty until the 29th of September.

Although it is generally considered to be the first directly political act of the Spanish people, it is known that many of Ferdinand's supporters took part in inciting the revolt. The mutiny was initially directed towards the Prime Minister, Manuel de Godoy. Godoy, a former member of the Royal Guard, was highly unpopular with both the Spanish peasants and the nobles. The people were upset at his ambitious nature, his flirting with many women of the court, and his willingness to sign nationally detrimental treaties with France against Great Britain. The nobles were also annoyed at the fact that Godoy had attained enormous power without belonging to their social stratum. Another important factor was the economic crisis that was affecting the country, heightened after Spain lost the core of its navy at Trafalgar in 1805, all but crippling its trade with the American colonies. This caused food shortages and damaged industrial production. Ultimately, the King and Godoy had allowed Napoléon's troops to cross Spain in order to attack Portugal, which wouldn't adhere to the Emperor's embargo on Great Britain. This move was extremely unpopular with the Spanish people, who saw the entry as an invasion, which it would soon become. The French troops rapidly occupied important cities like San Sebastián, Pamplona and Barcelona, thus causing a strong sentiment against the French and Godoy. The uprising itself occurred on March 17th, 1808 in the town of Aranjuez, about 48 km south of Madrid. Members of popular classes, soldiers and peasants assaulted Godoy's residence and captured him, and the King was forced to dismiss him. Two days later, the court forced Charles IV to abdicate and give the throne to his son and rival, Ferdinand VII.

Thus, under the false pretence of solving the problem, the Emperor invited both Charles IV and Ferdinand VII to Bayonne in the south of France. Both monarchs were afraid of the Emperor's power and thought it prudent to accept the invitation. However, once in Bayonne, Napoléon forced both Charles and Ferdinand to renounce the throne of Spain and grant it to himself. The Emperor then named his brother Joseph as King of Spain and dispatched him to Madrid at the head of a large French army, in order to establish the new dynasty and invade Portugal. Joseph would, however, leave Spain for good in May 1812, leaving his few remaining supporters, the ''afrancesados,'' to their fate. This episode is known as the Abdications of Bayonne, and paved the way for five years of sporadic, impractical and highly disputed Napoleonic rule in Spain.

The New Republic and its ideas undermined the 'Old Order' that existed in most European countries. Those several alliances were set up to restore the Bourbons to the French Throne, crush the revolution and get Europe back to normal again. This succeeded in 1814 and again in 1815 when foreign armies brought Louis XVIII on the throne. Louis XVIII was the brother of the Executed King Louis of France and in early life was known as the Comte de Provence. He remained in Paris after the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789 but escaped to Belgium two years later. After King Louis' execution in 1793 he proclaimed himself regent, and after the death of his brother's heir in 1795, he took the title Louis XVIII. He lived as an exile in various European countries until he became King after Napoléon's first abdication in 1814. On Napoléon's return to power in 1815, however, Louis again fled to Belgium

	#-#In the war of Polish succession Felipe V of Spain supported France in her fight against Austria and Russia in order to make the French candidate to be elected as King of Poland. He hoped in this way to secure Mantua for the elder son, Don Carlos, who, already Duke of Parma as Carlo I, had also the expectation of Tuscany and to give the Kingdoms of Naples and Sicily to the younger son, Don Felipe. Since Austria was fighting on several fronts on the Rhine against France and on Lombardia against Savoy, Spain easily conquered Naples and Sicily which Austria had previously occupied during the war of Spanish succession. In 1735 the peace treaty that followed the war of Polish succession established that Felipe's son Carlos (later Charles III of Spain) should give up the duchy of Parma, which he had inherited in 1731 as descent of the Farnese family through his mother, Elisabetta Farnese, Queen of Spain and any claim to Tuscany, given to the Duke of Lorraine after Gian Gastone, the last of the Medicis, died. In exchange for that, Don Carlos was confirmed the possession of his conquests in Southern Italy. On 3 October 1735 Don Carlos, named Carlo VII King of Naples and Carlo V King of Sicily, established the cadet line of the Spanish House of Bourbons in the Kingdoms of Naples and Sicily (renamed Kingdom of Two Sicilies after 1815).
