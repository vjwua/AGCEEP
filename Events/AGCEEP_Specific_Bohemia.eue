	#-#Religious dissent in Bohemia, caused by the low moral state of the clergy and the great schism, had grown slowly in the 14th century. It found a leading figure in Jan Hus, a priest and professor of theology at the university of Prague. Influenced by the teachings of John Wyclif, he developed several reformatory demands, including the administration of the communion in both kinds to all church members, a much stricter adhesion to the bible and the Commandments, a radical reformation of the clergy and the abolition of Papal infallibility. These views were attacked as heretic by the University of Prague in 1403, however since he enjoyed the protection of the King he could continue to spread them and even became rector of the university. In 1410, when his influence had grown significantly and he had gathered already a large amount of followers, the Archbishop of Prague excommunicated him, which did not stop him from teaching his ideas and increasing what had soon become a popular movement, though. In 1414 he was summoned to the Council of Constance to justify his views, having been guaranteed safe-conduct by Emperor Sigismund. Ignoring this safe-conduct, the Council condemned him as a heretic and had him burned at the stake. Thereby he became a martyr for the Bohemians and his views became even more popular.

	#-#A broken man, Vaclav IV died of a second stroke on August 16th 1419. His brother, Emperor Sigismund, immediately claimed the throne and was acknowledged as rightful heir by the crown lands and by the remaining catholics in Bohemia, mostly in the crown lands Moravia, Silesia and Lusatia where there still was a catholic majority, however the Hussites who at that time already dominated most of Bohemia proper refused to accept him, fearing suppression of their faith and despising him for his betrayal of Jan Hus that led to his execution at the stake in 1415. Armed resistance against royal authority and violence against Romanists, especially Germans, began almost immediately. Queen Sophia, widow of Vaclav, first acted as regent in Bohemia and tried to maintain at least a bit of central authority in Prague and to secure the throne for her brother-in-law, however she was opposed by the Hussites in Prague and had few effective control over Bohemia. On November 13th, she had to conclude a truce with the citizens of Prague, having failed to suppress them with hired mercenaries, basically acknowledging that the Hussite movement had become impossible to control, let alone suppress it. For almost two decades large parts of Bohemia would be in Hussite hands.

It is evident that the radicals among them need to be persecuted harshly, but there are also, especially among the nobility, lots of moderates, the so-called Utraquists. If we decide to suppress them as well, we would cleanse Bohemia completely from heresy and strengthen the authority of the catholic King, on the other hand, this might make many Hussites leave the country which would weaken the country's military and economic strength substantially. Therefore some of the King's advisors advocate giving certain concessions to the Romanists.

This diet attempted to establish an effective administration of the Kingdom for as long as its King was a child. It was decreed that the members of the estates were to be divided into three bodies, the 'curiae', representing the nobles, the knights and the towns - who were granted such a big deal of influence for the first time - that deliberated separately and only met for a final decision in which each of the three had one vote.

At that meeting, soon known as the 'Diet of St. Wenceslas', they finally managed to achieve a settlement regarding the issues that had been dividing Bohemia.

The three estates agreed to 'live together in friendly intercourse, as men belonging to the same country and race'.
