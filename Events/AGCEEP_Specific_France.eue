After 2 years and half of life, isolated and surrounded by the unfaithful Sforza, who in the meanwhile and with the support of Venice turned against the city of Milan aiming at the ducal throne, the Ambrosian Republic eventually ceased to exist. Brought to severe famine the citizenship of Milan was forced to surrender to the condottiero and accept him as their new Duke.

	#-#The medieval Inquisition tried a large number of witches, but collective witch-hunting was exclusively a modern phenomena. Individual maleficium (Latin for witchcraft) was not uncommon in many rural areas, but it wasn't until scholastic demonology related witches and Sabbaths (night meetings with strong conspiracy elements, including cannibalism, orgies and a sacred oath of loyalty to Satan himself) that societies started to get obsessed with the matter. This conspiracy paranoia can track its roots as far as to the first massacres of Jews and Lepers in the High Middle Ages, when thousands were slaughtered by defeated Crusaders and angry countrymen. But it's in the early 15th century when demonological theories will become fully accepted by the upper classes. The Councils of Constance and Basel are considered to be the first public space in which these concepts, maleficium and Sabbath were publicly related. The work of Johannes Nider (1380-1438), The Formicarius (The Anthill), was a masterpiece of scholastic demonology and marked a new era in witch-hunting. The work of Heinrich Kramer (1430-1505), Malleus Maleficarum (Hammer of the Wicked) was the first work that reaches widespread attention, and works as a inquisitorial manual for witch-hunters. But it's not the Church that tries the most in Modern Ages. On the contrary, civil courts are responsible for 85-90 percent of executions.	\n \nFrance is home to the very first conspiracy theories as early as the beginning of the 14th century. A powerful and centralized government was the only thing that stopped French towns from burning thousands of witches.

Margaret had desired to visit Louis XI, and her expectations of him were high, especially after she learned that he had been actively involved in Oxford's conspiracy against Edward IV, now King of England. The Queen and her son embarked for France. Landing in Brittany, the two were welcomed warmly by the Duke of Brittany. From there she met with her father, and after a brief stay caught Louis XI in Amboise. Margaret threw herself at Louis' feet and begged him for assistance against the Yorkist usurpers. After a subsequent meeting, Margaret agreed to surrender Calais to Louis in return for French soldiers and 20,000 francs to assist her against Yorkist controlled England.

Royal troops led by Louis met Charles's Burgundian army at Montlhery. The resulting battle left Burgundians masters of the field, but they suffered greater casualties. Thus, both sides claimed victory. However, Louis found himself besieged in Paris, and once the Burgundian and Breton troops presented a united front, Louis could do little but wait out the seige. In time, Louis was forced to agree to the rebels' demands. Thus, the King's brother, Charles Duke of Berry, exchanged his appanage in Berry for the rich Duchy of Normandy. Burgundy received the Somme towns and Charles Count of Charolais received the territories ceded to Jean Count of Etampes and Nevers. Louis XI would not be compensated for Somme towns, and by the terms of the Treaty was not entitled to repurchase the territory until after Charles' death. The Duke of Bourbon was made Lieutenant-General of all the provinces of central France. The Count of Saint-Pol was made Constable of France.

The French rebels took refuge in Nantes in the court of his friend, Duke François II, where he continued to intrigue against the French Regency and convince François to declare war on France. However, the great Barons of Brittany regarded Duke Louis II's arrival and subsequent entrenchment within François's council with contempt.

At Châteaubriant, the French proposed to join the Breton lords in ousting Louis II and his entourage from Brittany. The Treaty stipulated that the Breton barons would assist the royal troops to dislodge Louis of Orleans and his friends of the Duchy in exchange of the simple recognition of their rights.

The agreement will remain secret because based upon the formal reason that Galeazzo Maria, il Moro's brother and Duke Gian Galeazzo's father, who died assassinated in 1476, was already born when Francesco Sforza still had to proclaimed himself Duke of Milan. On 20 October 1494, soon after Gian Galeazzo died in his 'golden prison' in Pavia in mysterious circumstances (allegedly poisoned!), Ludovico il Moro, as the new proclaimed Duke of Milan by acclamation, revealed to have already obtained the imperial investiture of the duchy, a title which was never conceded to the Sforza family since his father Francesco seized power in Milan in 1450. But the main reasons for the concession were to be found in Maximilian's desperate need of money in order to keep the imperial lands under his control.

	#-#Charles VIII, King of France, was a throwback as he still lived lost in a world of chivalry. He clearly had a grand design, probably inspired by the Spanish Reconquista and the rise of the Ottoman Turks, of a crusade versus the infidels and the recapture of Jerusalem, the capital city of Christendom. He based his plan on a nebulous claim through the testament in which Charles IV Duke of Anjou bequeathed Louis XI, his cousin and Charles' father, the inheritance of Naples and the subsequent title of King of Sicily. His ambitions were well known to the Duke of Milan who, convinced to solve his problems with the King of Naples, sent his ambassadors, the Count of Belgioioso and the Count of Caiazzo, to speak to the great lords of the Royal Council of France about the legality of Charles VIII's claim to the Kingdom of Naples, about the weakness of the Neapolitan armies, and about the glory the conquest of Naples would bring to France. In the meanwhile some Neapolitan exiles in France, amongst them Antonello Sanseverino, who escaped the baronal persecutions in Naples in 1487, assured that the Neapolitan people would have agreed on a French intervention. Most of the great lords of the Royal Council were against an attack on Naples, seeing it as very expensive and very dangerous and argued that Charles VIII was too inexperienced to fight a war and that his advisors were weak and foolish to trust il Moro, known all over Italy for his treachery. But the young Charles VIII, who was carried away by a thirst for glory and a desire to conquer the Kingdom of Naples, paid very little attention to their arguments and heard instead the advice of his own advisors, many of them already corrupted by the money and promises of il Moro's emissaries with the lure of getting land and estates in the Kingdom of Naples and ecclesiastical positions from the Pope. Finally, after several days' debate, Charles VIII signed a secret agreement with il Moro's ambassadors, by which it was agreed that Charles VIII would send an army to invade the Kingdom of Naples and Milan would provide men, money and free passage. To have his hands free in Italy, Charles made ruinous pacts with all his neighbours, so they would not interfere. A large sum of money was given to Henry VII of England while the Roussillon was given to Ferdinand King of Aragon and the counties of Artois and Franche-Comté were ceded to Maximilian I King of the Romans and regent of Burgundy, thus sacrificing essential territories to the strategic defence of France for his chivalric dream.

He extracted a promise from the French King to respect the freedom of the city, but only in return for handing over some of the most important fortresses protecting Florentine territory. When the news of this arrangement reached the city, it aroused a great wave of anger and resentment. Piero, forgetting the lessons of his ancestors, had already made himself unpopular by his arrogance and his flaunting of his position. The consequence was an uprising that drove out Piero and his rule and restored a more popular government. The new government admitted the French to the city, and some tense negotiations took place, in which the Florentines feared that Charles would try to restore Piero and become their master. The determination of the citizens to resist these demands, by arms if need be, so impressed Charles that he did not press them, but departed leaving the city its freedom. He held on to the fortresses, including Pisa, which had thrown off Florentine rule at the approach of the French. To regain Pisa was a passion with Florence, and the hope of doing so with French help was one reason why Florence made an alliance with France and stuck to it faithfully during the next few years.

	#-#The presence of Charles VIII of France in the Kingdom of Naples scared the Italian princes, who had in a certain way permitted the French King to achieve his goal of settling there almost undisturbed. Venice and Florence were worried about a French hegemony in the peninsula. French military presence wasn't limited to Southern Italy but also to villages of Tuscany and the Papal States, which previously surrendered to Charles VIII in his march towards Naples, strategically located to grant the French military supply line. The Pope, who previously granted the French King military access through the Papal territories and consented his stay in Rome, felt in jeopardy as much as to refuse Charles VIII being proclaimed King of Naples. Also King Ferdinand of Aragon couldn't accept the French presence in a Kingdom where he instead, in spite of Alfons V's testament which assigned Naples to the other Trastamara branch, could be the one to have claims there. The position of Naples was also important for the Aragonese trading in the Mediterranean. The Duke of Milan, who decisively affected Charles VIII's decision to settle in Naples, was now alarmed by the presence of French reserve troops deployed in the county of Asti, very close to Milan and at the order of the Duke of Orléans, who had dynastical claims to the Milanese throne. So Venice, Milan, the Pope, Spain and even the Holy Roman Empire (so firmly opposed to the French expansionism in Italy as to join any Anti-French alliance available) consequently formed the Anti-French league in Venice on 31 March 1495. Florence preferred to stay out because of her internal problems caused by Charles VIII's passage and decided to support France instead. Having heard about those arrangements and fearing that the confederates would isolate his army in Italy, Charles VIII decided to return to France for reinforcements leaving his regent in Naples. He had to move his army quickly through the Apennines as to reach the Alps and then safety, but the presence of heavy artilleries and carriages transporting the big loot he accumulated across Italy, slowed his march down. Only at Fornovo on the Taro River, in the Po Valley, Charles VIII finally faced the army of the confederates. Despite having lost all the carriages, he managed to reach the Alps gaining from his expedition to Italy nothing but his army decimated by epidemies.

	#-#The French claim on the throne of Naples was unpopular with many of the Italian states, nevertheless, they were all cowed at first by the fierce conduct of war of the French army and by the powerful artillery Charles VIII had at disposal. However King Ferdinando of Naples sought the diplomatic way, asking Charles VIII for the renewal of the treaties he had previously stipulated with Louis XI and to eventually submit the controversy to the Pope's high decision. As a clear answer to that his ambassadors were just ordered to leave France immediately. Then Ferrante managed to reconcile with Pope Alexander VI and that made Ludovico Sforza so suspicious as to request again an immediate French intervention in the Kingdom of Naples. On 25 January 1494 Ferdinando died and his son Alfonso succeeded to the throne. The first successful Alfonso's political act was the stipulation of an alliance with Piero de' Medici and Pope Alexander VI who, fearing the French himself, legitimated him as the new King of Naples. Once the French King begun the invasion of Naples and without any withstand the Abruzzi preferred to show allegiance to the Charles VIII, while Alfonso didn't want to face the aggression and abdicated in favour of his son Ferrandino who, instead, arranged for resistance. While the French army did show its fierceness in Italy by slaughtering and pillaging the villages that didn't want to pay homage in their triumphal march towards Naples, no army seemed to be able to cope with the invaders and instead of opposing the French, deals were made as to avoid battle. Facing with a disbanding army and with a turmoil that broke out in the city of Naples, Ferrandino had no other choice than to flee and let the Kingdom to the invaders' mercy. On 22 february 1495 Charles VIII King of France entered the city of Naples distributing money to the populace who gave a warm welcome to the Valois. As a French diplomat, Philippe de Commynes, wrote in his Memoires, the French King took 4 months and 19 days only to go from Asti to Naples, an ambassador would take just a little less. Since Charles VIII didn't face any enemy army, it was said he had conquered Italy simply with 'wooden spurs' and a 'chalk' used to assign lodgings to his troops.

	#-#On 7 April 1498, upon Charles VIII's death at Amboise (he knocked his head while passing through a doorway in his going to see a game of real tennis), the throne passed to his cousin Louis of Orléans, who reigned as Louis XII of France. On his accession, he took the titles of Duke of Milan and King of Sicily, sending a shrounding chill through Italy, especially to Ludovico Sforza, who had seized Milan from his nephew Gian Galeazzo, and that upon his death, had seen his claim legitimized by Maximilian King of the Romans. Louis XII came to throne in France with the clear idea of avenging his previous defeat by Ludovico and make good his claim to Milan from his Visconti grandmother. Milan and her dependency, Genoa, were seen as the key to Italy. So Louis XII, preparing to make good his claim on Milan, wanted to enlist the help of the main Italian powers, to avoid the mistakes of his cousin Charles VIII. In the meanwhile the anti-Venetian sentiment had been running high, attempts were made by Italian ambassadors to poison the relationships between Venice and the Ottoman Empire and try to induce the latter to declare war to the former. It was clear that Venice could very well side with the French and that occurred with the stipulation of the treaty of Blois, where Venice would recognize French claims to Milan and in exchange for military support and money would receive the Milanese territories east of the Adda river. Louis then stipulated a peace treaty with Ferdinand of Spain and enforced the truce with Maximilian of Habsburg. He made also a pact with Pope Alexander VI: in exchange for a papal bull to annul his marriage to the crippled sister of late Charles VIII and marry Charles' widow, Anne of Brittany, the Pope's son, Cesare Borgia, received the duchy of Valentinois with the hand of Charlotte d'Albret, sister to the King of Navarre and a promise of French military support to form his own duchy in Romagna. After having secured his friendship with Philibert II of Savoy Louis XII crossed the Alps and assembled his powerful army in Asti, a small county in Piedmont that belonged to the House of Orléans as marriage dowry of Valentina Visconti, his grandmother. In the summer of 1499, the French army led by Gian Giacomo Trivulzio, a Milanese noble, invaded the duchy of Milan from West, in the meanwhile, a Venetian army attacked from East. Town after town surrendered and the Milanese armies disappeared. As soon as a revolt broke out in Milan, Ludovico left the city together with his family and his treasure. By September 1499 the French troops made their entrance in Milan warmly welcome by the population.

	#-#When in 1499 the French troops invaded Milan, Ludovico il Moro escaped to Innsbruck in Austria at the court of Maximilian I to ask his protection. Louis XII remained in Milan only a couple of months, then he made return to France and left Trivulzio there as his viceroy. But Trivulzio's way to administrate provoked deep Milanese resentments as much as to long for a Sforza's return and in January 1500, hearing that Sforza was assemblying troops to conquer Milan, an Anti-French revolt broke out in the city, the french troops were forced to abandon Milan except the garrison in Castello Sforzesco. In facts, with the gold he brought with, il Moro could hire mercenary troops and by February 1500 he made his entrance in Milan. After Milan, Sforza retook all the cities in the duchy and beyond Ticino River, where in Novara he had to face a French counterattack led by La Trémouille, also hiring Swiss mercenaries. The Swiss troops hired by il Moro, probably lured by the French gold and incited by their fellow-countrymen in the opposite camp refused to fight. 'The Duke's forces were composed of different races: German 'landsknechte', Burgundians who were commanded by the same Claude de Vauldray who had fought with the Good Knight in his first tournament, and Swiss mercenaries. There were bands of Swiss fighting on the side of the French, and those within the city declared that they would not fight against their fellow-countrymen in the other camp. They laid down their arms, and neither threat nor promise availed. Soon it was discovered that one of the gates of Novara had been opened by treachery, and that the French were entering the city. Then, as a last hope, Ludovico and his companions put on the dress of common soldiers and mixed with them in the ranks. But the unfortunate Duke was betrayed by one of the Swiss captains, who was put to death later by his own countrymen as a traitor.'(Bayard: The Good Knight Without Fear And Without Reproach, e-book by Christopher Hare) Ludovico Sforza was recognised and captured, then sent as prisoner to France where he miserably died, some years later, in the Castle of Loches, in Turenne. On 15 April 1500 The French troops made their second entrance in Milan.

Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba met more resistance in the siege of Taranto, defended by Federico's son Ferdinando. Ferdinando surrendered Taranto to Spain on March 1502, and Fernando of Aragon did not keep Cordoba's promise of personal freedom to him, asking Cordoba to send him to Spain. His father King Federico III had already ceded the Kingdom to Louis XII King of France, who in exchange for it, appointed him Duke of Anjou. Federico III will die in 1504 in France. In 1550 with the death of his son Ferdinando, who was taken captive in Spain, the line of the House of Trastamara Naples will be definitely extinct. But the Kings had neglected to properly divide the regions of the Kingdom, leaving the Principati, the Basilicata and the Capitanata between both parts unassigned. The French denied that Capitanata (a land on which both Apulia and Abruzzi depended for food and flock wintering) was part of Apulia arguing recent administrative usage, and refused to allow the commissaries of Spain to collect the tolls on migrating flocks as the treaty stipulated. Soon incidents were taking place and open war broke out in July 1502. But the lack of decision by the French to attack when they had the advantage, the skill of Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba and the delays of Louis in bringing reinforcements will see the French expelled from Naples in one year. Completely defeated in Naples by Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba, Louis XII of France agreed at Blois in October of 1505 to cede his rights over Naples to his relative Germaine de Foix on her marriage to Fernando of Aragon. After the battle of Cerignola on 28 April 1503 Gonzalo Fernández will be remembered as el Gran Capitán. He introduced many of the reforms that would change the way battles were fought for centuries, and lead to the creation of the Spanish Tercios, and also trained most of the next generation of Spanish commanders.

	#-#Perhaps a native of the Vermandois region of Picardy, Josquin Desprez was a singer at Milan Cathedral in 1459, remaining there until December 1472. By July 1474 he was one of the 'cantori di capella' in the chapel of Galeazzo Maria Sforza. Between 1476 and 1504 he passed into the service of Cardinal Ascanio Sforza, whom he probably accompanied in Rome in 1484. He then went to France and probably served Louis XII's court. Josquin's works gradually became known throughout western Europe and were regarded as models by many composers and theorists. Josquin was the greatest composer of the high Renaissance, the most varied in invention and the most profound in expression.

	#-#Since 1495, Venice had been holding the main ports of Apulia despite Aragonese claims to have them back. With the French invasion of Milan, Venice had acquired Milanese territories east of the Adda River, and upon the fall of Cesare Borgia had also acquired Rimini, Faenza and Ravenna, against the will of Pope Julius II. The Venetians also held Veneto and Friuli, on which Maximilian of Habsburg had imperial claims. In late 1507 Maximilian announced his intention to travel to Italy to receive the imperial investiture from the Pope himself, and in early 1508 he assembled a big army to escort him down to Rome. He requested free passage through Venetian territories, but was told that he would be allowed passage only without his army. Enraged at the answer, Maximilian attacked Venice, but this decision proved unwise: Venice not only routed the imperial army but also seized the imperial cities of Trieste, Gorz and Fiume. A second assault by a Tyrolean force several weeks later was an even greater failure, forcing Maximilian to conclude a humiliating three-year truce. With Pope Julius II's assent, Maximilian took the title of 'Emperor-elect', thus breaking the century-old custom that the Holy Roman Emperor had to be crowned by the Pope. Shortly afterward, Venice provided a pretext for war by appointing her own candidate to the vacant bishopric of Vicenza. The Emperor, the King of France and Ferdinand of Aragon gathered in Cambrai in December 1508 to sign a treaty which seemed to be a defensive alliance against the Turk. In reality they meant to form a league to attack Venice and deprive the Serenissima of most of her mainland territories. Pope Julius II, after a renewed Venetian refusal to give the Romagna lands back to the Papacy, ratified the treaty and at the same time proceeded to excommunicate all Venetian citizens. Ferrara and Mantua, each with separate claims to territories held by Venice, joined the league as well. In April 1509 military operations started, and a month later French troops decimated one of the two Venetian armies at the battle of Agnadello. Even though in August 1509 Venice managed to eliminate Mantua from the war, she still faced the collapse of her strategic position and had by February 24, 1510 to accept the papal demands on the cities she had occupied in Romagna. However, Pope Julius II was still not satisfied and demanded that the war be prosecuted until Venice conceded control over their church to the Pope and compensated him for his expenses. The Council of Ten had privately resolved that the terms had been accepted under duress and were therefore invalid, and that Venice should violate them at the earliest opportunity. This opportunity presented itself shortly afterward.

In the context of the wars of Italy, Spain and England were preparing the invasion of France across the Pyrenees, and Fernando requested guarantees of neutrality from Navarre. Catherine and Jean d'Albret, Kings of Navarre, entered an alliance with Louis XII at Blois in 1512. Fernando found out about the secret alliance, and quickly invaded Navarre, conquering all the Kingdom South of the Pyrenees before the summer was over. The Kings of Navarre placed themselves in the hands of France too late to gain her from Spain.

The siege of Pamplona was a complete failure, and with the arrival of the winter they suffered grave loses, retreating back to France in a difficult march across the Pyrenees. By the spring of 1513, the Spaniards had resisted the French attack in the Basque region and were the masters of Navarre.

Thence the decision to withdraw from Milan. Julius II recovered Ravenna, Bologna and the rest of the Romagna, while his commander, the Duke of Urbino, easily occupied Reggio and Modena, though Alfonso d'Este refused any settlement that would deprive him of Ferrara. After having chased out the French from Italy, the congress of allies which met at Mantua in August made over to the Pope Parma and Piacenza, to which he had at best a shadowy claim. The Emperor and Fernando would have been glad to give Milan to their grandson Charles but the Swiss were in possession and, supported by the Pope, made their will good. The duchy was given to Ercole Massimiliano Sforza, the elder son of Ludovico. The Venetian claims were left unsettled with Brescia still held out and the Swiss claiming Cremona and the Ghiara d'Adda for the duchy. And more, the Emperor demanded Vicenza and Verona. Florence, who in 1509 had ended her long war by the recovery of Pisa, was punished for her support of France by the restoration of the Medici. Entering Milan, Ercole Massimiliano Sforza received the keys to the city from the Swiss soldiers, who promised to protect the duchy of Milan and to help the Duke in sending to him all the troops he would need. The Duke granted them the acquisition of the ducal territories Ticino and Valtellina, the most important accesses to the Alpine passes. Genoa drew back its allegiance to the French King, who in 1506 harshly repressed a local rebellion that broke out owing to the decision taken by the French governor to grant privileges to the nobilty. But Julius II made also a treaty with his late ally, Maximilian, against Venice. The emperor was to support the Lateran council to oppose that one proclaimed by Louis XII in Pisa and to hand over Modena to the Pope, while Julius II was to join in compelling Venice to give up the fiefs which the Emperor claimed since Cambrai and to use on behalf of his new ally also the always convincing 'spiritual weapons'. When this treaty was made public, it had only the effect to drive Venice to side with France.

In the administration of the County of Burgundy (Franche-Comté) Margarete of Austria could rely upon the support of the Savoyard Mercurino da Gattinara, soon to be personal advisor of Charles V. In 1512 when the French troops were routed from Italy by the Swiss mercenaries in their retaking of Milan, Mercurino managed to stipulate an agreement with Louis XII, King of France, with which the county of Burgundy was to be considered as Burgundian imperial fief and 'neutralized territory' during war times. The treaty, whose terms were guaranteed by the Swiss, was reconfirmed by the new French King François Ier in 1522, thus avoiding Franche-Comté from being ravaged during the Italian Wars.

	#-#The French military campaign in Italy was at its low in 1513, Louis XII's attempt to recover Milan from the Swiss occupation turned to be a complete defeat with the routing French troops pursued by the Swiss into French territory. In order to recover international prestige, Louis XII had to recognize the Pope as the only chief of the Church and to abandon the schismatic council he established at Pisa and managed to make peace with England, with which he was at war, just before his death occurred early in 1515. His successor and nephew, François Ier of Valois Angoulême, self proclaiming 'duke of Milan' once on the throne of France, made clear to be intentioned to pursue what his uncle Louis XII had miserably failed, the conquest of Milan. Eager to seek revenge on the Swiss troops who routed the French army at Novara and profaned the Gaston de Foix's burial place in the Milanese Duomo, he assembled a big army and quickly moved to Italy through the unknown Col de l'Argentière so to avoid the practical Alpine passes already held by Swiss troops. The unexpected arrival of the French troops on an alternative road surprised the Swiss troops who preferred to fall back to Milan and wait for reinforcements. The way to Milan was clear but in order to avoid the necessity of besieging Milan itself, François Ier offered the Swiss a large sum to retire into their own country. Not having received their subsidies from the Pope and the King of Spain, the Swiss were about to accept his offer when a fresh corps of mercenaries descended into Italy. The French took position at Marignano (today's Melegnano) to face the attacking Swiss and there, in the evening of 13 and in the morning of 14 September 1515, a fierce battle, also known as the Battle of the Giants, was fought. In that battle, paused only at late night of the first day (during which the two armies stand facing each other awaiting the coming day and even François Ier and his gendarmes, forming the advanced line of the French army, remained all night mounted with lance in hand and helmet on head) and then resumed at sunrise of the day after, the French army supported also by Venetian troops managed to defeat the most celebrated Swiss pikemen, who until then were always victorious on the battlefield. When all was over, François Ier, who had fought throughout with gallant spirit and valour, requested the honour of knighthood from the noble Bayard. The city of Milan, abandoned by its Swiss protectors, easily fell under the French troops.

	#-#Leonardo de Vinci was an Italian painter draftsman sculptor architect and engineer whose genius perhaps more than that of any figure epitomized the Renaissance humanist ideal. His 'Last Supper' and 'Mona Lisa' are among the most widely popular and influential paintings of the Renaissance. His notebooks reveal a spirit of scientific inquiry and a mechanical inventiveness that were centuries ahead of their time. In October 1516, personally invited by the French King, Leonardo definitively left Italy for France, settling himself in Amboise under the protection of François Ier who also appointed him 'First King's painter, architect and engineer' and gave him the castle of Clos-Lucé, close and linked to the royal castle by means of a underground passage, and a yearly pension. Getting older and sick, Leonardo eventually died in his bed on 2 May 1519 at the supposed presence of a deeply grieved young French King.

	#-#In the same way as his father did for him, at the end of his life Emperor Maximilian made attempts to keep the imperial title amongst the members of the House of Habsburg. But his son Philip died unexpectedly early in 1506, leaving two male heirs, Charles and Ferdinand which were respectively born in 1500 and 1503. Maximilian decided to support Charles, who in 1516 was already Archduke of Burgundy, King of Spain, Sicily and Naples, in his investiture as King of the Romans and future Holy Roman Emperor. But this diplomatic move would have been very expensive. Most of the German princes were already supporting the French candidate, King François Ier. Maximilian seemed to successfully convoy the favour of the imperial electors towards the Habsburg cause, by means of granting investitures and making promises of large sums of money with the help of bankers such as the Fuggers and the Welsers. The Pope, who couldn't accept the presence of an Emperor with territorial claims in Italy as it was under the rule of Emperor Frederick II, would have supported a German prince like Friedrich III of Saxony, with no particular interest laying beyond the Alps. Looking for international credit, also Henry VIII King of England took part in the imperial election offering his candidature but withdrew soon after the first consultations.

	#-#On 28 June 1519 after the death of his grand-father, the Emperor Maximilian I of Habsburg, Charles, King of Spain and Duke of Burgundy, became Holy Roman Emperor thanks to the money of his bankers (Fuggers and Welsers mainly) in a very expensive struggle with François Ier King of France. Having proclaimed himself as the only legitimate heir of Charlemagne, the first Emperor of Frankish dynasty, François Ier had announced his candidature to the imperial election. As a matter of facts all the electors were heavily bribed in order to obtain the much desired vote, and that was standard practice at those times. Charles 'bought' the Imperial title paying the Great Electors and their emissaries the huge sum of 850,000 golden florins (equal to a value of Kg 2,100 of gold). That money came mainly from the Castilian rents as the New World still didn't provide with much income. Charles's election was also eased by the Army of the Svevian league, which impressed the doubtful electors when chasing the Duke of Wirtemberg, chief of the pro-French party, out of his duchy. That denied the last remote chance for François to win the election. Being elected Holy Roman Emperor as Charles V, Charles (Karl in the German world or Carlos in Spain) of the House of Habsburg obtained the rights of suzerainty over all the fiefs in the Holy Roman Empire. Amongst them the Duchy of Milan together with its sovereignty of the Republic of Genoa represented an important junction in the Habsburg's dominions, the socalled 'Spanish road'. As a result of this election, France found herself dangerously surrounded by the Habsburg might from the South with Spain, from the East with Northern Italy and Franche-Comté from the North with the Low Countries.

The Emperor believed that the peace with France had finally been achieved after François Ier, agreeing to renounce his claims in Italy, was freed and retaken to France, leaving his sons there as hostages and guarantees for the respect of the treaty. But within two months of his release and in spite of his sons taken as hostages in Spain, François Ier got the Parliament of Paris to void all the terms of the Treaty of Madrid because accepted under duress and in 1526 at Cognac he stipulated a holy league bringing into it Pope Clement VII together with Florence, Venice, Henry VIII of England and also the Duke of Milan, who even if previously restored to the throne by Charles V himself, voluntarily joined the alliance made to stop the Spanish hegemony over Italy.

	#-#Any league to stop Spanish hegemony didn't prove to be a solid alliance against Charles V troops (in fact, The Pope, taken captive by the lansquenets sacking Rome, abandoned the League of Cognac).. Genoa, important for military supply to the French troops fighting in Southern Italy, had turned to Spain thanks to the decisions of Andrea Doria who, dissatisfied by François Ier's misbehaviour to the Republic, preferred to offer his services to the Emperor. Since the military campaign in Italy was becoming too expensive for both sides and the political instability in the Empire due to religious conflicts was worsening, Louise of Savoy, François Ier's mother and regent of France, together with Margarete of Habsburg, Charles V's aunt and his representative in the administration of the Burgundian dominions, stipulated a peace treaty at Cambrai on 5 august 1529. The so called Ladies' Peace was successful, the signatories were the only ones who could have influence in the political decisions of the two monarchs and managed to induce them to make peace for the wealth of their respective countries. Signing that treaty, France had to renounce her claims to Milan, Asti, Flanders and Artois, while Spain gave up her inheritance rights to the Duchy of Bourgogne, a French fief. François Ier had also to withdraw all his troops from Italy and marry Eleanor, Charles's sister, in return for the liberation of his two sons, hostages at the Spanish court because of François Ier's disrespect for the treaty of Madrid. At Cambrai France abandoned her plans of expansionism in Italy while all her Italian allies joining an Anti-Spanish league would be now at the Emperor's mercy. The Republic of Florence would experience Charles V's rule.

The alliance that had been under discussion since 1525 was preliminarily agreed in February 1535 and formalized in February 1536 between French ambassador Laforest and Grand Vizier Ibrahim. The treaty also granted the French commercial concessions in the Ottoman Empire replacing Venice, as well as conceded the so called capitulations which also allowed French consuls legal jurisdiction over French subjects in Ottoman domains and recognized the French King as protector of the Christian holy places in Palestine, concessions that would have long-term effects on Ottoman relations with other foreign powers as well as internal development. The pact was kept secret, though, because to the Christians, the impious alliance between the Most Christian King and the worst enemy of Christendom was a heinous act.

	#-#At Francesco II Sforza's death, the Duchy of Milan reverted to the Empire and as Charles V newly rejected the French Orléans candidature to the Milanese throne, François Ier, King of France, planned a new military campaign in Italy against Charles V, this time with the help of the Turk. At first the French King attacked Savoy, because Duke Charles III refused French military access through his possessions, and annexed it with the assertion he had a dynastical claim to it. Deeply annoyed by this behaviour, Charles V sent an expeditionary force to conquer Provence, once imperial land. The expedition unfortunately failed while the scary Ottoman menace over Italy led Pope Paulus III to warmly invite the two contenders to make peace and form a Christian league in order to face the Turks. In 1538 in Nice a decennial truce was concluded with Papal support. But that cease-fire couldn't last too long. In 1542 Milan had to face a new French attack which resulted in an imperial heavy defeat at Ceresole in Piemonte, but although northern Italy totally fell under French control, at the same time English and Spanish-Imperial troops attacked France from both sides: even Paris was under menace. Lack of supplies and low troops reinforcements brought Charles V to eventually sign a peace treaty with François Ier at Crépy in late 1544. With that treaty France was recognized possession of Piemonte, still under French control and in spite of Savoyard legal claims to those lands, instead the Emperor was confirmed suzerainty over the duchy of Milan. That treaty also stated that François Ier had to renounce his claims to Naples, Flanders and Artois, while Charles V had to abandon any claim to the duchy of Bourgogne, ancestral Burgundian feud. It was also agreed that a diplomatic marriage had to be arranged between the youngest of François's sons, Charles Duke of Orléans and, either the Emperor's daughter (bringing Flanders and Franche-Comté as dowry) or the Emperor's niece and Ferdinand's daughter (bringing Milan as dowry). That would be by Emperor's choice. After two month's thoughts, Charles V decided to concede his daughter as spouse to Charles of Orléans, together with the dowry of Milan. However, in late 1545 the sudden death of Charles of Orléans liberated Charles V from the treaty's obligations and on 5 July 1546 he could invest his son Don Felipe with the Duchy of Milan. With this act, the imperial fief of Milan became definitively direct dominion of the Spanish line of the House of Habsburg.

He proceeded to renew the old alliance France had with 'the Turk', Sultan Süleyman I, whose fleet was so important to gain control of the accesses to the Italian peninsula in case of invasion from the sea. With the imperial Lutheran Princes he then stipulated the treaty of Chambord, under whose terms in exchange of financial and military help against the Habsburgs he was given a free hand in occupying the three neighbouring bishoprics of Metz, Toul and Verdun. In 1552-1557 King Henri II would also arrange further military expeditions to Italy, mainly to help the Republic of Siena lift the siege laid by the imperial troops in order to punish Siena's pro-French attitude, and to support Pope Paulus IV, with strong anti-Spanish attitude, in a league aiming at liberating Italy from the Spanish yoke in a last resolute attempt. In case of success the Pope would acknowledge French possession of Milan and Naples.

This decision was received with horror by the Sienese who begged with Charles V not to proceed. He refused, and several Sienese citizens in Rome received aid from French agents and collected an army. In 1552, as they marched on Siena the people revolted and threw out the Spanish troops, and an independent Siena took up a pro-French policy. Henri II, King of France, tried to exploit the situation by sending there an army led by Paul de Termes, who was successively substituted by Strozzi when an invasion of Corsica was attempted with the help of the Turkish fleet. On Emperor Charles V's decision to inflict an exemplary punishment upon the rebeling city, Cosimo I Duke of Tuscany responded to his call by invading and pillaging the villages surrounding Siena with the help of Spanish/imperial troops. After a year long siege laid by Medeghino and his Florentine troops, the city of Siena was eventually taken.

His old friend John Calvin was especially angered by these ideas. Servet also proposed that the blood traveled from the heart through the pulmonary artery and back through the pulmonary vein, without actually passing through the septum. Servetus' views on circulation, argued on theological grounds, were ignored until Harvey extended the theory.

The attempted coup, launched while the young King was at the royal hunting lodge of Amboise, was foiled: some of the conspirators were killed, and relations between these powerful families, already poisonous, took on the character of a blood-feud.

Violence errupted between Guise's men and Huguenots who were at worship there. While the casualties were heavy on both sides, for Huguenots throughout France the 'massacre' was proof of a Catholic conspiracy to destroy them, and within a month the prince of Conde and his Huguenot followers seized Orleans and began to arm themselves. Catherine hoped for a peaceful resolution and thus commanded the governor of Paris to order both Conde and Guise out of the city. Guise who had been hailed as a hero in Paris, knew his position was secure and stayed put. Conde rightfully fearing for his life, fled the city to meet up with Coligny. War was inevitable.

Though Coligny denied any involvement in the crime, and though a royal inquiry formally cleared him of the charge, the Guise family always believed in the Admiral's guilt and looked for revenge. In the long term, however, the assassination meant that the Guises could count on the support of all those Frenchmen for whom the murdered duke had been a national hero, the defender of Metz in 1552 and the conqueror of Calais in 1558, and the champion of the Catholic faith since. There is no doubt that the shots fired by Poltrot de Mere gravely exacerbated the civil divisions in France and added a new note of brutality to the conflict between Catholic and Huguenot.

Ambroise Paré gave his most significant contributions to amputation surgery and prosthetics sciences. He reintroduced the use of linen ligatures when he ran out of cautery oil during battle surgery. Time was still a limiting factor: a surgeon working with no anesthesia, tourniquet, or skilled aid hand was limited to about 30 seconds to amputate and 3 minutes to complete the operation. This is a very small amount of time for a surgeon to ligate major arteries and is why many, such as Guillemeau, Paré's student, again abandoned this method for direct cautery.

Pleased with the results of inquiry when they turned up negative, she decided to stay to her hunting and resting at an unprotected chateau. However as more and more rumbling of amassing troops and reports of confirmed sightings of soldiers came forth, she could no longer ignore the truth. The Court quickly retreated to the fortified town nearby Meaux. When word came of soldiers approaching Meaux, the Court, with the hired Swiss troops as escort, made a mad dash for Paris. France was once again at war.

	#-#The medieval Inquisition tried a large number of witches, but collective witch-hunting was exclusively a modern phenomena. Individual maleficium (Latin for witchcraft) was not uncommon in many rural areas, but it wasn't until scholastic demonology related witches and Sabbaths (night meetings with strong conspiracy elements, including cannibalism, orgies and a sacred oath of loyalty to Satan himself) that societies started to get obsessed with the matter. This conspiracy paranoia can track its roots as far as to the first massacres of Jews and Lepers in the High Middle Ages, when thousands were slaughtered by defeated Crusaders and angry countrymen. But it's in the early 15th century when demonological theories will become fully accepted by the upper classes. The Councils of Constance and Basel are considered to be the first public space in which these concepts, maleficium and Sabbath were publicly related. The work of Johannes Nider (1380-1438), The Formicarius (The Anthill), was a masterpiece of scholastic demonology and marked a new era in witch-hunting. The work of Heinrich Kramer (1430-1505), Malleus Maleficarum (Hammer of the Wicked) was the first work that reaches widespread attention, and works as a inquisitorial manual for witch-hunters. But it's not the Church that tries the most in Modern Ages. On the contrary, civil courts are responsible for 85-90 percent of executions. \n \nFrance is home to the very first conspiracy theories as early as the beginning of the 14th century. A powerful and centralized government was the only thing that stopped French towns from burning thousands of witches.

	#-#Jean Bodin (or Baudin or Bodinus) was a 16th Century French jurist, natural law philosopher and precursor of Mecantilism. He had a varied and insatiable intellectual curiosity, reading practically everything he could get his hands on. Bodin noticed that clipping, debasement and imports of silver had a common feature: they all increased the amount of money relative to goods. Consequently, Bodin put forth what is generally acknowledged as one of the first statements of the Quantity Theory of Money, detailing the relationship between price levels and the money supply, generally speaking. In 1576-7, Bodin served as a delegate of the Third Estate in the Estates-General of Blois. Bodin threw his political lot in with Michel d'Hôpital, whose politiques faction was trying to construct a ''third way'' between the extremists of the Catholic Holy League and the Calvinist Union. Bodin urged for negotiations with the Calvinists rather than resumption of the religious wars and he opposed the sale of the monarchy's lands to raise funds for any such endeavor. It was during the height of his active political involvement that Bodin composed his celebrated Six Books (1576), wherein he expounded his famous theory of sovereignty, which were in many ways consonant with the political positions he had expounded at the Estates-General.

Unable to solve the intractable problem of the Huguenots by force, the new King tried conciliation by issuing the Edict of Beaulieu, better known as the Peace of Monsieur because contemporaries assumed it had been forced on the King by the duke of Alencon (who, as the King's younger brother, was referred to as Monsieur). For the first time in the religious wars Huguenots were allowed free and public exercise of their religion, and eight fortified towns were placed under Huguenot control. However, the peace caused widespread indignation among Catholics, who viewed it as royal capitulation to the Huguenots. Some of them decided to oppose its implementation and to set up defensive leagues, similar in structure to the Huguenot 'state-within-a-state' in existence since the early 1560s. Instead of peace, Henri's policy led to more warfare, and in place of one grave threat to the French monarchy, created two.

The people of Paris, under the influence of the League preachers, were becoming dissatisfied with Henri III and his failure to suppress the Protestants. To be a moderate Catholic was almost as bad as being a heretic to the Leaguers and a popular uprising on the streets of Paris caused Henri III to flee the city. The Catholic League took complete control of the government, welcomed Guise to the city and pressed for a meeting of the Estates-General where they could propose the Cardinal de Bourbon as heir to the crown. There was even a fear that Henri III would be forced to abdicate and that the people might proclaim Guise King. On Christmas Eve in 1588, when Guise was at Blois for the meetings, Henri III invited him to his quarters for some discussion. When he entered, the doors were bolted and although he struggled heroically, he was killed. The same fate was visited on his brother, the Cardinal de Guise. But the younger brother, the Duc of Mayenne, remained alive and became the new leader of the League. Enraged by the treachery of the King, formerly moderate towns rushed to join the League.

The lords approached the Queen-mother, Marie de' Medici, confined in Blois. She was rescued from it by the Duke of Epernon on February 22, 1619. In 1620, Marie de' Medici led the revolt of the lords against the King, especially the dukes of Vendome (half-brothers of the King), the duke of Montmorency and the Duke of Rohan. The rebel forces met the royal armies led by Louis XIII himself at Ponts-de-Cé on August 7, 1620, where they were fully destroyed. With the advice of the bishop of Luçon (Richelieu) and from fear of seeing his mother continuing to plot, the King accepted his return to the court of France. Ten years later, Marie de' Médici will try once again to take the power back to Richelieu at the time of the Day of Dupes, but she will fail and be exiled.

Marillac fell in disgrace after the Day of Dupes but its code remained in application. The laws included in the code touched all the fields of the public life: policy, legal, economic and military. Among the most important applications of these laws, we can note the authorization granted to the nobles to practise the trade without strip of, which allowed, with the application of commercial taxes on the foreign merchants, to favour the French trade. In order to protect this trade, the code proposed the creation of a permanent war navy of dedicated to the protection of the sea trade ways. The taxation was also re-examined by a reform of the collection of the taxes and the reduced way of life of the court. In order to reduce the expenditure, several useless fortresses were destroyed. But on the other hand, the military expenditure was increased and a military regulation payment fixed the pays according to the rank and the conditions of quartering of the soldiers. The code allowed also the ennoblement of the commoners, which caused a social upheaval. Another aspect of the code was the reinforcement of the laws allowing the control of publishing books and printing works, allowing to the King a more thorough censorship. The code also prohibited constitution in association or league to the subjects of the King. This code set up the foundations for a strong and centralized state whose Louis XIV was going to push the expression to the maximum...

He particularly forbid the duels, favored the local middle-class or the recently established nobility of the merchants, and destroyed several fortresses owned by the Greats. In 1626, Louis XIII wished that his brother, Gaston, then heir of the Kingdom, marries one of the most beautiful matches of France, Marie de Bourbon, princess of Montpensier. The purpose of this marriage was to control the order of succession as Louis didn't have a direct heir. This marriage had been thought of by Richelieu. Thus, various interests of the nobles and all the hatreds against Richelieu gathered around Gaston, so a party 'of the aversion to the marriage' was born. The duchess of Chevreuse, the Queen, Marie de' Médici and the half-brothers of the King, the princes de Vendôme, pressed Gaston to leave the court and rebel against the King. The lover of the duchess of Chevreuse, the count de Chalais was supposed to assassinate Richelieu by claiming a quarrel. Because of internal dissensions, the plot was quickly discovered. The King and Richelieu immediately reacted and arrested the conspirators. The princes de Vendôme were imprisoned, the duchess of Chevreuse exiled in Lorraine, and Gaston had to yield to the will of the King and marry Marie de Bourbon nevertheless, gaining the duchy of Orleans. Only the count de Chalais was executed by decapitation, because he was the only participant not to belong to the royal family or to its entourage. Although not very serious, this conspiracy showed the increasing opposition of the nobles to the policy of Richelieu.

Jealous of the many signs of respect and preference showed by the King to Richelieu, Gaston of Orleans deserted the court and took refuge in Lorraine then after in the Netherlands where he published a proclamation against the cardinal on May 30, 1631. Several nobles, upset to see Richelieu cut down gradually their privileges, supported Gaston. Among them was the duke of Lorraine and the duke of Montmorency, whose cousin had been executed on order of Richelieu and the King for having gone against the law on the duels three years before. The duke of Montmorency, then governor of Languedoc, stirred up the province against the King and Richelieu with the help of Gaston of Orleans. The troops of Montmorency were defeated in Castelnaudary on September 1, 1632 by the marshal of Schomberg. Montmorency was captured, sentenced to death and decapitated on the orders of Richelieu in Toulouse on October 30, 1632. Gaston of Orléans managed to flee in the Netherlands where he remained until 1634, date on which his brother forgave him.

But in 1635 the Emperor and the German princes stipulated a peace treaty in Prague, with which the Protestant rulers were allowed to retain secularized bishoprics held by them in 1627, the enforcement of the Edict of Restitution was delayed for 40 years, the armies of the Emperor and of the German states were reunited to one imperial army and the German princes were forbidden to have alliances between them or with foreign powers. Since this treaty acknowledged the authority of the Habsburg party in the Empire and subsequently it renewed the threat for France of being surrounded at her borders, Cardinal Richelieu decided it was the moment for France to enter a preventive war against Spain and Austria. The religious character of the early war lost any real significance, from now on a struggle for the hegemony in Europe would take place.

The duke of Bouillon and the count de Soissons raised troops and accepted the support of Spain, then invaded France. The plan of the conspirators envisaged to assassinate the cardinal and to incite the rebellion among the people of Paris. As soon as the Spanish army joined the forces of the conspirators, they engaged the troops of the King in battle near the Marfée. They gained a complete victory, crushing the royal army, but the death of the count of Soissons, killed in the battle by a shot in the head, made the victory useless to the ones who were dissatisfied. We don't truly know how the count of Soissons died, if he was killed by a sniper or if, more probably, he died of his own blunder, having the bad habits to raise his visor with the barrel of his gun. The duke of Bouillon submitted himself soon after to the King and kept the town of Sedan. He took part, a few months later, to another conspiracy and lost, definitively this time, the town of Sedan.

His influence on the King was great, almost as much as Richelieu's. He hoped to reinforce his position at the court by marrying the richest heiress of the time, Marie of Gonzague, but her being adverse an opponent of Richelieu, the cardinal vetoed such an alliance. The marquis of Cinq-Mars was extremely heinous against Richelieu. He was then approached by several important nobles who couldn't bear any more Richelieu gradually depriving them of their rights and privileges. Thus a conspiracy was born with purpose of getting of Richelieu and joined together the duke of Orleans (the brother of the King), the Queen, Anne Austria, the marquis of Frontailles and the duke of Bouillon. They requested the help of Spain in war with France since 1635 and signed a treaty where Philippe IV provided the conspirators with 120.00 infantrymen, 6.000 cavalry and 400.000 ecus in exchange for a peace treaty where each one returned the conquered cities and where France gave its Swedish and German alliances up. The conspirators even envisaged to assassinate Richelieu. Nobody knows with certainty who betrayed the conspirators, but it was probably the Queen, Anne of Austria, who sought to protect her son, the future Louis XIV. On 12 June, informed of this plot, Richelieu warned the King who gave the order to arrest the traitors. Cinq-Mars was arrested as well as the brother of the King, the marquis of Frontailles fled abroad while the duke of Bouillon, trying to escape, was found in a barn full of hay. The duke of Bouilon and Gaston, the brother of the King, managed in clearing themselves but not Cinq-Mars who ended up on the scaffold on September 12, 1642. Richelieu had once again succeeded in overcoming his opponents but had alienated the remainder of the nobility even more.

It was followed by that of the upper nobility (Fronde des Princes), but the rebellion was finally suppressed by a combination of Machiavellian diplomacy, betrayals and reverses of fortune. The Parliament was muzzled (it would not be convened again before 1789) and the upper nobility deprived of political power, preparing the advent of total royal absolutism under the Sun King, Louis XIV, after 1661.

In the evening, the Duke's palace was assaulted and the ambassadress's carriage was even shot at. Six men died, including a civilian who happened to belong to the Duke's household. Louis XIV reacted immediately by sending back the Nuncio from Paris, invaded the Comtat- Venaissin and asked for the Corsican Guard to be entirely disbanded and for the Corsicans to be declared unfit to serve the Papal States. Before that, fifty of its members would have to be hanged and three-hundred and fifty others sent to the galleys.\nThis was of course only a mean to assert his power, still new and frail, on the international stage.

The Company failed to found a successful colony on Madagascar, but was able to establish ports on the nearby islands of Bourbon and Île-de-France (today's Réunion and Mauritius). In 1673 it had established itself at Pondicherry, first step of the french presence in India.

It is unfortunate that continental and English mathematicians remained embroiled for decades in a heated and pointless priority dispute over the discovery of calculus. Leibniz made many contributions to the study of differential equations, and the procedure for solving first order linear equations. During most of his youth years Leibniz lived in Paris, and even took part in french diplomatic missions. Leibniz would have liked to have remained in Paris in the just created Academy of Sciences, but it was considered that there were already enough foreigners.

As a result of distinguished service in the War of the Spanish Succession, he became a French subject and was appointed a Marshal of France after his successful expedition against Nice in 1706. On 25 April 1707, Berwick won the great and decisive victory of Almanza, where an Englishman at the head of a Franco-Spanish army defeated Ruvigny, a Frenchman at the head of an Anglo-Portuguese-Dutch army. After Almanza, Berwick was created Duc de Fitz-James in the Peerage of France by Louis XIV, and Duque de Liria y Xérica and Lieutenant of Aragon by Philip V of Spain. The last great event of the War of the Spanish Succession was the storming of Barcelona by Berwick, after a long siege, on 11 September 1714.

Jakub Sobieski was in Silesia at the time and was unlucky enough to be arrested by Saxon troops. On 37th June 1697 the Szlachta assembled on the election field voted overwhelmingly for the Prince de Conti and the Primate proclaimed him King. On the same evening a small group of malcontents 'elected' Friedrich Augustus, who marched into Poland at the head of a Saxon army. On September 15th, as the Prince de Conti, escorted by a French squadron under Jean Bart, was sailing through the Sound, Friedrich Augustus was crowned in Kraków by the Bishop of Kujavia as Augustus II of Poland. At the end of the month the Prince of Conti came ashore only to discover that he had been pipped at the post. His supporters were far more numerous than Augustus and they immediately to certain precautions showing off strength and surrounding the now unsupplied Saxon army. Augustus inauguration did not become what he had hoped for. He had hoped for the Crown of Poland, but what he got was a truce and a chance to sneak back to Saxony again. Francois Louis was master in Poland and could be crowned on New Years Day 1698.

	#-#The political sickness of the Polish body manifested itself fully after the death of Jan III Sobieski in 1696. The election that followed was one of the most dismal episodes in Polish parliamentary history. The primary candidates were the King's son Jakub Sobieski, Francois Louis de Bourbon, Prince de Conti, and Friedrich Augustus Wettin, Elector of Saxony. Jakub Sobieski was in Silesia at the time and was unlucky enough to be arrested by Saxon troops. On 37th June 1697 the Szlachta assembled on the election field voted overwhelmingly for the Prince de Conti and the Primate proclaimed him King. On the same evening a small group of malcontents 'elected' Friedrich Augustus, who marched into Poland at the head of a Saxon army. On September 15th, as the Prince de Conti, escorted by a French squadron under Jean Bart, was sailing through the Sound, Friedrich Augustus was crowned in Kraków by the Bishop of Kujavia as Augustus II of Poland. At the end of the month the Prince of Conti came ashore only to discover that he had been pipped at the post. His supporters were far more numerous than Augustus and they immediately to certain precautions showing off strength and surrounding the now unsupplied Saxon army. Augustus inauguration did not become what he had hoped for. He had hoped for the Crown of Poland, but what he got was a truce and a chance to sneak back to Saxony again. Francois Louis was master in Poland and could be crowned on New Years Day 1698.

The new natural sciences had revealed that nature was subject to reason, so the Enlightenment philosophers saw it as their duty to lay a foundation for morals, religion, and ethics in accordance with man's immutable reason. Three central figures contributing to such ideas were Montesquieu (1689-1755), Voltaire (1694-1778) and Rousseau (1712-1778). They were partly inspired by more liberal ideas imported from Britain, and also by John Locke. They became increasingly opposed to the power of the clergy, the King, and the nobility. During the eighteenth century these institutions had far more power in France than they had in England. The Enlightenment thinkers believed it was essential to remain sceptical of all inherited truths, on the grounds that the individual must find his own answer to every question.

Only the war in Spain seemed favorable to the Bourbons, but Louis XIV was ready to abandon his grandson in exchange for peace. But the allies were frustrated by their inability to impose the Archduke on the Spaniards, and surprised by their stern resistance, and went too far in their conditions demanding that Louis should remove his own grandson from the throne of Spain by force. This was a humiliation too big to endure, and Louis understood that he was negotiating from a position of weakness and decided to break the negotiations and renew the fight. Time would prove him right, as dissensions were already dividing the allies as the French threat receded. The Dutch and the Austrians were already at odds over the Spanish Netherlands, and the Austrians were seeing as not doing their part, occupied with the Hungarian revolt. The turning point was the unexpected death of Emperor Joseph I, at 33 years of age in April 1711. While Charles left Spain and went to Vienna to be elected emperor, the allies were not ready to reconstruct the empire of Charles V, and England immediately started peace negotiations with France without informing the Dutch or Austria.

Since Spain and Austria had not settled the issue and it was impossible to reach an agreement between all participants, it was decided that separate peace treaties between the parties would end the war. This decision, arranged between France and England, was favourable to France, who avoided the worst consequences of a lost war. By the treaty with England on April 11, 1713, Louis recognized the Hanover rule in England and confirmed the renunciation of Felipe's claims to the French throne. Hudson Bay territory, Acadia, St. Kitts and Newfoundland were ceded, and the demolition the fortress of Dunkirk agreed. The same day France agreed that the United Provinces should annex part of Guelders, and will keep the Spanish Netherlands in deposit for Charles VI Habsburg. He also recognized the King of Prussia, and acknowledged the right of the Duke of Savoy to the Kingdom of Sicily and to Nice. To Portugal, a small part of the Guiana was ceded. The peace with Charles VI will have to wait to the treaties of Rastatt (March 6, 1714) and Baden (September 7, 1714), acknowledging his right to the Spanish Netherlands, Milan, Naples and Sardinia, and restoring the left bank of the Rhine to the Empire. In Utrecht, France lost the hegemony of Europe, which passed to a system of equilibriums arbitrated by England.

The Sejm finally agreed on Stanislas, but this was rejected by Austria and Russia starting the war of Polish Succession. The war ended with August III on the Polish throne. We do not know whom has control of the Kingship, but we must act quickly.

	#-#Maurice, comte de Saxe (Moritz von Sachsen, 1696-1750) was a general and military theorist who successfully led French armies during the War of the Austrian Succession (1740-48). Anna Ivanovna, duchess of Courland (later empress of Russia), secured Saxe's election as duke of Courland (a Baltic duchy between Prussia and Latvia) in 1726, but the Russians expelled him from the region in 1727 in order to prevent him from marrying the duchess. Returning to France, Saxe in 1732 wrote Mes Rêveries (published in 1756-57), a remarkably original treatise on the science of warfare. He served with distinction in the French army against his own half brother, King August III of Poland, in the War of the Polish Succession (1733-38) and in 1734 was made a lieutenant general. In November 1741, six months after France joined Prussia against Austria in the War of the Austrian Succession, Saxe invaded Bohemia and captured Prague. Although the British had not yet become involved in the conflict, the French King Louis XV in January 1744 made Saxe commander of a force that was to invade Great Britain on behalf of Charles Edward, the Young Pretender, the Stuart claimant to the British throne. The project was dropped after a storm shattered Saxe's invasion fleet at Dunkirk in March. Shortly thereafter, Louis formally declared war on Great Britain and promoted Saxe to the rank of marshal. Saxe and the King then invaded the Austrian Netherlands. The King wisely allowed Saxe to give the orders in the ensuing campaign. Their forces surrounded Tournai, and, when allied troops advanced from the east to relieve the siege, Saxe decisively defeated them in the Battle of Fontenoy (May 11, 1745). It was France's last great victory before the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789. Saxe then captured Brussels and Antwerp (February 1746). Turning south, he seized Mons and Namur, and on Oct. 11, 1746, he defeated the allies at Raucoux, near Liège, thereby completing the conquest of the Austrian Netherlands. In January 1747 Louis appointed Saxe marshal general of France. In 1747 he invaded Holland, defeated an allied army in the Battle of Lauffeld near Maastricht (July 2), and captured the fortress of Bergen-Op-Zoom. Saxe retired to his château at Chambord, where he died. His grandson was the father of the novelist George Sand.

The Count de Boissieux landed in San Fiurenzu on 6th February 1738 with 3000 men. At this time, there was already a strong party among the Corsican rebel leaders who were willing to bring Corsica under French domination, so they were quite disapointed when after a few parleys it became clear that the French troops were only acting on behalf of the Republic. De Boissieux too had learned something from these first meetings: that the Corsican rebels may give themselves to whichever power who would allow them to escape from Genoa, possibly an enemy of France. As for now, the rebels were gaining time, not daring to fight the French contingent until they were left choiceless. At the end of the year, new statutes were published, based upon the ones granted in 1733 with very few ameliorations, and of course arms would have to be surrendered. When the French troops began to move towards the interior to seize arms, the rebels were indeed left choiceless. On 13th December, the French were defeated by a large Corsican army at U Borgu and retreated towards Bastia. Reinforcements had to be sent and in the Spring of 1739 there were nearly 10000 French soldiers under the Marquis de Maillebois in Corsica. Against such a strong force, the rebels were soon militarily defeated. Corti fell at the end of June and on 10th July, Luiggi Giafferi, Ghjacintu Paoli and his young son Pasquale, Ghjuvan Ghjacumu Ambrosi and 26 other important leaders negotiated their exile from the island and took sail for Naples. The last fightings took place in the Dilà dei Monti until the end of October.

So, Louis XV decided to undertake vast reforms in the arsenals. He passed an ordinance on September 28 1748 that abolished the sentence, although not definitively. This ordinance attached by the same occasion the body of the galleys to the Royal Navy. So harsh were the living conditions and corporal punishments on board, that a sentence to serve on the galleys was like a death sentence. Moreover, as the wars of Louis XV came to an end, the Navy required fewer crews: now, prisonners convicted to forced labour were sent in majority to the convict prison and were employed as a cheap workforce by the Admiralty. Following this ordinance, the convict prisons of Toulon and Brest borned since 1748, then, Rochefort in 1776. The galleys were progressively replaced by the frigates, which were quite superior.

In 1749, he projected to create a new tax, the 'vingtième' (which means the twentieth), which would taxed the net incomes of all the subjects of the King, including on those of the privileged people. For the latter, the outcry was general. The Parlements, the provincial States, the Parlement of the clergy protested, organized even some true riots. But if the Parlement of Paris capitulated, the high clergy made face with pugnacity. Initially, Louis XV supported his minister with firmness. But then, by a reversal of which he was accustomed, the King abandonned his minister. This backing of Louis XV front of the revolt of privileged made him extremely unpopular in the people. At the same time, it had as a by-effect the increasing boldness of the Parlements. They criticized bitterly the monarchical absolutism and they demanded a right of control on the government. Louis XV had just taken a bad way whose consequences would be dramatic for the finances and the stability of the Kingdom.

The French kept promising that they would leave but feeling that most of the population was friendly towards them and dreaded the return of the Genoese, they showed no sign of moving. The first incidents between French and pro-Genoese Corsicans happened near Sarté in November 1751. The next year, more serious fights opposed French and Genoese soldiers first in Bastia and then in other places as the newly appointed Genoese Comissar Giovanni Grimaldi was touring the island.

Its title, typical of the time, sounds more like a table of contents: 'Cyclopaedia: or a Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences, Containing an Explication of the Terms ... in the Several Arts, both Liberal and Mechanical ... etc., etc. ... '.\n The new idea here is mechanical arts. Earlier encylopedias were never that down-to-earth. The French arranged to publish Chambers's encyclopedia in 1745.\n But, after a fight with the English translator, they decided to develop a greatly expanded French version instead. By 1747, Denis Diderot had assumed leadership of the project -- except for mathematical parts, which were handled by the mathematician d'Alembert.\n Diderot added real fire to the project. He was briefly jailed in 1749 for his liberal views, and when the first two volumes were published in 1751, he was attacked by Jesuit authorities.\n The problem was that Diderot and the other writers were rationalists. The work was now titled Encyclopedia, or a Systematic Dictionary of Science, Arts, and the Trades, and it was on its way to becoming a 28-volume treatise on human affairs.\n The Dictionnaire, as it was called, laid bare the workings of the known world in a way no one had ever tried to do. It boldly told the average man that he could know what only Kings, emperors, and their lieutenants were supposed to know.\n It suggested that anyone should have access to rational truth. In that sense it was a profoundly revolutionary document.

The peace that followed the conflict, provoked by the foreign opposition to the Pragmatic Sanction stated by the former Emperor Charles VI and ended with the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, resulted in a well defined rivalry between major European powers forming essentially two main political formations: the alliance of the socalled 'Bourbon family pact' (France, Spain, Naples and the latest Parma, all with members of the same House of Bourbons) with Prussia and the alliance between Austria, Russia and England. Disappointed by England's interested approaches to the emerging power of Prussia wich led to the Convention of Westminster, a treaty with which both countries would avoid any foreign military presence or access in the German territories, Austria strengthened her political ties with Saxony, Russia and Sweden and started new diplomatic handlings with France, traditionally an arch-enemy of the Habsburgs since the old dispute over the Burgundian inheritance but for sure the most powerful antagonist to the rising British colonial empire. And an alliance with France would also mean the support of Spain and the Bourbon Italian monarchies. That diplomatic move would lead to a huge world conflict fought in the years between 1756 and 1763: the socalled 'Seven Years War'.

	#-#From the 1750s, the Parlements begun to practise a policy of systematic obstruction against all royal measurements, while Louis XV, fearful, did not find the energy to manage the reforms which were essential. However, in December 1756, the King decided to put an end to the rebellion of the magistrates and succeeded in making record by the Parlements the edicts restricting a part of their capacities but this united the people against him. In January 1757, during the Seven Year War, Robert-François Damiens tried to murder the King in the gardens of Versailles with a knife but Louis XV was only slightly wounded at the shoulder. Slightly disturbed, Damiens wanted to force Louis XV to reconcile with his people. The entourage of the King and especially Mrs. de Pompadour, made pressure on the Parlement in order that his gesture was interpreted like a regicide. In spite of the anger of the people which protested against this judgement, Damiens would be condemned to the one of the most dreadful torments of all the History. He was initially attached during 57 days on a rack mattress. Then he was condemned to the fire torment. Arms and legs were burnt by red-hot pincers and lead melted was put on the wounds. Then, he undergone quartering during more than two hours, but being very robust, the members did not give way and the exhausted horses should be changed. To put an end to the torture, the executioner approached and quickly cut the tendons, which made fall the four members. All that remained of Damiens when it was thrown to the woodshed was only one trunk whose chest breathed and whose lips still moved... The torment of Damiens, of an age not being one of the Enlightment, did nothing but reinforce the parliamentary protests, which did not fail to underline the disproportionate characteristic of this sentence. Louis XV, the 'Beloved', was not it any more and had definitively lost the favours of his people.

All the accounts of the eyewitnesses of the attacks described an animal looking like a wolf. But the wounds, extremely unusual, such as the size of the bites as well as decapitations, couldn't be made by a wolf but only by a 'beast'. In front of the extent of the massacre and the inefficiency of the local lords, the peasants called upon Louis XV. He, touched by their misfortunes, sent a regiment of dragoons commanded by the captain Duhamel to solve the problem. Despite several beats and the massacre of hundreds of wolves, the attacks didn't stop. Louis XV even had to send his personal gun carrier, François Antoine de Beauterne, who does not succeed in doing better than Duhamel. This story had unpleasant consequences on the reign of Louis XV. Not only the peasants always remained under the threat of the 'beast', but became exhausted by the many hunts without being able to plough their fields. Moreover, by the failure of Duhamel and Beauterne, Louis XV became the laughing stock of the other monarchs, especially in England, and the secretly published newspapers tackled its authority severely. The affair fascinated all the French and became one fo the main subject of conversation during two years.

The local population was defended by itself and the majority of the men only moved armed. After a last victim on June 17, 1767, a poacher named Jean Chastel succeeds on June 19 in killing an extraordinary wolf by his size and his proportions, very different from the common wolves. Some described the killed 'beast' as a large mastiff with long bristling furs and a broad breast. After that, no more attack nor murder was recorded in the area. The affair stopped but remained unsolved since nothing proved that the Chastel's wolf was the 'beast'. Nowadays, it remains some shades on this story, especially such as certain female victims discovered were stripped, the heads of some bodies were carried by the 'beast' (what no animal does) and the 'beast' didn't attack adult men. Several hypothesis were evoked since the 18th century to explain it: giant wolf, tiger, hyena, fantastic animal like a bear crossbred with a monkey, werewolf or even, a serial-killer. The selected hypothesis today is that it was probably a cross between a wolf and a Neapolitan mastiff and this 'beast' was trained to attack by someone who could be Jean Chastel himself. But nothing is truly proven...

In 1761, the Parlement had finally the possibility of making pressure on Louis XV to banish the Society of Jesus from France. The occasion was given by the trial of the father La Valette. This Jesuit had made bad business in the Antilla. Its creditors bring an action against the Society which was condemned to refund them. Taking advantages of the trial, the Parlement of Paris examined the constitution of the Society, declared it in opposition to the laws of the Kingdom and concluded that the Company was to be dissolved in France. The Jesuits could remain in the Kingdom only by way of simple priests, directly submitted to the bishops. After two years of resistance, the King agreed. The Society of Jesus was abolished in France in November 1764. The other sovereigns of the Bourbon dynasty, from Spain, Parma, and Two-Sicilies followed this example and those from Portugal which had preceded it. Then, all of them agreed with Louis XV to demand to the Pope the abolition of the Society in the entire catholic world in 1773. The Society of Jesus was reconstituted only at the beginning of the XIXth century. The victory of the Parlement over the Jesuits was accompanied by a recrudescence of the fanaticism from the magistrates who were opposed to the Enlightenment while fighting against the Protestants. Many examples of intolerance followed: the hanging of the pastor Rochette who had preached in spite of the law, the torment of the Protestant Jean Calas accused to have killed his son to prevent it from converting to Catholicism or the execution of the young knight de la Barre for practices sacrileges...

He would be replaced by a triumvirate made up of the duke d'Aiguillon to the Foreign Affairs, of the abbot Terray to the Finances and René Nicolas de Maupeou with justice. The King was at this time in conflict, once more, with the Parlements of Rennes which was opposing to the duke d'Aiguillon and with the Parlement of Paris which made public reproach with the King of its support to the duke. The crisis with the members of Parlement was accentuated when in January 1771, the Parlement of Paris refused to be in session in order to ratify the royal decisions. Maupeou then convinced the King to act. January 20, Louis XV sent his musketeers to the residence of the recalcitrant and exiled them to the province, without taking account of the protests of the public opinion, the middle-class and even of the princes of blood (his own family), by ignoring absolutely the pamphlets from Beaumarchais. Decided to give back to the royalty its power, Maupeou formed a new Parlement with more flexible magistrates and removed the venality of the offices and introduced the equality of all the subjects in front of the justice. But these late measurements did nothing but worsen the unpopularity of the growing old King...

Nonetheless, the Comte de Marbeuf, French military governor in the island, was cautious enough to not provoke any large-scale revolt. It was during one of his absence in May 1774 that the situation went awry. The Comte de Narbonne, second in command to Marbeuf, who had been urging him for years to increase the degree of violence against the 'bandits' and their families and villages, suddendly found himself in a position to do it by himself, especially when the returned exiles gave him an opportunity by launching a round of small localized revolts against French troops, in the hope to rally the population to an eventual return of Paoli. The Paolists thought it wise to act during Marbeuf's absence, it turned out it wasn't. Narbonne reacted most violently. Entire villages were burnt down and known rebels' families chased from their homes, while captured 'rebels' were hanged without any form of trial. By the end of the year, there were no more rebels.

The reaction of the citizenship of Paris was to storm the Tuileries (the new King's royal court since the people of Paris struck by famine stormed Versailles in October 1789) to have the King confirm former government. But the final struck to the monarchy was given by the proclamation of the Duke of Brunswick, a Prussian army leader opposed to a revolutionary France, who threatened to destroy the city of Paris in case anyone would attempt on the King's life again. As result of this the people of Paris had the city council deposed and established 'La Commune insurrectionnelle de Paris' with extreme radical republican attitudes and stormed the Tuileries for a second time as to have the King house-arrested and definitively suspended from his powers. Under those popular pressures the legislative assembly was forced to call for another election to form a new assembly, the National Convention, which would have worked at the draft of a new and more democratic and egalitarian constitution.

On 2 June 1793 an insurrection broke out in Paris obliging the national convention to decree the arrest of all the Girondins. As answer to this a big federalist insurrection led by the remnants of the Gironde party was organized in several provinces of France but it resulted in a complete failure as in a few months it was easily tamed. Since the coup d'état of 2 June, the Montagnard party led by Robespierre no longer faced any strong political opposition to the way they would lead their own radical republican but firmly intransigent domestic policy. Maximilien Robespierre emerged as the leading figure on the Committee of Public Safety. Robespierre was the son and grandson of lawyers from the northern town of Arras. Historians differ in their interpretation of Robespierre. These range from the view that he was a popular democrat who saved the essence of the revolution to one presenting him as the precursor of twentieth-century totalitarianism. In any event, Robespierre crushed the counter-revolution and masterminded the Terror, a period of time during which 'Madame Guillotine' was held warm by the blood of the people.

The first unit chosen was based on a pendulum beating a second. On March 30, 1791, after a proposal by the Académie des Sciences, the Assembly finally chose that a metre would be a 1/10 000 000 of the distance between the north pole and the equator. On April 7, 1795 (18 Germinal year III) the Convention decreed that the new 'Republican Measures' were to be henceforth legal measures in France. The motto 'for all nations in all times' was adopted for the new system. This was the Decimal Metric System, which proved to be simple to use, and making measure transitions between different dimensions easier beyond compare. The metric system has survived practically unchanged as the basis of today's International System of Units.

	#-#Since March 1793 those spontaneous and uncoordinated riots of peasants in Vendée, also supported by local nobles and refractory priests, organized themselves in a 'Royal and Catholic Army' against which the inadequately equipped Republican forces were being easily routed. The Convention took measures against the emigrés and the refractory priests and on 19 March 1793 it was decreed that every person accused of taking part in the counter-revolutionary revolts, or of wearing the white cockade was to be declared as an outlaw and commissions were sent to where the municipalities needed to be purged. But these measures proved to be insufficient as the successes of the Vendeans, coordinated with the Chouans, still continued in the 'bocages', whose knowledge gave the local rebels immense advantage. The defeats sustained by the Vandéans at Cholet and Savenay put definitely at end the regular warfare but not the massacres upon the civilians which were perpetrated by the republican forces in the rebelling departments. From January to July 1794 'Infernal columns' were formed and sent into Vendée under the command of Tourreau with the Directory's formal order to 'exterminate this rebellious race of Vendéans, to make their abodes disappear, to torch their forests, to cut their crops'. Things went better after the changes of 9 Thermidor when the Convention allowed liberty of worship to the Vendeans and limitations to their conscriptions. In July 1795 a new 'emigrés' expedition was attempted in the landing at Quiberon with the support of Chouans and of some remnants of Vendéan troops, however it ended in complete failure with the death of the last two 'White' chiefs. Only after July 1796 the 'troubles in the West were definitively appeased' and the state of siege was eventually lifted. It was esteemed that in 1793-1796 at least about 120,000 out of a population of around 815,000 died in the 'genocide' of the Vendéens.

These two were successively merged into the Cisalpine Republic on 29 June 1797 with the capital in Milan. The Cisalpine Republic consisted of roughly the former Duchy of Milan, those portions of the Republic of Venice west of the Adige River, the Duchy of Modena, the Papal Legations, the Piedmontese province of Novara, west of Ticino River and the Valtellina. But The Republic would have dissolved after the defeats of France against the Second Coalition in 1799 occupied by Austro-Russian forces. Only in 1800 in the second Italian campaign after the Battle of Marengo First Consul Napoléon Bonaparte retook the territories which this time were extended to the former Austrian lands of the Veneto and the Papal Legations. In January 1802, the Cisalpine Republic changed its name to Italian Republic with Napoléon Bonaparte as its president.

Successfully dodging the British fleet constantly patrolling the Mediterranean in search of French presence, he managed to make return to France where the coup d'état of the 18 Brumaire would then have occurred. Letting alone and without command and precise orders, the French troops found themselves at the mercy of the British troops better fitted and supplied.

	#-#After the signing of the second treaty of San Ildefonso, France started to pressure Spain to collaborate in an invasion of Portugal to dislodge her from her alliance with England. Carlos IV was the father-in-law of Joao VI, prince of Brazil and regent of Portugal, and did not desire a conflict, but French pressure was too strong. Joao could not accept Napoléon's demands of ceding a quarter of his territory to Spain as a guarantee, and so the war became inevitable. On May 20, 1801, Godoy invaded Portugal from three points, and in nine days completely defeated the Portuguese army, before the French army sent to participate in the campaign could cross Spain. Godoy sent a branch of an orange tree from the moat of Elvas to his Queen and lover, and hence the name of the war. But Carlos IV had no intention of leaving Portugal in the hands of Napoléon, and against his instructions, signed the treaty of Badajoz with Joao. It was a very favorable treaty for Portugal, who had to pay indemnities to France, close her ports to British ships, cede a small part of the Guiana to France, and the small town of Olivenza to Spain. The treaty was signed on the 8th of June, but dated on the 6th, so Carlos could ignore Napoléon's instructions received on the 7th. Napoléon was furious and did not ratify the treaty until the 29th of September.

On the night of June 17th, 1798, the Grand Master left his palace and the island, taking with him but a few religious artifacts. The French however did not have a chance to settle down on Malta. Their reckless pillaging resulted in a full-scale uprising in a matter of months. The Maltese, supported by Portuguese and English forces, retook the island. On the 15th of June, 1802, a group of Maltese nobles, led by Marquis Testaferrata, offered the island to the British crown. Soon it proved to be invaluable, serving as a perfect operating base for the English fleet after the declaration of Napoléon's continental blockade.

	#-#Jean-Baptiste Say was inspired to write his Treatise on Political Economy when, working at a life insurance office, he read a copy of Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations. His Treatise, often described as a popularization of Smith's ideas, departed from the typical economics methodology of his day. This departure was based on Say's conviction that the study of economics should start not with abstract mathematical and statistical analyses but with the real experience of the human person. Such a humanistic stress resulted in Say's emphasis on the role of the entrepreneur in an economy. In fact, this emphasis was Say's primary contribution to the field of economics. While popular abroad, Say's Treatise brought put him into conflict with Napoléon, who was furious at Say's refusal to tone down his criticism of France's disastrous fiscal policies. This run in with the French dictator soon forced Say to put his theory into practice. He was removed from the French government, and his book was suppressed. Undaunted, Say used the latest English technology to establish a cotton spinning plant, which became quite profitable for the ten years he owned it. Meanwhile, Say and his Treatise came to the attention of Thomas Jefferson and James Madison. Madison thought it the best book ever written about economics. Jefferson courted Say to be a professor of political economy at the new University of Virginia. It was not until 1814, with Napoléon exiled, that Say's Treatise came back into print in France. Say himself was finally appointed to a professorship in economics, first at the Athénée, then at the Conservatoire des Arts et Metiers, and finally at the College de France, where he occupied France's first chair in political economy.

Having annexed Tuscany, Piedmont, Genoa, and the Rhineland directly into France, Napoléon placed the Kingdom of Holland (which until 1806 was the Batavian Commonwealth) under his brother Louis, the Kingdom of Westphalia under his brother Jérôme, the Kingdom of Italy under his stepson Eugène as his viceroy, the Kingdom of Spain under his brother Joseph, and the Grand Duchy of Warsaw (carved out of Prussian Poland) under the nominal sovereignty of his ally the King of Saxony.

On 26 May 1805 in a ceremony arranged in Milan's Dome Napoléon crowned himself King of Italy and said the ritual words: 'God gave it to me, woe to him who touches it'. These were the words spoken for the first time by Charlemagne when he received the crown as King of the Lombards in 774.

This kingdom would comprise of the Duchy of Warsaw an possibly include territories further east, acquired by Russia in the Polish Partitions 1772-1795.\n However, the British side had objections, and a compromise was found according to which the province of Posen became Prussian, and the rest of the Duchy of Poland (Congress Poland) was reestablished as a Kingdom, in dynastic union with Russia. Cracow was declared a free city under the joint protection of its three neighbours, Austria, Prussia and Russia.

He was succeeded by his five year old son Napoléon Louis Bonaparte. Napoléon Louis reigned as Louis II for just ten days. Napoléon ignored his young nephew's accession to the throne, abolished the Kingdom of Holland and incorporated the region under direct rule within the French Empire.

When it became known that he was still in possession of the diamonds left to him by Joachim Murat before his departure for Naples, and that he was 'keeping himself', according to the Corsican saying, in his small village at Sari di Porti Vechju, the Marquis de Rivière, Extraordinary Commissar of Louis XVIII in Corsica, attempted to capture him. First by treason, which failed, then by force which failed too faced with the arising of the whole region known as the Fium'orbu. On 18 April 1816, a 8000 strong French army was defeated and Rivière was nearly captured. Shortly after this humiliating defeat, Rivière was removed from office and his successor negotiated Poli's exile for Austria, with the diamonds.
