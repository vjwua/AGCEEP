Nanak died in Kartarpur in 1539, having appointed one of his most devoted followers-whom he renamed Angad (my limb)-as his successor. Over time, the community at Kartarpur developed the distinctive elements of the Sikh religious outlook and way of life. Nanak sought to see beyond the illusions of everyday existence in order to achieve sahaj, or union with God. For Nanak, as for his Sant predecessors, God was simultaneously transcendent, or beyond the ordinary range of perceptions, and immediately immanent, or existing within humanity.

Daulat, like other nobles, feared treachery on the part of the Sultan and instead sent his son as an emissary. The cold reception of his son caused Daulat Khan to fear reprisal from the angry Sultan. He invited Babur, a Timurid prince of Kabul, to help him in out in his struggles against the Sultan. With his resources devoted to the east, Ibrahim could do nothing as Babur established himself in Lahore. However, a little too late, Daulat Khan realized that Babur's coming was detrimental to his own interests.
