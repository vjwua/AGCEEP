At the same time, Russia was pushing for her own candidate, the Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, son-in-law of the Czarina Catherine I. After much bribing, negotiation and behind the scene diplomacy, Maurice was summoned to either leave or suffer war. It started in 1727, with Russia firmly committed and sending 8,000 troops to conquer the Duchy within 8 days. The war did not last long enough to embrace all of Europe and Maurice fled to France where he then had a brilliant military career.

The peace that followed the conflict, provoked by the foreign opposition to the Pragmatic Sanction stated by the former Emperor Charles VI and ended with the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, resulted in a well defined rivalry between major European powers forming essentially two main political formations: the alliance of the socalled 'Bourbon family pact' (France, Spain, Naples and the latest Parma, all with members of the same House of Bourbons) with Prussia and the alliance between Austria, Russia and England. Disappointed by England's interested approaches to the emerging power of Prussia wich led to the Convention of Westminster, a treaty with which both countries would avoid any foreign military presence or access in the German territories, Austria strengthened her political ties with Saxony, Russia and Sweden and started new diplomatic handlings with France, traditionally an arch-enemy of the Habsburgs since the old dispute over the Burgundian inheritance but for sure the most powerful antagonist to the rising British colonial empire. And an alliance with France would also mean the support of Spain and the Bourbon Italian monarchies. That diplomatic move would lead to a huge world conflict fought in the years between 1756 and 1763: the socalled 'Seven Years War'.

Internally, the republican party of the Girondins were calling for a war to rid Europe of monarchy and despotism but also to rid France of any internal reactions. Externally, the nobility, the socalled emigrés, fleeing to Austria and Prussia requested that those powers intervene to restore the French monarchy. Louis XVI, King of the French, saw in a war failure the possibility to restore absolutism. But the dissolution of the Ancien Régime in France alarmed all the European royal courts fearing that the French Jacobinism would have spread in the whole continent and provoked deep destabilization inside their own absolutist government systems.

This succeeded in 1814 and again in 1815 when foreign armies brought Louis XVIII on the throne. Louis XVIII was the brother of the Executed King Louis of France and in early life was known as the Comte de Provence. He remained in Paris after the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789 but escaped to Belgium two years later. After King Louis' execution in 1793 he proclaimed himself regent, and after the death of his brother's heir in 1795, he took the title Louis XVIII. He lived as an exile in various European countries until he became King after Napoléon's first abdication in 1814. On Napoléon's return to power in 1815, however, Louis again fled to Belgium
