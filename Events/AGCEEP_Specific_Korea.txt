His military expansion was massive, and he also build several border fortresses along Yalu River where Joseon and Qing shared border. When a band of Dutch sailors including Hendrick Hamel drifted on Jeju Island, he ordered him to build muskets for army, providing muskets to the Koreans for the first time after Seven Year War. However, Qing Dynasty continued to thrive, expanding quickly into west after successfully conquering China in 1644, after putting an end on Ming Dynasty.
