It was in effect a return to Henry's demands before the bulk of Henry's forces had landed in Normandy, and to what the Armagnacs had promised him years before. Charles Duke of Orleans along with Jean Duke of Bourbon, after spending several years as prisoners in London, were ransomed back to France and lent the treaty their full support. Most importantly, Henry V was to renounce his claim to the throne of France. Charles VI was constrained to agree to Henry's proposal. The English were pacified and the Armagnacs claimed political success. Eager to solidify popular support and capture an air of legitimacy, the Kings of England and France, and the Dukes of Bourbon and Orleans would hold a public ceremony in Paris where each swore an extraordinary oath on behalf of themselves and their blood lines to uphold the treaty stipulations. Henry V formally renounced his claim to the throne of France. The Duke of Burgundy, who had stormed out of the Troyes negotiations, refused to attend the ceremonies.

	#-#Duke Philip of Burgundy's father, John 'the Fearless' had slaughtered the Armagnacs, including their leader, Bernard VI, and in turn had been cut down at Montereau in vengeance. In the aftermath of Montereau, Philip threw his lot in with the English. King Henry V had demanded the Crown of France, and to this effect a treaty recognizing Henry as regent and legitimate successor to Charles VI was drafted and signed at Troyes. Duke John's murder at Montereau had demonstrated to Charles VI that his son was unfit for the throne, a decision that was soon ratified by the Parlement in Paris. Those who refused to swear an oath of allegiance to the new order were now traitors and rebels. The Dauphinists, including the remnants of the Armagnac's, were now rebels in the eyes of the Burgundians and the English usurper, and had retreated south of the Loire shortly before Paris was captured. The Treaty commits England to conquer the lands held by the so-called rebels. Charles VI's remaining forces split along their partisan leanings. Many surrendered, some entered active service for Henry V, while others openly declared themselves for Charles, the 'rebel King of Bourges'. Dauphinist sympathies would stall the English campaign for some time as many strongholds to the south and east of Paris continued to resist the English advance. Nevertheless, the Burgundians commanded the city of Troyes which would facilitate Henry's push to link the Burgundian heartland with his newly acquired French posessions. Despite the early opportunity, the treaty was a serious blow to the sole surviving son of Charles VI and legitimate heir of France. Charles's hesitatation would cost him and his supporters dearly in the early phases of Henry V's renewed conflict...

This young man, rather disgraceful in physique, had a difficult puberty and is especially delayed in his intellectual development. This is why his elder sister, Anne of France, stands as regent of France with her husband, Pierre de Beaujeu. If Burgundy had lost the Kingdom of France for lack of a male heir, it was by the regency of a woman that the Valois recovery of the throne would be directed.
