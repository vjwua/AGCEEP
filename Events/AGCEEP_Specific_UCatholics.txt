	#-#Upon the death of Henri II, the Bourbons collected up the new King, Francis II, and his wife, Mary Stuart, now Queen of France and moved them from Châteu des Tournelles to the Louvre. Catherine de Medici decided not to risk staying with her dead husband's body, and followed the 15 year old King, so as to ensure her position on the new royal council of France. Unhappy with their disfavor at court, the Guise family departed for their estates. Citing the kidnapping of their niece and the general perfidy of the reformed faith, they raised the banner of revolt against the Bourbon government.

In September 1584 Henry duke of Guise and his brothers the duke of Mayenne and the Cardinal of Guise met at Nancy and founded league to keep Navarre off the throne. Philip II signed a treaty with the new League, and military operations began at once. By the end of the year, much of north and central France was under Guise control, and France was once again at war.

To be a moderate Catholic was almost as bad as being a heretic to the Leaguers and a popular uprising on the streets of Paris caused Henri III to flee the city. The Catholic League took complete control of the government, welcomed Guise to the city and pressed for a meeting of the Estates-General where they could propose the Cardinal de Bourbon as heir to the crown. There was even a fear that Henri III would be forced to abdicate and that the people might proclaim Guise King. On Christmas Eve in 1588, when Guise was at Blois for the meetings, Henri III invited him to his quarters for some discussion. When he entered, the doors were bolted and although he struggled heroically, he was killed. The same fate was visited on his brother, the Cardinal de Guise. But the younger brother, the Duc of Mayenne, remained alive and became the new leader of the League. Enraged by the treachery of the King, formerly moderate towns rushed to join the League.
