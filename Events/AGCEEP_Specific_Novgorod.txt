Vytautas was still determined to win a crown, but needed a visible success which could be proof of his strong position in eastern Europe and thus strengthen his claims. His first objective was Pskov. In 1426 he invaded the republic and forced it to pay tribute. In 1427 he made the borderland between Lithuania and Muscovy, known as the Wierchovian princedoms, subordinate to himself. It was composed of many small regions, which maintained their independence by maintaining tensions between Lithuania and Muscovy. After subduing Pskov, Vytautas turned his attention to Novgorod. In 1428 he invaded Novgorod and forced it to pay a very high tribute (11,000 rubles).

Vasily II declared war on Novgorod in 1456, after the matter couldn't be resolved peacefully. Muscovy troops defeated Novgorodians and threatened to capture the city. The ensuing peace made Novgorod pay additional 8,500 rubles, return all the lands bought by Novgorodian boyars to Muscovy crown, pay yearly tribute to Muscovy Grand Prince, and agreed to write all laws in the name of Vasily II, and not veche, thus ending the independence of Novgorodian Republic.

The Orthodox Faith never had a head figure like the Pope of the Catholic Faith. It however was mostly guided from Constantinople by the Patriarch there. As the Sunni Muslim Ottomans used the Patriarchs hostage-like situation for there own political gains many Orthodox countries felt appalled and started to loosen the chains of tradition. There had not existed a country as mighty as the Byzantines until...Russia was formed. Russia was created from the notion of full control of all those orthodox people that once had been Christianized from Kiev. This together with the fact that there was only one Orthodox country powerful enough to take up the mantle of the fallen Byzantines made the solution perfect and, thus the Greatest of Princedoms changed into the Empire of Russia.
