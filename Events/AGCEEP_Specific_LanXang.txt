	#-#When King Sam Saen Thai died in 1417, Lan Xang was a power to be reckoned with. His successors, however, were young, inexperienced and mediocre. Around 1427, the eldest daughter of the King Sam Saen Thai, Keava Kumari, started the intrigues behind the throne. Within a short period of 10 years, 8 Kings has risen to the throne, only to be promptly killed on the orders of their aunt (or sister). When she finally mounted the throne herself in 1438, her reign only lasted a few months, as she was deposed on the orders of Council of Ministers, and then tortured to death together with her husband, the Prime-Minister (who was incidentally her grandnephew). During this time span, confusion and instability has reigned in the country.

That caught the eye of the Burmese, and their envy has caused worries at Lan Xang court, which, in turn, led tightening the ties between the courts of Lan Xang and Ayuthaya.
