As the nobles were not interested in any centralization of Georgia, Giorgi soon was released, and was accepted as a leader of Kakheti, but could not even think of trying to regain the throne of a united Georgia. In the meantime, Bagrat, having proclaimed himself as the King of Imereti-Kartli, had barely any supporters in the later, permanently resided in Imereti and beared the title only by word, while in fact, Konstantin II was the true ruler of Kartli.
