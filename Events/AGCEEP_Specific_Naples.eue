	#-#Entering his dominions, the Pope's first task was to restore the State of the Church to the prosperity and order to which it had become a stranger. In doing this he tried to gain external political support which he eventually obtained from Giovanna II of the House of Anjou-Durazzo and Queen of Naples, also known as Giovannetta or the 'Queen-Bee' for her dissolute life. In exchange for the repossession of the Papal territories, which her brother Ladislao formerly occupied when Rome had no ruler, Giovanna was legitimately enthroned Queen of Naples by the Pope in a solemn ceremony held in the city of Naples on 28 October 1419. But the Pope desperately needed troops to bring back the order over the territories of the Papal Legations in Umbria, Marche and Romagna, where the populations rebelled thanks to the abuses perpetrated by Braccio da Montone's mercenaries, and asked Giovanna II for help. Promptly the Queen sent her best condottiero, Muzio Attendolo, 'lo Sforza', commander of Neapolitan troops to help the Pope in his fight for the reacquisition of the Church territories.

Although both Muzio Attendolo Sforza and Braccio da Montone came from the Alberico da Barbiano's Compagnia di Ventura di San Giorgio, they had different approaches to strategic-tactical warfare, the 'Scuola Sforzesca' based mainly upon coordinated field manoeuvres and planned tactics and the 'Scuola Braccesca' based mainly upon energic assaults and the element of surprise. In their first battle against each other Fortebraccio (da Montone's nickname) prevailed. Informed of M. Attendolo Sforza's defeat, having always been hostile to the celebrated condottiero, Gianni Caracciolo, Giovanna's favourite advisor and lover, managed to induce the Queen to refuse the Pope's request of more troops in order to stop da Montone. In spite of her refusal and thanks to the mediation of Florence, Martinus V managed however to come to terms with da Montone promising him a title in exchange for his military services. Finally the Papal troops commanded by Braccio da Montone himself succeeded in retaking the Church territories. As soon as the order in his States was re-established and in order to punish Giovanna for her unexpected refusal to send troops, the Pope offered the crown of Naples to the junior House of the Angevins, always interested in the succession to the throne of Naples, proclaiming Louis III d'Anjou 'King of Naples' on 4 December 1419.

	#-#Giovanna of Anjou-Durazzo was not destined to be Queen, and when she found herself with the crown of Naples on her head after the death of her brother, she refused to give up her previous dissolute life. She soon started to yield the power to whoever happened to be her current paramour. The nobility was restless and conspirative. Pope Martinus V, as his predecessors, wanted to see Naples in the firm hands of a trusted man, but as a previous arranged marriage to Jean of Bourbon had failed, and Giovanna was now 50 years old, he decided to invest Louis III of Anjou, Count of Provence, of the junior branch of the House of Anjou, with claims to Naples. Martinus and Louis recruited the help of Neapolitan condottiero Muzio Attendolo, also known as 'lo Sforza'. When Sforza's army invaded Naples, Giovanna turned to Alfons V of Aragon, who had also distant claims to the crown of Naples, and in exchange for his help, adopted him as heir. Alfons arrived to Naples with his forces, and made Braccio da Montone, Sforza's greatest rival, commander of the Neapolitan armies.

	#-#Alfons of Aragon, after being adopted by Giovanna of Anjou-Durazzo, arrived at the Kingdom of Naples with the intention of being recognised as its legitimate ruler, due mainly to his descent from the last Hohenstaufen King of Sicily, and not due to the will of a member of an usurping dynasty, the House of Anjou. He wanted to take control of Naples immediately without waiting for the Queen's death. He soon imprisoned Caracciolo, Giovanna's lover, but he failed to capture the Queen. Muzio Attendolo Sforza, the Neapolitan condottiero in the service of the Pope, informed that Giovanna was in great danger, went hastily to Naples and rescued her. It was then easy for the Pope to convince the Queen to adopt Louis III of Anjou, Count of Provence, instead of Alfons of Aragon. Taking advantage of the absence of Alfons due to his problems in Aragon, and with the military help of Visconti, Duke of Milan and Signore of Genoa, the Aragonese were expelled from Naples, and Giovanna appointed Louis as Duke of Calabria, the heir's title. Louis moved his court to Cosenza to arrange his stay in Italy.

Pope Eugenius IV declared that as suzerain he had the right to invest the new King and as for now he would send a bishop as temporary regent. However the Neapolitan people, determined to respect the will of their former Queen, ignored the Papal resolution and sent a delegation to Provence to urge René of Anjou to claim the throne in Naples. Since René of Anjou had been taken captive in Burgundy by Duke Philip the Fair, his wife Isabelle of Lorraine accepted the crown in his place. From his base in Sicily, Alfons of Aragon, who was designated heir by Giovanna between 1420 and 1423, and had a claim to Naples as King of Sicily, gained the support of the Neapolitan nobility hostile to the Anjou dynasty, and started making preparations to invade the Kingdom before the French Angevins could arrive in Naples and take the crown.

For three years Alfonso conducted as much a diplomatic war as a military one, gaining allies to his cause from the Neapolitan nobles. In 1438, René of Anjou paid a huge ransom to Burgundy for his release, and arrived in the Kingdom, but since he had exhausted his funds his allies abandoned him and he had to retreat to Naples. A long siege was then established, during which the Infante Don Pedro was killed by a chance shot to the great grief of his brother. The support of the Genoese fleet allowed René to sustain the besieged capital, but finally on June 1, 1442, 300 well-armed men entered the town through an open drain accesible during the dry season, revealed to Alfons' son Ferrante by some prisoners. After several hours of fighting, Naples was conquered and René escaped to Florence. After conquering the rest of the Kingdom, Alfons entered the capital in triumph on February 23, 1443. Pope Eugenius refused to invest Alfons as King of Naples and threatened to declare him in unlawful possession of Naples, Sicily, Corsica and Sardinia. Alfons threatened back with his support for an anti-Pope, Felix V, chosen at the Council of Basel, and Eugenius accepted to invest him in exchange for his support as the genuine Pope and help against the Turks that never materialized. Ferrante was named Prince of Calabria, and the Neapolitans were pleased that their Kingdom was not going to be incorporated to Aragon. Alfons, who as a Castilian had always felt a foreigner in Barcelona, never returned to Aragon, and his court in Naples was filled with the splendor of the Renaissance. Alfons soon gained the nickname of the Magnanimous.

After 2 years and half of life, isolated and surrounded by the unfaithful Sforza, who in the meanwhile and with the support of Venice turned against the city of Milan aiming at the ducal throne, the Ambrosian Republic eventually ceased to exist. Brought to severe famine the citizenship of Milan was forced to surrender to the condottiero and accept him as their new Duke.

All legitimated or self-proclaimed claimants of the Milanese throne, took arms against him. Charles of Orléans and Louis of Savoy because of their family ties with the House of Visconti, Alfons of Aragon because of an alleged secret agreement with the last Visconti Duke which would have entitled him to the duchy of Milan.

	#-#In 1458, in accordance with his father's will, Ferdinando succeeded Alfonso I on the throne of Naples. Ferdinando I, also called Don Ferrante, was the natural son of Alfonso V of Aragon and I of Sicily and Naples. In order to arrange a good future to his bastard son, King Alfonso had him married in 1444 to Isabella of Chiaramonte, a feudal heiress of remarkable feudal possessions in Southern Italy and granddaughter of Maria d'Enghien, Queen consort of Ladislao, the last Angevin King of Naples. But after Alfonso died Pope Calixtus III didn't legitimate Ferdinando as new King of Naples, he declared instead that the line of Aragon was extinct and that the Kingdom was to be considered a fief of the church. Although the Pope died before he could make good his claim and the new Pope Pius II on the contrary recognized Ferdinando, Jean d'Anjou, Duke of Lorraine and René's son, also known as 'Duke of Calabria', profiting by the discontent of the pro-Angevin Neapolitan barons, decided to attempt to regain the throne of his ancestors and invaded Naples. The war started well for the Anjou with the easy occupation of Apulia and the temporary control of Naples after the victorious battle of Sarno in 1460. Ferdinand was so severely defeated that his Kingdom seemed to be completely lost in Angevin hands, but with the military help of Francesco Sforza, Duke of Milan, through his brother Alessandro and of the Albanian leader Gjergj Kastrioti, known as 'Skanderbeg', who came to the aid of the prince whose father had aided him, he triumphed over his enemies in the battle of Troja in 1462. By 1464 Ferdinando could re-establish his authority in the Kingdom, Jean d'Anjou left Southern Italy while the barons agreed to recognize the Aragonese as their King.

Francesco Sforza, ruler of Milan and Venice, the chief state of the league confederates, who was more and more threatened by the advancing Ottomans in her eastern Mediterranean territories, convened a cease-fire while a bilateral treaty was hastily signed in Lodi on 7 April 1454. With that treaty Sforza was legitimated Duke of Milan. Without even being called for, Florence and the Pope had no choice then to endorse the treaty. The King of Naples, being a rightful claimant on the ducal throne reluctantly joined the alliance under the condition to keep Genoa out of it. Intended 'infra terminos italicos', that treaty showed the objective impossibility for all the Italian major powers (specifically Milan, Tuscany, Venice, Naples and Papal States) to prevail upon each other in the struggle for the hegemony in Italy and that the better solution was to come to terms with each other. That would have also avoided the practice of very expensive and pointless wars in the next future. Although the treaty actually played a minor part in Italian balance of powers and so won't be able to avoid future wars of aggression from inside as well from outside Italy, the post-Lodi era historically represented a period of relative peace in which the figurative arts definitively flourished in the whole Italian peninsula, as well as economy and trade and, last but not the least, the skills and tricks of the art of diplomacy.

	#-#Because of his distrustfulness of the barons, Ferdinando was pursuing a policy aimed at strengthening royal authority at the expense of them, that attitude brought him to have many enemies amongst the nobles of the Kingdom. In 1485, when his son, Alfonso Duke of Calabria, decided to revoke all the privileges that granted the city of Aquila a certain political autonomy towards the Kingdom, arresting the local nobles and occupying the city with his troops, the city magistrates refused to submit to him chasing the Neapolitan troops away and asking Pope Innocentius VIII for help and protection. The Pope, already put out by the fact that King Ferdinando didn't pay the 'chinea' (the annual tribute a Neapolitan fief has to give to the Pope as suzerain), accepted to help by sending troops to Aquila. In a rally immediately arranged in Melfi to discuss about Alfonso's aggression to Aquila, the nobles led by Antonello Petrucci, Count of Policastro and Francesco Coppola, Count of Sarno, King's ministers and by Antonello Sanseverino, Prince of Salerno, all hostile to the Aragonese rule, agreed to revolt against the King, who in the meanwhile refused to come to terms with them and confirm their feudal privileges. The revolt resulted in a civil war by which both Papal and Neapolitan territories were systematically devastated by the contending armies. On 11 august 1486 a permanent truce was eventually signed between Ferdinando, the Pope and the rebelling nobles, The King of Naples promised to pay the tribute due to the Church, to forgive the unfaithful barons and to assign Aquila under the Papal suzerainty.

In January 1487 during a wedding-feast arranged in Castel Nuovo (aka Maschio Angioino) in Naples, the King completed his fierce personal retaliations. He deceitfully invited the nobles who had taken part in the baronal revolts with the aim to have them all arrested, then after arguable trials all the nobles were sentenced to death. Rumours had that some of them were simply closed in bags and thrown in the sea, leaving no traces. As a last macabre act, Ferdinando ordered that corpses of the conspirators should be mummified and then permanently exposed in the Castel Nuovo as a warning to all the Neapolitan subjects. The break of the truce indeed displeased the Pope who didn't even receive the city of Aquila as previously agreed. Innocentius VIII will proclaim the vacancy of the throne of Naples.

In order to enforce peace, Ludovico Sforza, regent of the duchy followed the traditional Milanese attitude to stipulate political marriages, which his father Francesco begun with the 1454 treaty of Lodi. A political marriage was arranged to strengthen the relations between the ducal court of Milan and the royal court of Naples between the Duke of Milan, Gian Galeazzo and Isabella d'Aragona, granddaughet of Ferrante, King of Naples. The ceremony took place in 1488 in Naples but the wedding was confirmed in Milan only the following year.

Isabella, member of a royal dynasty, couldn't accept to renounce the right to rule in Milan and nevertheless to play a second role at the ducal court. She then complained to her father Alfonso, Duke of Calabria, about her segregation in the ducal court and asked for an immediate political or military intervention in favour of her husband Gian Galeazzo, who dared not to retake his legitimate power. By this, Alfonso, Ferrante's son and future King of Naples, had the occasion for pressing his claims to the throne of Milan, which Filippo Maria, the last Duke of the Viscontis, seemingly promised to his grandfather, Alfonso I, before death caught him in 1447 and the war for succession in Milan started.

	#-#The French claim on the throne of Naples was unpopular with many of the Italian states, nevertheless, they were all cowed at first by the fierce conduct of war of the French army and by the powerful artillery Charles VIII had at disposal. However King Ferdinando I of Naples sought the diplomatic way, asking Charles VIII for the renewal of the treaties he had previously stipulated with Louis XI and to eventually submit the controversy to the Pope's high decision. As a clear answer to that his ambassadors were just ordered to leave France immediately. Then Ferdinando II managed to reconcile with Pope Alexander VI and that made Ludovico Sforza so suspicious as to request an immediate French intervention in the Kingdom of Naples. On 25 January 1494 Ferdinando II died and his son Alfonso succeeded to the throne. Alfonso's first successful diplomatic move was the alliance with Florence and Papal States. Fearing the French himself, Pope Alexander VI preferred to have Alfonso II as new King in Naples. But as soon as the French King, Charles VIII, moved towards Naples, part of the Kingdom defected from Naples and swore allegiance to the new liege. Also Alfonso II didn't want to face the aggression and abdicated in favour of his son Ferdinando (II) who arranged for resistance instead. While the French army did show its fierceness in Italy by slaughtering and pillaging the villages that didn't want to pay homage, no army seemed intentioned to face the invaders: instead of opposing the French, deals were made with them to avoid battle. Facing with a disbanding army and with a turmoil that broke out in the city of Naples, Ferdinando II was forced to leave his Kingdom and flee to Sicily under the protection of his cousin King Ferdinand of Aragon. On 22 february 1495 Charles VIII King of France entered the city of Naples distributing money to the populace. As a French diplomat, Philippe de Commynes, wrote in his Memoires, the French King took 4 months and 19 days only to reach Naples from Asti, an ambassador would take just a little less. Charles VIII didn't face any enemy army, so it was said he conquered Italy with 'wooden spurs' and 'chalk' used to assign lodgings to his troops. But the Italian diplomacy was already at work, looking for military support against the French aggression.

	#-#The presence of Charles VIII of France in the Kingdom of Naples scared the Italian princes, who had in a certain way permitted the French King to achieve his goal of settling there almost undisturbed. Venice and Florence were worried about a French hegemony in the peninsula. French military presence wasn't limited to Southern Italy but also to villages of Tuscany and the Papal States, which previously surrendered to Charles VIII in his march towards Naples, strategically located to grant the French military supply line. The Pope, who previously granted the French King military access through the Papal territories and consented his stay in Rome, felt in jeopardy as much as to refuse Charles VIII being proclaimed King of Naples. Also King Ferdinand of Aragon couldn't accept the French presence in a Kingdom where he instead, in spite of Alfons V's testament which assigned Naples to the other Trastamara branch, could be the one to have claims there. The position of Naples was also important for the Aragonese trading in the Mediterranean. The Duke of Milan, who decisively affected Charles VIII's decision to settle in Naples, was now alarmed by the presence of French reserve troops deployed in the county of Asti, very close to Milan and at the order of the Duke of Orléans, who had dynastical claims to the Milanese throne. So Venice, Milan, the Pope, Spain and even the Holy Roman Empire (so firmly opposed to the French expansionism in Italy as to join any Anti-French alliance available) consequently formed the Anti-French league in Venice on 31 March 1495. Florence preferred to stay out because of her internal problems caused by Charles VIII's passage and decided to support France instead. Having heard about those arrangements and fearing that the confederates would isolate his army in Italy, Charles VIII decided to return to France for reinforcements leaving his regent in Naples. He had to move his army quickly through the Apennines as to reach the Alps and then safety, but the presence of heavy artilleries and carriages transporting the big loot he accumulated across Italy, slowed his march down. Only at Fornovo on the Taro River, in the Po Valley, Charles VIII finally faced the army of the confederates. Despite having lost all the carriages, he managed to reach the Alps gaining from his expedition to Italy nothing but his army decimated by epidemies.

At those times Naples was both a great port and a very populated city and sailors who had sailed with Columbus a few years earlier had allegedly imported the new disease from the New World. However even if the French would call it 'le mal de Naples' and the Italians simply 'il mal franzese' it is certain that the French Army returning north helped this malady spread across Italy and eventually to all of Europe where it was known as 'the French disease'. Ferradino, now Ferdinando II King of Naples, didn't enjoy his realm for a long time as he died of malaria when he was only 23. Having died heirless, his uncle Federico, Alfonso II's brother, rose to the throne as Federico III. He was a weak monarch whose unhappy diplomatic moves to appease France, even acknowledging his realm as a French fief, and to encourage diplomatic relations with the Turk would let the Kingdom be prey of foreign powers. Ferdinand of Aragon, who didn't deny to disconfess Alfons V's testament to keep the crown of Naples separate from those of Aragon and Sicily, feared that the defense of Naples, crucial to the Aragonese trading in the Mediterranean, could no longer be entrusted to his relative. He had to face the difficult choice of either going to war against France or splitting the Kingdom of Naples with them. When Federico refused a marriage between his son Ferrandino, Duke of Calabria, and Ferdinand's niece, Juana de Aragón, Ferdinand of Aragon definitively resolved to come to terms with the French King signing the treaty of Granada. The fate of Naples was then written.

Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba met more resistance in the siege of Taranto, defended by Federico's son Ferdinando. Ferdinando surrendered Taranto to Spain on March 1502, and Fernando of Aragon did not keep Cordoba's promise of personal freedom to him, asking Cordoba to send him to Spain.

But the Kings had neglected to properly divide the regions of the Kingdom, leaving the Principati, the Basilicata and the Capitanata between both parts unassigned. The French denied that Capitanata (a land on which both Apulia and Abruzzi depended for food and flock wintering) was part of Apulia arguing recent administrative usage, and refused to allow the commissaries of Spain to collect the tolls on migrating flocks as the treaty stipulated. Soon incidents were taking place and open war broke out in July 1502. But the lack of decision by the French to attack when they had the advantage, the skill of Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba and the delays of Louis in bringing reinforcements will see the French expelled from Naples in one year. Completely defeated in Naples by Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba, Louis XII of France agreed at Blois in October of 1505 to cede his rights over Naples to his relative Germaine de Foix on her marriage to Fernando of Aragon.

Southern Italy became more removed from the mainstream of European development and the administration of Naples lagged behind that of their European contemporaries. The practice of agriculture as prevailing economic activity meant the coming back to power of the most conservative landowning aristocracy. while the receding of the naval threat from Muslim powers in the Mediterranean Naples also became much less militarized. That economic backwardness associated with the effects of Counterreform deeply affected Italian social life too, now less and less inclined to accept innovation and to develop some entrepreneurial attitude.

He hoped in this way to secure Mantua for the elder son, Don Carlos, who, already Duke of Parma as Carlo I, had also the expectation of Tuscany and to give the Kingdoms of Naples and Sicily to the younger son, Don Felipe. Since Austria was fighting on several fronts on the Rhine against France and on Lombardia against Savoy, Spain easily conquered Naples and Sicily which Austria had previously occupied during the war of Spanish succession. In 1735 the peace treaty that followed the war of Polish succession established that Felipe's son Carlos (later Charles III of Spain) should give up the duchy of Parma, which he had inherited in 1731 as descent of the Farnese family through his mother, Elisabetta Farnese, Queen of Spain and any claim to Tuscany, given to the Duke of Lorraine after Gian Gastone, the last of the Medicis, died. In exchange for that, Don Carlos was confirmed the possession of his conquests in Southern Italy. On 3 October 1735 Don Carlos, named Carlo VII King of Naples and Carlo V King of Sicily, established the cadet line of the Spanish House of Bourbons in the Kingdoms of Naples and Sicily (renamed Kingdom of Two Sicilies after 1815).

Although the new army was able to fend off an Austrian invasion in 1744, the reforms failed in their ultimate goals.

The peace that followed the conflict, provoked by the foreign opposition to the Pragmatic Sanction stated by the former Emperor Charles VI and ended with the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, resulted in a well defined rivalry between major European powers forming essentially two main political formations: the alliance of the socalled 'Bourbon family pact' (France, Spain, Naples and the latest Parma, all with members of the same House of Bourbons) with Prussia and the alliance between Austria, Russia and England. Disappointed by England's interested approaches to the emerging power of Prussia wich led to the Convention of Westminster, a treaty with which both countries would avoid any foreign military presence or access in the German territories, Austria strengthened her political ties with Saxony, Russia and Sweden and started new diplomatic handlings with France, traditionally an arch-enemy of the Habsburgs since the old dispute over the Burgundian inheritance but for sure the most powerful antagonist to the rising British colonial empire. And an alliance with France would also mean the support of Spain and the Bourbon Italian monarchies. That diplomatic move would lead to a huge world conflict fought in the years between 1756 and 1763: the socalled 'Seven Years War'.

	#-#As soon as Napoléon returned to France in his lasts attempts to preserve his Empire in the socalled Hundred Days, Joachim Murat, also called King Gioacchino Napoleone in Naples, decided this time to give his full support to his imperial brother-in-law and started gathering troops, the socalled 'murattiani'. In his proclamation of Rimini, the King of Naples meant to raise voluntary troops in the last attempt to defend his Kingdom and, in the same time, to expand in other Italian territories as to achieve a stronger position in a future peace treaty with the 7th Coalition. But his calls to the national pride of a population, which had never considered herself as one Italian population until then, remained unheard. After he failed to cross the Po River, King Gioacchino reorganized his troops in the Papal Marches and decided to wait for an Austrian army which was descending Italy to restore the Bourbons in Naples. What shall we do? Face the Austrian troops and defend our Kingdom or ignominiously abdicate and leave Italy to her destiny?

	#-#Rossini studied in Bologna and began his operatic career when, at 18, he wrote a one-act comedy for Venice. Further commissions followed, from Bologna, Ferrara, Venice again and Milan. His first operas to win international acclaim come from 1813: the serious 'Tancredi' and the comic 'L'italiana in Algieri'. In 1815 Rossini went to Naples as musical and artistic director of the Teatro San Carlo, which led to a concentration on serious opera. From this time date two of his supreme comedies: 'Il barbiere di Siviglia' and 'La Cenerentola'. The former, with its elegant melodies, its exhilarating rhythms and its superb ensemble writing, has claims to be considered the greatest of all Italian comic operas, eternally fresh in its wit and its inventiveness. The next year saw 'La Cenerentola', a charmingly sentimental tale in which the heroine moves from a touching folksy ditty to brilliant coloratura apt to a royal maiden.
