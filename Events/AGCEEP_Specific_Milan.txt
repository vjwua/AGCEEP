Not appeased by those political successes Visconti turned his greedy ambitions on central Italy, prosecuting interrupted family's ambitious policies to expand the duchy under River Po towards Romagna. In fact, his father Gian Galeazzo, obsessed by the dream of a reborn Lombard Kingdom, spent the whole life in trying to conquer all the Italian Imperial lands to be united under the same Milanese rule. Only death dissuaded him from accomplishing his proposed task. A newly presented favourable chance was the death of Giorgio degli Ordelaffi, Lord of Forlì in Romagna : Visconti gained the support of the local nobles in establishing his own Lordship as ward of Tebaldo, Giorgio's son. That of course displeased the neighbouring cities and above all Florence, with which Milan stipulated a peace treaty in 1420 as to guarantee 10 years of non-belligerence.

He wanted to take control of Naples immediately without waiting for the Queen's death. He soon imprisoned Caracciolo, Giovanna's lover, but he failed to capture the Queen. Muzio Attendolo Sforza, the Neapolitan condottiero in the service of the Pope, informed that Giovanna was in great danger, went hastily to Naples and rescued her. It was then easy for the Pope to convince the Queen to adopt Louis III of Anjou, Count of Provence, instead of Alfons of Aragon. Taking advantage of the absence of Alfons due to his problems in Aragon, and with the military help of Visconti, Duke of Milan and Signore of Genoa, the Aragonese were expelled from Naples, and Giovanna appointed Louis as Duke of Calabria, the heir's title. Louis moved his court to Cosenza to arrange his stay in Italy.

The triumphant condottiero felt greatly aggrieved and most of all betrayed. After a harsh dispute with the Duke, he failed to obtain a personal interview with him. So, fearing for his life and seeking revenge on Visconti he managed to flee to Savoy and then to Venice, Milan's arch-enemy, where he offered his services.

At first, he wasn't well received in Venice, for he was the most famous of Milanese condottieri and a real threat to the Republic. But as soon as the Venetians knew that Visconti imprisoned his family and confiscated all of his estates and that conspirators at the service of Visconti attempted to poison him, Carmagnola was appointed captain-general of St Mark in 1426 and the Antivisconti league-confederates declared war on Milan. Carmagnola's most important success was the battle of Maclodio (1427), but he did not follow it up. The Republic, impatient of his dilatoriness, raised his emoluments and promised him immense fiefs including the lordship of Milan, so as to increase his ardour, but in vain. At the same time Carmagnola was perpetually receiving messengers from Visconti, who offered him great rewards if he would abandon the Venetians.The general trifled with his past as with his present employers, believing in his foolish vanity that he held the fate of both in his hand. But the Venetians were dangerous masters to trifle with and their patience was soon to be lost...

It was to the interest of all soldiers of fortune of both sides to make the operations last as long as possible, to avoid decisive operations and to liberate all prisoners quickly. Consequently the campaign were very exhausting and dragged on interminably, some battles were won and others lost, truces and peace treaties were made only to be broken, and no definite result was achieved. A peace treaty was also stipulated in Ferrara in 1428 in which at first Visconti stated to renounce claims to territories lying beyond the Panaro-Magra Rivers, but refused to concede the territories of Bergamo and Brescia to Venice, which was still occupying with her troops. Political and economic interests of both sides were conflicting and when the new Pope, Eugenius IV, was being suspected of involvement with the League to damage Milan, Visconti retaliated sending his troops to invade the Papal States. That represented a violation of the peace treaty and subsequently a new Antivisconti League was formed to wage war against Milan.

Alfons of Aragon was defeated and captured by a Genovese fleet at the battle of Ponza in 1435. Transferred to Milan, Alfons succeeded in gaining Visconti's favour to his cause against the French Angevins. He convinced Filippo Maria that a French presence in Italy could be against the interests of Milan since the House of Orléans had never hidden its dynastic claims on the Duchy of Milan. But Genoa, a bitter rival of Aragon during centuries of dispute over Sardinia, Corsica, and the control of the Western Mediterranean trade, was appalled by Visconti's sudden change of sides, and immediately asked for admission in the Venetian-Florentine league against her former suzerain.

Facing a new and stronger League, whose troops were commanded by Francesco Sforza, Filippo Maria succeeded in asking the condottiero to mediate with the League-confederates for an immediate peace. In exchange for that service, Sforza married Visconti's daughter Bianca Maria. Since Visconti hadn't yet any direct male heir, Sforza would be in condition to claim the throne at Visconti's death. In the treaty signed in Cremona in 1441 Venice obtained the suzerainty over the cities of Brescia, Bergamo and Ravenna while Visconti had to confirm the independence of Genoa and to give up definitely his ambitious plan of a reborn Lombard Kingdom in Northern Italy.

For three years Alfons conducted as much a diplomatic war as a military one, gaining allies to his cause from the Neapolitan nobles. In 1438, René of Anjou paid a huge ransom to Burgundy for his release, and arrived in the Kingdom, but since he had exhausted his funds his allies abandoned him and he had to retreat to Naples. A long siege was then established, during which the Infante Don Pedro was killed by a chance shot to the great grief of his brother. The support of the Genoese fleet allowed René to sustain the besieged capital with success until 1 June 1442, when 300 Aragonese well-armed men entered the town through an open drain accessible during the dry season, revealed to Alfons' son Ferrante by some prisoners. After several hours of fighting and in spite of the stealthy move inside the city walls, Naples withstood the Aragonese and Alfons was forced to retreat to Sicily. After recovering the rest of the Kingdom, René entered the capital in triumph the year after. Pope Eugenius IV, very happy for the Angevin success, invested René as King of Naples and Sicily thus declaring Alfons of Aragon in unlawful possession of the Sicilian island.

Pope Eugenius refused to invest Alfons as King of Naples and threatened to declare him in unlawful possession of Naples, Sicily, Corsica and Sardinia. Alfons threatened back with his support for an anti-Pope, Felix V, chosen at the Council of Basel, and Eugenius accepted to invest him in exchange for his support as the genuine Pope and help against the Turks that never materialized. Ferrante was named Prince of Calabria, and the Neapolitans were pleased that their Kingdom was not going to be incorporated to Aragon. Alfons, who as a Castilian had always felt a foreigner in Barcelona, never returned to Aragon, and his court in Naples was filled with the splendor of the Renaissance. Alfons soon gained the nickname of the Magnanimous.

Encouraged by that and as to continued her war of conquest Venice tried to renew her old alliance with Florence. But Florence was now ruled by Cosimo de Medici, a Sforza's friend, who instead resolved to support the condottiero in order to check Venice and her expansionist policy in Terraferma. The traditionally good relations Florence held with France allowed Sforza to receive Charles VII's military support in his fight against their common enemy Alfons of Aragon who was ruling over Naples at the expenses of Angevin claims. Sforza's good relations with the French King, and consequently with the Houses of Orléans and Anjou, induced the duke of Savoy to make peace with the condottiero and to acknowledge him as the new master of Milan. Only Venice and Naples persevered in their fight against Sforza.

Francesco Sforza, ruler of Milan and Venice, the chief state of the league confederates, who was more and more threatened by the advancing Ottomans in her eastern Mediterranean territories, convened a cease-fire while a bilateral treaty was hastily signed in Lodi on 7 April 1454. With that treaty Sforza was legitimated Duke of Milan. Without even being called for, Florence and the Pope had no choice then to endorse the treaty. The King of Naples, being a rightful claimant on the ducal throne reluctantly joined the alliance under the condition to keep Genoa out of it. Intended 'infra terminos italicos', that treaty showed the objective impossibility for all the Italian major powers (specifically Milan, Tuscany, Venice, Naples and Papal States) to prevail upon each other in the struggle for the hegemony in Italy and that the better solution was to come to terms with each other. That would have also avoided the practice of very expensive and pointless wars in the next future. Although the treaty actually played a minor part in Italian balance of powers and so won't be able to avoid future wars of aggression from inside as well from outside Italy, the post-Lodi era historically represented a period of relative peace in which the figurative arts definitively flourished in the whole Italian peninsula, as well as economy and trade and, last but not the least, the skills and tricks of the art of diplomacy.

Cicco Simonetta gained the favour of Prospero Adorno, once opposer to Galeazzo's rule thus releasing him from prison, with the promise to crush the revolt and reeastablish the Milanese rule over Genoa. Adorno occupied Genoa and became Governor for Milan. But Adorno started to have contacts with foreing rulers seemingly as to get independence from the duke of Milan and that represented a clear sign of rebellion.

Silk, already regarded as an oriental product, became more generally used during the 1440s when Filippo Maria Visconti brought in craftsmen from Lucca, Florence and Genoa, specialised in making high-quality velvets and gold and silver brocades. It did not take long for the new craft to become a leader in Milan especially for 'auroserici' fabrics (using metallised thread, spinning gold and silver together with silk) that became famous throughout Europe. The splendour of the Visconti and Sforza courts was a powerful incentive for the silk factories. In 1461 The Art of Silk was improved with the approval of the Statutes of Weavers and Merchants and in 1470 several decrees were issued to facilitate the mulberry growing in the duchy of Milan. In 1486 Ludovico il Moro ordered the construction of 'La Sforzesca', a farm near the city of Vigevano used for growing mulberries and silkworms.

Florence, ruled by a foolish Piero de' Medici, was shifting his political attitude towards Naples at the expenses of Milan, so that Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan, quite paranoiac, abandoned the old league formed with strain by il Magnifico between Florence, Naples and Milan as to counterbalance Venice and Rome and signed on 22 April 1493 an Act of Confederation with the new Pope Alexander VI inviting Venice to join in. Ferrante I of Naples replied officially pressing Ludovico to resign from his regency of Milan since Gian Galeazzo Sforza, il Moro's nephew and Duke of Milan had already come of age and able to rule the duchy alone. Ferrante threatened to declare Ludovico usurper, and Ludovico decided to bring a bigger threat over Ferrante's head. Charles' ambitions to claim the Angevin throne of Naples were well known to Ludovico Sforza who, convinced to definitely solve his problems with the King of Naples, sent his ambassadors, the Count of Belgioioso and the Count of Caiazzo, to speak to the great lords of the Royal Council of France convincing them of the legality of Charles VIII's claim to the Kingdom of Naples, of the weakness of the Neapolitan armies, and of the glory the conquest of Naples would bring to France, once a crusade to liberate the Holy Land was in planning. At the same time, some Neapolitan exiles in France, amongst them Antonello Sanseverino, who escaped the baronal persecutions in Naples in 1487, assured that the Neapolitan people would have agreed on a French intervention. Most of the great lords of the Royal Council were against an attack on Naples, seeing it as very expensive and very dangerous and most of all senseless. But the young Charles VIII, who was carried away by a thirst for glory and a desire to conquer the Kingdom of Naples, paid very little attention to their arguments and heard instead the advice of his own advisors, many of them already corrupted by the money and promises of il Moro's emissaries with the lure of getting land and estates in the Kingdom of Naples and ecclesiastical positions from the Pope. Finally, after several days' debate, Charles VIII signed a secret agreement with il Moro's ambassadors, by which it was agreed that Charles VIII would send an army to invade the Kingdom of Naples and Milan would provide troops, money and free passage.

	#-#The presence of Charles VIII of France in the Kingdom of Naples scared the Italian princes, who had in a certain way permitted the French King to achieve his goal of settling there almost undisturbed. Venice and Florence were worried about a French hegemony in the peninsula. French military presence wasn't limited to Southern Italy but also to villages of Tuscany and the Papal States, which previously surrendered to Charles VIII in his march towards Naples, strategically located to grant the French military supply line. The Pope, who previously granted the French King military access through the Papal territories and consented his stay in Rome, felt in jeopardy as much as to refuse Charles VIII being proclaimed King of Naples. Also King Ferdinand of Aragon couldn't accept the French presence in a Kingdom where he instead, in spite of Alfons V's testament which assigned Naples to the other Trastamara branch, could be the one to have claims there. The position of Naples was also important for the Aragonese trading in the Mediterranean. The Duke of Milan, who decisively affected Charles VIII's decision to settle in Naples, was now alarmed by the presence of French reserve troops deployed in the county of Asti, very close to Milan and at the order of the Duke of Orléans, who had dynastical claims to the Milanese throne. So Venice, Milan, the Pope, Spain and even the Holy Roman Empire (so firmly opposed to the French expansionism in Italy as to join any Anti-French alliance available) consequently formed the Anti-French league in Venice on 31 March 1495. Florence preferred to stay out because of her internal problems caused by Charles VIII's passage and decided to support France instead. Having heard about those arrangements and fearing that the confederates would isolate his army in Italy, Charles VIII decided to return to France for reinforcements leaving his regent in Naples. He had to move his army quickly through the Apennines as to reach the Alps and then safety, but the presence of heavy artilleries and carriages transporting the big loot he accumulated across Italy, slowed his march down. Only at Fornovo on the Taro River, in the Po Valley, Charles VIII finally faced the army of the confederates. Despite having lost all the carriages, he managed to reach the Alps gaining from his expedition to Italy nothing but his army decimated by epidemies.

	#-#On 7 April 1498, upon Charles VIII's death at Amboise (he knocked his head while passing through a doorway in his going to see a game of real tennis), the throne passed to his cousin Louis of Orléans, who reigned as Louis XII of France. On his accession, he took the titles of Duke of Milan and King of Sicily, sending a shrounding chill through Italy, especially to Ludovico Sforza, who had seized Milan from his nephew Gian Galeazzo, and that upon his death, had seen his claim legitimized by Maximilian King of the Romans. Louis XII came to throne in France with the clear idea of avenging his previous defeat by Ludovico and make good his claim to Milan from his Visconti grandmother. Milan and her dependency, Genoa, were seen as the key to Italy. So Louis XII, preparing to make good his claim on Milan, wanted to enlist the help of the main Italian powers, to avoid the mistakes of his cousin Charles VIII. In the meanwhile the anti-Venetian sentiment had been running high, attempts were made by Italian ambassadors to poison the relationships between Venice and the Ottoman Empire and try to induce the latter to declare war to the former. It was clear that Venice could very well side with the French and that occurred with the stipulation of the treaty of Blois, where Venice would recognize French claims to Milan and in exchange for military support and money would receive the Milanese territories east of the Adda river. Louis then stipulated a peace treaty with Ferdinand of Spain and enforced the truce with Maximilian of Habsburg. He made also a pact with Pope Alexander VI: in exchange for a papal bull to annul his marriage to the crippled sister of late Charles VIII and marry Charles' widow, Anne of Brittany, the Pope's son, Cesare Borgia, received the duchy of Valentinois with the hand of Charlotte d'Albret, sister to the King of Navarre and a promise of French military support to form his own duchy in Romagna. After having secured his friendship with Philibert II of Savoy Louis XII crossed the Alps and assembled his powerful army in Asti, a small county in Piedmont that belonged to the House of Orléans as marriage dowry of Valentina Visconti, his grandmother. In the summer of 1499, the French army led by Gian Giacomo Trivulzio, a Milanese noble, invaded the duchy of Milan from West, in the meanwhile, a Venetian army attacked from East. Town after town surrendered and the Milanese armies disappeared. As soon as a revolt broke out in Milan, Ludovico left the city together with his family and his treasure.

	#-#When in 1499 the French troops invaded Milan, Ludovico il Moro escaped to Innsbruck in Austria at the court of Maximilian I to ask his protection. Louis XII remained in Milan only a couple of months, then he made return to France and left Trivulzio there as his viceroy. But Trivulzio's way to administrate provoked deep Milanese resentments as much as to long for a Sforza's return and in January 1500, hearing that Sforza was assemblying troops to conquer Milan, an Anti-French revolt broke out in the city, the french troops were forced to abandon Milan except the garrison in Castello Sforzesco. In facts, with the gold he brought with, il Moro could hire mercenary troops and by February 1500 he made his entrance in Milan. After Milan, Sforza retook all the cities in the duchy and beyond Ticino River, where in Novara he had to face a French counterattack led by La Trémouille, also hiring Swiss mercenaries. The Swiss troops hired by il Moro, probably lured by the French gold and incited by their fellow-countrymen in the opposite camp refused to fight. 'The Duke's forces were composed of different races: German 'landsknechte', Burgundians who were commanded by the same Claude de Vauldray who had fought with the Good Knight in his first tournament, and Swiss mercenaries. There were bands of Swiss fighting on the side of the French, and those within the city declared that they would not fight against their fellow-countrymen in the other camp. They laid down their arms, and neither threat nor promise availed. Soon it was discovered that one of the gates of Novara had been opened by treachery, and that the French were entering the city. Then, as a last hope, Ludovico and his companions put on the dress of common soldiers and mixed with them in the ranks. But the unfortunate Duke was betrayed by one of the Swiss captains, who was put to death later by his own countrymen as a traitor.'(Bayard: The Good Knight Without Fear And Without Reproach, e-book by Christopher Hare) Ludovico Sforza was recognised and captured, then sent as prisoner to France where he miserably died, some years later, in the Castle of Loches, in Turenne. On 15 April 1500 The French troops made their second entrance in Milan.

	#-#In spite of their victories in Northern Italy, the French troops were forced to abandon the battlefield both because of financial reasons and because after the successful battle of Ravenna the Emperor was withdrawing troops and would have joined the holy league formed by Papal States, Spain, England and Venice with the help of Swiss troops hired by Pope Julius II himself and led into war by the Bishop of Sion, Mathias Schiner. Thence the decision to withdraw from Milan. Julius II recovered Ravenna, Bologna and the rest of the Romagna, while his commander, the Duke of Urbino, easily occupied Reggio and Modena, though Alfonso d'Este refused any settlement that would deprive him of Ferrara. After having chased out the French from Italy, the congress of allies which met at Mantua in August made over to the Pope Parma and Piacenza, to which he had at best a shadowy claim. The Emperor and Fernando would have been glad to give Milan to their grandson Charles but the Swiss were in possession and, supported by the Pope, made their will good. The duchy was given to Ercole Massimiliano Sforza, the elder son of Ludovico. The Venetian claims were left unsettled with Brescia still held out and the Swiss claiming Cremona and the Ghiara d'Adda for the duchy. And more, the Emperor demanded Vicenza and Verona. Florence, who in 1509 had ended her long war by the recovery of Pisa, was punished for her support of France by the restoration of the Medici. Entering Milan, Ercole Massimiliano Sforza received the keys to the city from the Swiss soldiers, who promised to protect the duchy of Milan and to help the Duke in sending to him all the troops he would need. The Duke granted them the acquisition of the ducal territories Ticino and Valtellina, the most important accesses to the Alpine passes. Genoa drew back its allegiance to the French King, who in 1506 harshly repressed a local rebellion that broke out owing to the decision taken by the French governor to grant privileges to the nobilty. But Julius II made also a treaty with his late ally, Maximilian, against Venice. The emperor was to support the Lateran council to oppose that one proclaimed by Louis XII in Pisa and to hand over Modena to the Pope, while Julius II was to join in compelling Venice to give up the fiefs which the Emperor claimed since Cambrai and to use on behalf of his new ally also the always convincing 'spiritual weapons'. When this treaty was made public, it had only the effect to drive Venice to side with France.

	#-#On 28 June 1519 after the death of his grand-father, the Emperor Maximilian I of Habsburg, Charles, King of Spain and Duke of Burgundy, became Holy Roman Emperor thanks to the money of his bankers (Fuggers and Welsers mainly) in a very expensive struggle with François Ier King of France. Having proclaimed himself as the only legitimate heir of Charlemagne, the first Emperor of Frankish dynasty, François Ier had announced his candidature to the imperial election. As a matter of facts all the electors were heavily bribed in order to obtain the much desired vote, and that was standard practice at those times. Charles 'bought' the Imperial title paying the Great Electors and their emissaries the huge sum of 850,000 golden florins (equal to a value of Kg 2,100 of gold). That money came mainly from the Castilian rents as the New World still didn't provide with much income. Charles's election was also eased by the Army of the Svevian league, which impressed the doubtful electors when chasing the Duke of Wirtemberg, chief of the pro-French party, out of his duchy. That denied the last remote chance for François to win the election. Being elected Holy Roman Emperor as Charles V, Charles (Karl in the German world or Carlos in Spain) of the House of Habsburg obtained the rights of suzerainty over all the fiefs in the Holy Roman Empire. Amongst them the Duchy of Milan together with its sovereignty of the Republic of Genoa represented an important junction in the Habsburg's dominions, the socalled 'Spanish road'.

Many French leaders died on the battlefield, such as De la Tremoille, La Palice and Bonnivet. King François Ier, instead, fell from his horse shot out under him, and taken captive. Since 24 February was Charles V's 25th birthday, the Valois was the biggest gift he could ever receive. François was carted off to Madrid, where he was held six months in prison for ransom, and pressed to renounce his claims in Italy and Flanders, to give Bourgogne back to the Empire and to concede the county of Provence to Charles, Connétable de Bourbon, and now leader of the imperial troops. The Emperor believed that the peace with France had finally been achieved after François Ier, agreeing to renounce his claims in Italy, was freed and retaken to France, leaving his sons there as hostages and guarantees for the respect of the treaty. But within two months of his release and in spite of his sons taken as hostages in Spain, François Ier got the Parliament of Paris to void all the terms of the Treaty of Madrid because accepted under duress and in 1526 at Cognac he stipulated a holy league bringing into it Pope Clement VII together with Florence, Venice, Henry VIII of England and also the Duke of Milan, who even if previously restored to the throne by Charles V himself, voluntarily joined the alliance made to stop the Spanish hegemony over Italy.

The Pope managed to have the Emperor grant Sforza the ducal title on the throne of Milan again, but under the firm condition that, on Sforza's death, the Duchy would have returned definitely to the Empire. A marriage was also agreed between Sforza and Charles V's niece Christine of Denmark.

As suzerain of those fiefs, Charles V had it administrated by means of life-governors whom he himself appointed. The Emperor's decision strongly displeased François Ier of France, whose younger son Charles, in possession of the title of Duke of Orléans and thus with dynastical claims to the Milanese throne, had his candidature rejected, in spite of his assurances of allegiance to the Empire.
