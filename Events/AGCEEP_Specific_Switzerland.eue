	#-#The medieval Inquisition tried a large number of witches, but collective witch-hunting was exclusively a modern phenomena. Individual maleficium (Latin for witchcraft) was not uncommon in many rural areas, but it wasn't until scholastic demonology related witches and Sabbaths (night meetings with strong conspiracy elements, including cannibalism, orgies and a sacred oath of loyalty to Satan himself) that societies started to get obsessed with the matter. This conspiracy paranoia can track its roots as far as to the first massacres of Jews and Lepers in the High Middle Ages, when thousands were slaughtered by defeated Crusaders and angry countrymen. But it's in the early 15th century when demonological theories will become fully accepted by the upper classes. The Councils of Constance and Basel are considered to be the first public space in which these concepts, maleficium and Sabbath were publicly related. The work of Johannes Nider (1380-1438), The Formicarius (The Anthill), was a masterpiece of scholastic demonology and marked a new era in witch-hunting. The work of Heinrich Kramer (1430-1505), Malleus Maleficarum (Hammer of the Wicked) was the first work that reaches widespread attention, and works as a inquisitorial manual for witch-hunters. But it's not the Church that tries the most in Modern Ages. On the contrary, civil courts are responsible for 85-90 percent of executions. \n \nSwitzerland is home to the first witch-hunting process and an estimate of 5,000-10,000 burned witches makes it one of the most affected regions in Europe. Only by the early 18th century, with Illustration at the doors of Geneva, will the horrible massacre stop producing victims on the western side of the Alps.

Louis XII remained in Milan only a couple of months, then he made return to France and left Trivulzio there as his viceroy. But Trivulzio's way to administrate provoked deep Milanese resentments as much as to long for a Sforza's return and in January 1500, hearing that Sforza was assemblying troops to conquer Milan, an Anti-French revolt broke out in the city, the french troops were forced to abandon Milan except the garrison in Castello Sforzesco. In facts, with the gold he brought with, il Moro could hire mercenary troops and by February 1500 he made his entrance in Milan. After Milan, Sforza retook all the cities in the duchy and beyond Ticino River, where in Novara he had to face a French counterattack led by La Trémouille, also hiring Swiss mercenaries. The Swiss troops hired by il Moro, probably lured by the French gold and incited by their fellow-countrymen in the opposite camp refused to fight. 'The Duke's forces were composed of different races: German 'landsknechte', Burgundians who were commanded by the same Claude de Vauldray who had fought with the Good Knight in his first tournament, and Swiss mercenaries. There were bands of Swiss fighting on the side of the French, and those within the city declared that they would not fight against their fellow-countrymen in the other camp. They laid down their arms, and neither threat nor promise availed. Soon it was discovered that one of the gates of Novara had been opened by treachery, and that the French were entering the city. Then, as a last hope, Ludovico and his companions put on the dress of common soldiers and mixed with them in the ranks. But the unfortunate Duke was betrayed by one of the Swiss captains, who was put to death later by his own countrymen as a traitor.'(Bayard: The Good Knight Without Fear And Without Reproach, e-book by Christopher Hare) Ludovico Sforza was recognised and captured, then sent as prisoner to France where he miserably died, some years later, in the Castle of Loches, in Turenne. On 15 April 1500 The French troops made their second entrance in Milan.

In September 1505, a first contingent of 150 soldiers started their march towards Rome, they entered for the first time the Vatican in the evening of the 22nd of January 1506, where they were blessed by Pope Julius II. The prelate Johann Burchard of Strasbourg, Master of Pontifical Ceremonies at that time, and author of a famous chronicle, noted that event in his diary. Their first, and most significant, hostile engagement was on May 6, 1527 when 147 Guards, including their commander, died fighting the lansquenets lead by Charles de Bourbon, Constable of France, in the Sack of Rome.

Conditions were hard for Venice, the Republic had to renounce her traditional power to appoint bishops as well as all jurisdiction over Papal subjects in Venetian territory and was to compensate Pope Julius II for his war expenses needed to recapture the Papal holdings in Romagna, while the Pope accepted the humble request of the Republic for pardon, cancelling the interdict. But the reconciliation between Venice and the Pope did not stop the French to continue the war against Venice with attacks to her cities in Terraferma. Julius II, in the meanwhile, had become increasingly concerned by the growing French presence in Italy and formulated plans, both to chase the French out of the Po Valley and to seize the Duchy of Ferrara, a French ally, with the intention to add the territories of Modena, Reggio and Ferrara to the Papal States. In realizing his plan the Pope immediately excommunicated Alfonso d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, declaring his fief forfeited for his remaining loyal to France, then he gained the military support of Venice, eager to recover her territories lost to the French a armies and hired an army of Swiss mercenaries to attack Milan as to isolate the French armies in Italy. However his plans failed as the French army managed to invade Romagna and occupy the cities of Bologna and Ravenna, supported by the powerful and celebrated artillery of Duke Alfonso d'Este. In addition, in response to Pope's switching sides, Louis XII of France convoked a Schismatic Council at Pisa as to have the 'Warrior Pope' deposed. Pope Julius II, having unsuccessfully pressed the Republic of Florence to refuse hosting the schismatic cardinals, proclaimed the Holy League against France and convoked a Council of his own to meet at the Lateran in Rome. The promise of territorial gains at French expense caused Ferdinand II of Aragon and Emperor Maximilian I to abandon their alliance with the French, and in October 1511, they joined the newly-formed Holy League together with Julius II and the Republic of Venice. In November, Henry VIII of England and the Swiss confederation joined as well.

Thence the decision to withdraw from Milan. Julius II recovered Ravenna, Bologna and the rest of the Romagna, while his commander, the Duke of Urbino, easily occupied Reggio and Modena, though Alfonso d'Este refused any settlement that would deprive him of Ferrara. After having chased out the French from Italy, the congress of allies which met at Mantua in August made over to the Pope Parma and Piacenza, to which he had at best a shadowy claim. The Emperor and Fernando would have been glad to give Milan to their grandson Charles but the Swiss were in possession and, supported by the Pope, made their will good. The duchy was given to Ercole Massimiliano Sforza, the elder son of Ludovico. The Venetian claims were left unsettled with Brescia still held out and the Swiss claiming Cremona and the Ghiara d'Adda for the duchy. And more, the Emperor demanded Vicenza and Verona. Florence, who in 1509 had ended her long war by the recovery of Pisa, was punished for her support of France by the restoration of the Medici. Entering Milan, Ercole Massimiliano Sforza received the keys to the city from the Swiss soldiers, who promised to protect the duchy of Milan and to help the Duke in sending to him all the troops he would need. The Duke granted them the acquisition of the ducal territories Ticino and Valtellina, the most important accesses to the Alpine passes. Genoa drew back its allegiance to the French King, who in 1506 harshly repressed a local rebellion that broke out owing to the decision taken by the French governor to grant privileges to the nobilty. But Julius II made also a treaty with his late ally, Maximilian, against Venice. The emperor was to support the Lateran council to oppose that one proclaimed by Louis XII in Pisa and to hand over Modena to the Pope, while Julius II was to join in compelling Venice to give up the fiefs which the Emperor claimed since Cambrai and to use on behalf of his new ally also the always convincing 'spiritual weapons'. When this treaty was made public, it had only the effect to drive Venice to side with France.

He went to Geneva, but the population expelled him. He returned in 1541 and settled there until his death, working in the Consistory. Calvin, unlike Luther, was a one-book-man. His three editions of the monumental Institutio Christianae Religionis are a masterpiece of theological Protestantism, and one of the most important books of the century, highly influential for Dutch, Scottish and English reformed Protestants. Calvin also planned a severe reform of customs and ancient practices, and in his war with local nobility, he prosecuted and expelled many of his opponents. Geneva was to be a model city, a city ''fearful of God'', tidy, clean, and with no vagabonds or idle people. Consequences for both Geneva and Switzerland were extremely important, because a ferocious moral regime was started to supervise any practices that looked dangerous to both Church and Government. Also, many foreigners were attracted by the opportunity to freely practice Protestant Eucharist and Baptism (the basis of Lutheran and reformed rituals), therefore adding more than 5,000 inhabitants to city as Geneva, Bern and Zurich.

	#-#The medieval Inquisition tried a large number of witches, but collective witch-hunting was exclusively a modern phenomena. Individual maleficium (Latin for witchcraft) was not uncommon in many rural areas, but it wasn't until scholastic demonology related witches and Sabbaths (night meetings with strong conspiracy elements, including cannibalism, orgies and a sacred oath of loyalty to Satan himself) that societies started to get obsessed with the matter. This conspiracy paranoia can track its roots as far as to the first massacres of Jews and Lepers in the High Middle Ages, when thousands were slaughtered by defeated Crusaders and angry countrymen. But it's in the early 15th century when demonological theories will become fully accepted by the upper classes. The Councils of Constance and Basel are considered to be the first public space in which these concepts, maleficium and Sabbath were publicly related. The work of Johannes Nider (1380-1438), The Formicarius (The Anthill), was a masterpiece of scholastic demonology and marked a new era in witch-hunting. The work of Heinrich Kramer (1430-1505), Malleus Maleficarum (Hammer of the Wicked) was the first work that reaches widespread attention, and works as a inquisitorial manual for witch-hunters. But it's not the Church that tries the most in Modern Ages. On the contrary, civil courts are responsible for 85-90 percent of executions. \n \nSwitzerland is home to the first witch-hunting process and an estimate of 5,000-10,000 burned witches makes it one of the most affected regions in Europe. Only by the early 18th century, with Illustration at the doors of Geneva, will the horrible massacre stop producing victims on the western side of the Alps.
