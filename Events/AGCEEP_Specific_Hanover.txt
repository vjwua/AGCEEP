Against resistance within the family Duke Ernst August of Hanover introduced a new law of succession to the eldest son that should prevent further divisions. Yet he was outlived by Georg Wilhelm and the inheritance of Luneburg was to be achieved by his son Georg Ludwig in 1705. However the Emperor acknowledged the reestablished power of the Welfen in Northern Germany and offered to make them Electors on December 9th 1692. Yet the opposition of the older line of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel and the Elector of Saxony had to be dealt with. The Saxons could be convinced, but the Brunswickers managed to gain French support against Hanover.

	#-#Gotthold Ephraim Lessing was one of the most influential figures of the Enlightenment in Germany and can be considered the father of the modern German theater and literary criticism. Born in Upper Lusatia in 1729, he came in contact with literature and philosophy at the university of Meissen. After working quite unsuccessfully as a playwright and literary critic in Leipzig, Berlin, Breslau and Hamburg, he finally got an office as librarian in Wolfenbüttel, paid by his patron, the Elector of Hanover. He was strongly influenced by classic poetry and dramaturgy and, especially, by Shakespeare and wanted German theater to follow these ideals instead of the French classical theater. While he tried to contribute to the establishment of a German national theater in Hamburg between 1766-1769 (which eventually failed), he wrote down his ideas of a drama true to the spirit of Aristotelian dramatic unities and devoted to spread the ideas of the Enlightenment in the Hamburgische Dramaturgie. According to him, the audience should be made to identify with the actors through pity and fear, and, witnessing the catastrophic outcome, be freed from unnatural desires and emotions. He opposed simple, unrealistic black-and-white characters and introduced more ambivalent personalities in his plays. Most of them were set in a middle-class environment and advocate the ideals of the burghers, thus following Lessing's idea of the Bürgerliches Trauerspiel. His most famous plays are Miss Sara Sampson (1755), Minna von Barnhelm (1763), Emilia Galotti (1772) and Nathan der Weise (1779), the last being the most prominent one due to its controversial plea for tolerance and religous freedom. Lessing was also important as a merciless and aggressive literary critic, the first who in a brillant way honestly expressed his opinion of contemporary literature.
