	#-#Haydar 'Alî came from a family of cavalry officers in the Mysore army. While serving as a commandant, Haydar 'Alî had many occasions to learn about European methods of fighting and was deeply impressed. As early as 1755-56, he is said to have obtained the services of Frenchmen to organize his artillery, arsenal and workshop. Haydar 'Alî's rise to power was the result of not only his personal diplomatic skills, but largely on the armed power he acquired. His brilliant combination of European styled musket-using infantry and mobile calvary organized on the Mughal pattern proved invincible. Undoubtedly, he was the first important Indian commander to realize the value of European methods for drilling infantry, whom he tried to provide with flintlocks. Intervening in a struggle between the raja and his powerful minister, Haydar 'Alî styled himself the power behind the throne. After receiving the title of Haydar 'Alî Khan from the Mughal Viceroy of the Deccan, Haydar 'Alî found pretence to claim himself superior to the Raja of Mysore and took over control of the state. Shortly thereafter, he would go on to expand towards the Malabar coast.

His troops were trained and financed by the French, who were eager to halt British advances on the subcontinent. In doing so, Tîpû Sâhib also stuck to his father's plans of modernization.
