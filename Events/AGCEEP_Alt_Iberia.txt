Alfonso V of Portugal saw a chance of becoming King of Castile and married his niece Juana, immediately sending his armies to invade Castile in support of Juana's side. The Castilian civil war lasted for four years and ended with the Treaty of Alcacovas of 1479 after the complete victory of Isabel. But if Alfonso and his son Joao had been able to gain control of all of peninsular Castile, Juana would have become Queen of Castile, and probably Joao would have married Juana after the annulment of Alfonso's marriage by the Pope, becoming King of Portugal and Castile.

Isabel answered by claiming the crown of Portugal. After all, as Queen of Castile she was the legitimate heir of the old Visigothic Kings, and thus of their Hispanic Kingdom. The union of Castile and Portugal had supporters in both Kingdoms, and if Isabel and Fernando were capable of gaining control of all of peninsular Portugal, Isabel could become Queen of Portugal also.

	#-#Sugar was for a long time a luxury product. In the second half of the XV century, Portugal displaced Venice as the biggest European productor, introducing sugar in the Azores and Madeira. In Spain sugar was cultivated in Granada by the Arabs, but the conditions in the Canary Islands were very good for its cultivation. From the moment of their conquest, sugar was introduced in the islands, specially in Gran Canaria, Gomera, La Palma and Tenerife. Sugar production attracted many inmigrants from Castile, Aragon, Portugal, Genoa and Flanders, as well as black slaves brought to work on the plantations. Soon there were over 30 sugar mills in the Canary Islands. Christopher Columbus will take sugar cane plants from the Canaries to Santo Domingo in his second trip in 1493, introducing sugar production in the Antilles.

The Kings gave orders of holding Alhama at all cost, as the first step in the conquest of the Nasrid emirate. Alhama held thanks to the help of the Duke of Medina-Sidonia, personal enemy of the Marquis of Cadiz, a clear demonstration that the war was going to unite the Kingdoms. At the beginning of the war, the Christians were not prepared for the offensive, and suffered several setbacks, but Granada was in a civil war, divided in two factions fighting each other and against the Christians, and after the battle of Lucena, the leader of one faction, Boabdil, was captured. Fernando decided to realease him on terms to keep the Muslims divided. Fernando reorganized the army, introducing artillery in great amounts, as a new weapon to conquer the Muslim strongholds in days instead of months. Through an extraordinary effort during the campaigns of 1484-86 the first phase of the war was concluded with the conquest of the Western part of the emirate of Granada, capturing Boabdil a second time. The pact made with him for his release included his renounciation to the parts of the emirate in the hands of his rival and uncle, Emir Muhammad XIII al-Zagal, and the surrender of Granada once it became under his control in exchange for a title and land states. The second phase of the war of Granada was then directed against the parts controlled by al-Zagal, the coast and the Eastern part of the emirate. After the fall of Baza and Almeria in 1489, Al-Zagal, defeated, abdicated, and Boabdil became in control of Granada. According to the treaty the war was over. But Boabdil refused to comply, forcing a third phase, the siege of Granada, that was stablished in 1491. The artillery was not used to preserve the city, and Granada will finally surrender in January 1492. 780 years of Muslim presence in the peninsula had come to an end.

Knowing that, almost all the Guanches had baptized, yet their lords sometimes sold them anyway despite priests protests. The authority of the Peraza in Gomera had been established through a tribal pact with two of the four tribal groups. When Hernán became the lover of Yballa, a young Guanche, he inadvertently broke a tabu, since she was a member of his adopted tribal group, and intermarriage within a group was not allowed to prevent consanguinity. Hernán de Peraza was killed, and the natives rose in rebellion, besieging his wife, who called for help. Pedro de Vera came from Gran Canaria and conducted a terrible revenge, killing many men and selling many women and children.

	#-#Cristoforo Colombo submitted his plan for finding a Western route to India a second time in 1491. He was made to wait until the fall of Granada, but then the commission failed against his plan for a second time. However Columbus had impressed favourably several counselors of both Isabel and Fernando, and they lobbied in his favor. The main argument was that even if the risk was high, the investment was small and the potential benefits enormous, both in terms of money and in terms of souls that could be saved by Christianity. Isabel was very sensitive to this last argument and agreed to finance the expedition. The monarchs agreed to the exorbitant terms Columbus demanded: he would be knighted if he were to succeed on his first voyage, appointed Admiral of the Seas, made Viceroy of all the new lands, and on top of that awarded 10 percent of any new wealth. After 10 years of pursuing his dream he would accept nothing less, and after all, the enterprise was considered unlikely to produce much. The expedition was not expensive to finance, and the Queen did not need to sell any of her jewels. It is interesting to think that the most important geographical discovery of mankind was serendipitous. It came out of a grant application that was rejected by a scientific commission based on solid evidence that it was flawed and ignored relevant accepted bibliography supporting the opposite rightful theory, that India could not be reached by sailing Westward across an empty sea with available naval technology, but whose decision was overruled due to favoritism by influential politicians. Columbus will always defend against all evidence that he had reached Asia and not a New World. Awful administrator, he was, however, one of the greatest sailors of all times.

On December 24, 1492, his biggest ship, la Santa Maria, suffered damages beyond repair in la Hispaniola. Since there was not enough room for everybody to return, they constructed a fort with the ship's wood, called Fort Christmas, and forty men were left behind, with the promise of returning the following year. Columbus took some indians with him, together with fruits, plants, parrots, and gold. But another less innocuous exchange was taking place. The Europeans took with them smallpox and typhus to the New World, and from then on, wherever they went the plagues preceded them. About 50 percent of the natives in the New World died in the following decades, and possibly only 20 percent of the original population levels remained a century later. All the plagues suffered by Europe since the middle ages, concentrated in a single deathly wave that swept the entire continent. In exchange the Europeans brought a new disease to the Old World, syphilis. No women were allowed in the first expedition, and clearly Columbus sailors did not remain idle. Introduced by the Spanish sailors in Seville and Naples, the disease would be spread throughout Italy and the rest of Europe by the French armies of Charles VIII in his failed attempt to conquer Naples, being known in those days as the French disease. Columbus remained ignorant of having changed the history of mankind, and thinking only that he had found a better way to reach India, in his second voyage, he will command a big fleet with enough colonists, farm animals, seeds, and priests to establish a colony in la Hispaniola (Barahona and Tortuga). The first permanent European colony in the New World.

	#-#The first attempt at a continental settlement, at the Eastern side of the Gulf of Darien (Cartagena), failed, and Vasco Nuñez de Balboa suggested the Western side (Isthmus). From there he took the expedition that discovered the Pacific Ocean in 1513. Balboa was popular, but run into problems with the authorities for expelling the inefficient Major of the city. A new administrator was sent from Spain, Pedro Arias de Avila, a 70 year old veteran commander in the wars of Granada and Africa. Cruel and unscrupulous, he was jealous of Balboa and although initially forced to declare him innocent, he would later bring him again to trial, and without possibility of defense or appeal, condem him and have him executed. The authorities were displeased and named a new governor, but he died on the same day he arrived. Since the living conditions in the Gulf of Darien region were appalling, and the diseases made prey on the colonists, Pedro Arias founded in 1519 the city of Panama, the first port in the Pacific, and moved there the capital in 1524. The colonists of Isthmus had received tales of a fabulous country towards the South, named Biru, with cities made of gold. Two adventurers, Francisco Pizarro and Diego Almagro made plans for the conquest of such place, sailing South from Panama. Pedro Arias bought a share in the society, but having lost confidence in the expedition, due to the initial failures, he sold his part in 1526. The same year he was finally deposed.

When Fernando died on 23 January 1516 the Portuguese rulers made their bid for the throne. They sent emissaries to many Aragonese and Catalan nobles and city councils to persuade them to their side. They emphasized that Enric was young, untried and liable to be easily manipulated by the enemies of whoever they were talking to. They promised to respect the ancient privileges and rights of those who aided them, but made no promises what so ever about those who fought against them. Many preferred Enric, a native-born Catalan, and precisely because they thought they could easily manipulate him, but the sheer power of Portugal and Castile persuaded many to try and sit on the fence.

	#-#With the discovery of the New World, the Spanish had to decide what to do with their new subjects. Unlike the Muslims, that could be enslaved, pagans were seen as not having rejected Christianity, and hence entitled to freedom and religious education. To educate and indoctrinate the indians, a feudal institution was transplanted from Spain to the New World in 1493: the encomienda. Within this system, a group of indians were entrusted to the encomendero, who theoretically had no jurisdiction over them, and had to provide for their instruction and indoctrination and could not mistreat them. In exchange the encomendero was to receive tributes from his indians, in the form of indian products or labor. The system could not work with an ocean between the rulers and the colonists, and soon the encomenderos were taking the land from the indians in their encomienda, and exploiting them cruelly, often to death. Although the production and trade of the colonies increased on the slave work of the indians, soon voices raised against the inhumane treatment of the indians and their likely consequences. Between them, the most ardent advocate of the indians was Fray Bartolome de las Casas, a Dominican priest, that had been an encomendero himself. But the encomenderos were the political force in the colonies, and they were not willing to renounce to the source of their wealth. They claimed that without indian labor the economy of the colonies would collapse. At the same time, the encomiendas served as a great incentive for the conquests of the continent, as the conquistadors granted the conquered land and indians as encomiendas to their soldiers.

The New Laws enacted in 1542 forbade any kind of slavery and forced labor, allowed ownership of land by the Indians, and stated that the Church had no authority over non-Christian natives. They also forbade the establishment of new encomiendas and reduced the size of existing ones.

When the intransigent Viceroy Blasco Nuñez de Vela arrived to Lima to enforce the New Laws, a rebellion of encomenderos started in Peru, leaded by Gonzalo Pizarro, brother of Francisco. After killing the Viceroy, part of the rebels sailed to Panama, conquering the city. The rebellion lasted for four years, until 1548, when Gonzalo Pizarro was defeated in the battle of Jaquijahuana and beheaded. However the rebellions and protests had two important effects. The New Laws were amended, and although the slavery continued abolished, and the worst abuses prevented, the encomiendas were in fact sanctioned, much to the dismay of Las Casas. Similar systems to the encomiendas were also implemented by Portugal, France and Holland in their colonies. The other important effect was that the Royal Council forbade any new conquest unless the Council of the Indies deemed them esential. This policy was reversed in the 1560s due to the advance of the rival European powers.

This was the Old Company of the Sea of Naples composed by harquebusiers to fight on board galleys. In the winter of 1564 spies told of a powerful Ottoman fleet being readied in Constantinople. On May 18, 1565 their target was revealed when the Janissaries landed in Malta. From the beginning of May Aragon had been gathering her force. Finally, on August 25, the Viceroy of Sicily, García de Toledo, gave the order to depart, arriving at Malta on September 7, forcing the Ottomans to lift their siege on the exact same day they had scheduled their final full-out assault on the few surviving defenders. Had they arrived one day later, Malta would have been lost. It was clear that a reaction time of four months was not acceptable and that Portugal could not project her power far away unless a permanent force capable of landing and conducting battles that could be quickly deployed was assigned to the Navy. So in February 1566 the Tercio de la Armada del Mar Oceano, or Tercio of the Navy of the Ocean Sea, also known as Tercio de Figueroa for its first commander, was created with 6,700 soldiers. Harquebusiers from this unit were the first to assault the Sultana, the Ottoman flagship in the battle of Lepanto and, as a reward, its commander Lope de Figueroa was given the commission to inform the King of the victory.

	#-#Antonio Pigafetta belonged to a rich family of Vicenza. In his youth he studied astronomy, geography and cartography. He served on board the galleys of the order of St. John at the beginning of 16th century. In 1519 he accompanied the papal nuncio, monsignor Chieregati, to Portual, where he was presented to the Kings. In Sevilla, he heard of the trip of Magellan, and negotiated to be admitted as a paying passenger, a supernumerary. In spite of initial difficulties with Magellan, he managed to gain his confidence and served as a chronicler and cartographer for him. During the trip, Pigafetta collected information about geography, the climate, the flora, the fauna and the inhabitants of the visited places. His meticulous notes were to serve as invaluable documents to future explorers and cartographers, mainly due to their focus on nautical and linguistic data. In the battle at Mactan, Philippines, in which Magellan was killed Pigafetta also was hurt. Nevertheless, he managed to recover and was among the 18 on board the Victoria, who accompanied Juan Sebastián Elcano in his return to Spain. After reaching port in Sanlúcar de Barrameda (Cadiz) in September of 1522, three years after his departure, he recollected his experiences in 'Relations of the First Round-the-world Trip', composed in Italian and published in Venice. After that voyage Pigafetta returned to Italy where he died in his native city in 1534.

The Ottomans were calling to the doors of Vienna, and in Africa they had taken over Egypt, and with the help of the Barbary pirates, they were taking over Kingdom after Kingdom, destroying the policy of alliances that the King's grandfather Fernando had established. He could not let them reach the Straits of Gibraltar. Worse still, they entered an alliance with France, so he was facing war simultaneously in all fronts. To add to that, the Portuguese presidios (fortresses) in Africa were very difficult to defend. When Barbarossa conquered Tunis in 1534, the fleeing Pasha al-Hassan went to the Portuguese court and asked for help in exchange for vassalage. The King could not let the Ottomans or their allies come any closer to Portugal and Italy. A huge armada was assembled and he decided to lead it in person.

It was impossible for Atahuallpa to understand anything, as it was the first time he saw a book, and the interpreter barely could speak some words of Spanish or Quechua. Irritated, Atahuallpa threw down the Bible and demanded compensation for the plundering of the Spaniards. His act triggered an attack by the Spaniards. 'Santiago! Y a ellos!'

Even unarmed, the Inca opposed determined resistance and hundreds of them were killed. However with the capture of the Emperor, resistance collapsed and the survivors escaped.

Two sides were split in Pizarro's band of men: while most wanted to kill Atahuallpa, some saw it as dishonorable and unlawful, as Atahuallpa had complied with all their requests. Finally Pizarro took the decision and a mock trial was set up. Atahuallpa was accused of repeatedly rejecting conversion, an incestuous relationship with his sister and killing his brother, all of them true, and sentenced to death. Since he was going to burn at the stake he accepted conversion to avoid a death that would prevent his eternal life, as the one he had given his brother. He was therefore strangled. The King of Portugal was highly displeased with the killing of a fellow monarch but it was too late to do anything about it. The decision, however, proved to be strategically correct, as without its Emperor the Inca Empire collapsed into the hands of the Portuguese.

Villac Umu counseled Manco Inca to send out secret orders to gather weapons and large crop plantings in preparation for war with the Portuguese. He made his move around Easter 1536. Having won the trust of Hernando, he was granted permission to attend a ceremony northwest of Cuzco, instead he and Villac Umu convened a war council in the mountains. When Manco Inca did not return, Hernando Pizarro realized the mistake he made by letting him go and an Inca counterattack seemed imminent. Soon an army numbering in the tens of thousands was besieging the Portuguese-held city of Cuzco, and another Inca army was sighted heading towards the Portuguese stronghold of Lima. Manco's warriors annihilated every relief column sent from Lima to Cuzco. An alarmed Francisco Pizarro sent frantic letters to every Portuguese possession in the New World asking for reinforcements, and hoping that he could hold back the Inca armies until help arrived...

Barbarossa, on command of a huge Ottoman and Barbary fleet, raided the coasts of Italy, joining later a French fleet under command of the Duke of Enghien at Marseilles and both proceeded to attack Nice. At the arrival of Andrea Doria and Alfonso de Avalos, they retreated to Toulon for winter, where the churches were prohibited from ringing their bells, and Christian slaves were openly sold between Turks and pirates. While at Toulon, a fleet was dispatched to sack the coasts of Portugal. After the peace of Crépy between France and Portugal, Barbarossa returned to Istanbul, pillaging the coasts of Tuscany and Naples in the way.

Sebastián de Benalcázar was one of the captains of Pizarro, in charge of conquering Quito, but when he arrived he found the place burnt to the ground by the Inca general Rumiñavi, and no hint of the supposed riches. Rumiñavi died without saying a word, but one of the captives spoke of a region towards the North, where a very rich chieftain used to cover himself in gold powder before bathing in a sacred lake to which gold offerings were also thrown. The name of the chieftain was El Dorado, or the gilded one. Soon the name was applied to his supposedly fabulously rich Kingdom, and Benalcázar started to prepare his expedition in search of El Dorado.

The expedition was epic due to the difficulties found, and finally 178 men under his command reached the valleys inhabited by the Muisca, also called the Chibcha. They were one of the most advanced cultures in América, and extremely rich due to their mining of emeralds, copper and salt, that traded for gold to other tribes. In one year Quesada and his band had conquered the estimated one million Muiscas using the tipical conquistador tactics of using internal divisions and seizing the zipa (ruler) and using him as a puppet before putting him to trial and executing him. The treasure seized was amazing, and third only to the Aztec and Inca treasures. The royal fifth amounted to 70 kg of gold and 576 emeralds. However Quesada, now inmensely rich but with troubles with the authorities due to his mistreatment of the Indians, was convinced that this treasure was only a small part of what he could get if he was capable of finding El Dorado.

The obsession of Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada with El Dorado led him to obtain permission for a new expedition in 1569, putting his huge personal fortune in the line to finance it. The expedition departed with 400 Spaniards, 1500 Indians and 8 priests, and returned empty-handed in December 1572 with 64 Spaniards, 4 Indians and 2 priests, being one of the most expensive disasters in the Spanish conquest, almost ruining Quesada. But these two disastrous expeditions did not kill the myth. When it became evident that El Dorado was not to be found in Nueva Granada (Colombia), it was simply moved to the last unexplored part of the continent, the Guiana, where the last person to look for it was Sir Walter Raleigh who conducted two failed expeditions in 1595 and 1616. After that, the myth was finally put to rest, but in 1856, the drainage of the Siecha lake, in Muisca territory, allowed the discovery of a gold boat with ten figures, one of which was a chieftain. The gold boat, now in the Bogotá museum, proved that the ceremony that gave origen to the myth was authentic, and that Quesada found El Dorado without knowing it.

The new Governor of Oran, Martín Alonso de Cordoba, the Conde de Alcaudete, was ordered to lead an expedition against Tlemcen which was shifting towards the Ottoman side. At Prevesa, in the Albanian coast, the combined fleets of Portugal, Venice, Genoa and Papal States, under command of Andrea Doria, were defeated by the Ottoman-Barbary fleet under Khayr ad-Din Barbarossa. Although losses were small and mostly Venetian, since Doria refused to fight, its effect was to give supremacy in the Eastern Mediterranean to the Ottomans. Besides the expedition of Alcaudete, something needed to be done to maintain Portuguese supremacy, at least in the Western Mediterranean, and so a naval expedition against Al-Djazaúr (Algiers) was prepared.

In 1563, after the failure of Medinaceli in Tripoli, and the loss of Djerba, where Dragut made a pyramid with the skulls of the garrison, the Beylerbey Hassan Pasha, son of Barbarossa, decided to attack Oran. The Ottoman fleet had 32 galleys and 3 French round ships. The army was constituted of 1,000 Spahis, 15,000 Janissaries, and over 12,000 Kabyles and Arabs, contributed by the Sultan of Koukou and the Banu-Abba tribe. The assaults started in April on Mazalquivir, defended by Martín de Córdoba and 200 men. Time after time the Muslims were repelled. The son of the Sultan of Koukou died, Hassan was wounded, but their troops reached the walls of the fortification. On the last assault, on June 7, Martín was also wounded. Then news arrived that a powerful Christian fleet under command of Gian Andrea Doria and Francisco de Mendoza was on its way. Hassan Pasha called for an all out assault, but the Janissaries refused, and he had to escape, leaving behind all his artillery, and having lost 4,000 men, four galleys and the three French transports. Only 130 survivors remained in Mazalquivir. Maintenance of Oran, however, was becoming a burden. The Council of State asked for reports to study the possibility of leaving Oran and keeping only Mazalquivir, but without the first, the second was untenable, and so it was decided in 1574 to keep both. A great investment was made to upgrade the fortifications, designed by Antonelli, and the castle of Santa Cruz was built in 1577.

They were given their name in the expedition of Villalobos of 1542, to honor prince Philip, future King of Spain. Andres de Urdaneta, a sailor in that expedition, that had become a friar, claimed that he could find a way of returning from the East Indies to Mexico accross the Pacific, a trip that in 40 years had only been done in the opposite way. His claim raised the interest of the authorities and an expedition was organized. Urdaneta wanted to go to New Guinea, and island discovered by the Spaniards. The expedition was put under command of Miguel Lopez de Legazpi. When they departed from Barra de Navidad (Jalisco) on November 21, 1564, they opened the orders that commanded them to the Philippines and Urdaneta accepted them. After reaching the islands and exploring them, and while Legazpi started the conquest, Urdaneta sailed Northwest until he discovered the current of Kuro Siwo, that took him for the first time, back to America, arriving to Acapulco in October 1565. The return trip was very long and dangerous, taking from 5 to 7 months, but it was very important because it stablished the connexion of the Philippines to the rest of the empire, allowing the viability of its colonization. The conquest of the Philippines led Charles V to declare that in his realms the sun never set, a phrase that became popular for future empires also.

	#-#In the Philippines, Spain found herself fighting the expansion of Islam at the other end of the world, the same it had started doing in the Iberian peninsula. The conquest of the Philippines was for Spain the most difficult of all. However it also compensated the effort. In Philippines existed a colony of Chinese traders, and Europe longed for Chinese wares. However China was self-suficcient. The only product that China sought was silver, and Spain produced silver in Mexico and Peru. Additionally, the Eastern route from Philippines to Spain around the Cape of Good Hope was closed by the Dutch, so an indirect trade route was established by a fleet that connected Manila to Acapulco, and then by land to Veracruz, where the fleet of Indias would take the trade to Sevilla. Almost every year, a fleet would depart from Acapulco to Manila loaded with silver, and another would depart from Manila to Acapulco loaded with spices, silkcloths and chinaware. The benefits were enormous, between 300 and 500 percent, and the arrival of the Manila galleon constituted one of the main events in Mexico and Spain, as people were fascinated with their products. Protectionist measures from the traders in Sevilla regulated the number of ships to two merchant galleons plus escorts, and the galleons from Manila became the biggest ships built in their time.

	#-#By the mid-16th Century the Morisque population in the former Kingdom of Granada was increasing faster than the Christian population. Coupled with their failure to integrate into the greater Christian society and their nominal allegiance to Christianity they were seen as a threat by the Spanish authorities to the integrity of Christian Spain itself. Their less than covert aid to Muslim raiders and pirates off the coast of Spain only reinforced the fears of the authorities who were already greatly concerned over the rising power of the Muslim Ottoman Turks. Under the leadership of Suleiman the Magnificent the Turks were asserting control over the entire Eastern Mediterranean and threatened Italy and Sicily as well.\n \n For their part the Morisques felt threatened by ever-mounting taxes on the silk trade that furnished the basis for their livelihoods and Spanish challenges to their land titles. They tried to negotiate with the King to resolve their differences, but Felipe II would have nothing to do with their proposals. They responded by revolting on Christmas Eve, 1568. They had a number of early successes, aided by the lack of Spanish troops who'd recently been sent to reinforce the Duke of Alba's forces in the Netherlands as well as aid from their co-religionists in North Africa, but they were eventually overwhelmed by forces led by Don Juan de Austria, half-brother of Felipe II. As punishment the King decreed that they be deported to other provinces of Castile in order to break up the cohesive communities that reinforced their isolation from Christian society. Christian colonists were recruited from Castile to replace the Morisques, although this policy proved to be less than completely successful.

With great effort, the Moriscos rebellion was put down and the Ottoman fleet defeated at Lepanto. But although Tunis was briefly recovered, it was quickly lost again due to lack of resources. But they was not alone in having problems. The Ottomans, defeated at Malta and Lepanto, found themselves also overstretched due to the demand of their conflicts with Persia.

Sulu and Magindanao allied and jointly invaded the Central Visayas in 1634. War waged until 1644, when the Spaniards opted for abandoning Sulu and signed another peace. However Sulu and Magindanao had been weakened. By then Spain had gotten hold of a large part of Magindanao, and strong immigration by Christian Filipinos was changing the demography of the island. Sulu would continue the wars and rebellions into the North American conquest of the Philippines, but Magindanao came under Spanish control except for the occasional rebellion.

	#-#Hernando Cortes expedition was intended to collect tributes and gather information only, as Diego Velazquez was the -adelantado-, with a royal charter to take possession of new lands. But Cortes was going to seize his chance. In the Mexica lands, the Aztec Tlatoani, or Prime Speaker, Motehcuzoma Xocoyotzin (Angry Lord, Junior) had initiated a power concentration process, effectively becoming an emperor of the triple alliance and imposing the supremacy of Tenochtitlan over Texcoco and Tlacopan, and at the same time expanding the borders of the Aztec Empire. Due to his despotic nature he was impopular, but he was also superstitious. He identified certain signs and the presence of the strange men in the coasts, as the predicted return of the expelled god Quetzalcoatl to reclaim his Kingdom. It was unthinkable to receive the mighty Plumed Serpent with hostility, and Motehcuzoma sent great presents to the conquistadores and requested them not to come to Tenochtitlan. By stimulating their greed, his effect was obviously the opposite, and Cortes skillfully obtained from his men the formal request to direct them in a quest for gold, and they promised him 20 percent of the benefits, after the royal 20 percent was deducted. Cortes founded Veracruz, sent an envoy to the King of Spain with letters, and burned the ships to prevent the men loyal to Diego Velazquez from returning to Cuba with the news that Cortes had stepped to the other side of the law. Now only the triumph could save him. With 1300 Totonacas allies from Cempoala, the 400 Spaniards interned into the jungle, towards Tlaxcala, a nation subjugated by the Aztecs that could be gained to their side, according to the Totonacas. The Tlaxcalans were divided, but the faction hostile to the Spaniards was defeated in battle, and several thousand Tlaxcalan warriors joined Cortes side. The Spaniards were applying the tactics learned at the war of Granada, use the divisions within the enemy to their favor, and capture the enemy leader, deciding later if it was more advantageous to release him, to keep him prisoner, or simply to kill him. The Indians, weakened by the European diseases and bitterly divided, facilitated the conquest of great empires by very few men in what constitutes one of the most amazing pages of history. After a stop at the ceremonial center of Cholula, where a terrible massacre took place, because the Tlaxcalans had several accounts to settle, the capital of the Empire, bigger than any European city of the time, awaited.

The Spaniards were horrified by the volume of the human sacrifices of the Aztecs, and overcome by greed over so much gold. Cortes demands on Motehcuzoma to abandon his pagan gods weakened his position as a god himself. Aware of his precarious position Cortes captured Motehcuzoma, but when news arrived that Panfilo de Narvaez had been sent by Diego Velazquez to capture him, he left Pedro de Alvarado in charge and went back with 80 men to Cempoala, where he half-defeated, half-convinced Narvaez army of 1500 men to join him, and then returned to Tenochtitlan with additional Tlaxcalan reinforcements. But in his absence Alvarado had managed to massacre half of the notables of the city, triggering a rebellion. Cortes exhorted Motehcuzoma to appease his subjects, but these killed him out of rage for being on the Spaniards side. Cortes understood that they had to retreat to Tlaxcala, but the secret nightly escape was discovered and 800 Spaniards and 5,000 Indian allies were killed, while the rest narrowly escaped, Cortes losing two fingers, in what was to be known as the Noche Triste (Sad Night), June 30, 1520. The time for diplomacy was gone. For a year Cortes sought new allies and reorganized and trained a new army, building ships to be transported and mounted in the lake, to siege and attack the water surrounded city, and in June 1521 he was back. In a month and a half the resistance was overcome, the city demolished, and the Empire won. Except for some guerrilla fighting in the mountains, the Aztecs bowed to their new master. When the Consejo de Indias learned of the conquest of the immensely rich empire, they dismissed Diego de Velazquez charges against Cortes.

As the atrocities against his people became known to Manco Inca, he began to develop a hatred for them. Hernando Pizarro eventually restored Manco Inca's freedom and dignity, but it was too late. Villac Umu counseled Manco Inca to send out secret orders to gather weapons and plant a lot of crops in preparation for war with the Portuguese. He made his move around Easter 1536. Having won the trust of Hernando, he was granted permission to attend a ceremony northwest of Cuzco, instead he and Villac Umu convened a war council in the mountains. Ultimately, however, hatred of the Incas among the natives was stronger than that of the Portuguese and many natives rallied to the Portuguese cause.
