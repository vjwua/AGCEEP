Said to have had the gift of miracles (karâma), he travelled around the countryside and attracted as many as 13,000 disciples to his movement, for whom he founded zâwiyas all over Morocco. The governor of Âsfî expelled him from the town because his movement was a threat to the Marînids.

The growing Ottoman influence in the area reached Morocco, but the Sa'did Muhammad al-Shaykh, known as al-Mahdi, dethroned the pro-Turkish Wattasid sultan Ahmad. The days of the Wattasids were over in Morocco. He then sent his son Muhammad al-Harran with 30,000 men to take over Tlemcen. But the Turks defeated them and al-Harran died of illness. Then the Ottoman beylerbey of Al-Djazaîr (Algiers), Salah Ra'is, conquered Fez in 1554, installing Ali Abu Hassan supported by Janissaries, but Muhammad al-Shaykh reconquered Fez the same year and formed an alliance with Spain. The death of Salah Ra'is when fighting Spain, allowed Muhammad al-Shaykh to retake Tlemcen. However the Ottomans sent spies that assassinated the resisting Muhammad al-Shaykh in 1557, ending the bid of Morocco to take over Tlemcen, that was absorbed into the Ottoman Empire.
