In its early days this University was modeled on the universities of Paris, Cologne and Vienna. In a short time it grew into one of the largest and most renowned universities in Europe. Its academic fame attracted scientists who have made valuable contributions to European culture. Let us enumerate a few renowned names: In the 16th century the humanist, Desiderius Erasmus, lectured here. He founded the Collegium Trilingue in 1517 for the study of Hebrew, Latin and Greek - the first of its kind. The tutor of the young emperor Charles V, Adriaan Cardinal Florensz of Utrecht, was a professor here before being elected in 1522 as the last non-Italian Pope before Pope John Paul II. The philologist, legal scholar and historian, Justus Lipsius, taught here for years.

Philip, the third and in some ways most successful of the four Valois dukes of Burgundy, was well known for arranging magnificent and spectacular events, but this one was destined to top them all. Rather conveniently, Philip had a vow written out which he passed to the herald to read out, after which he repeated his vow to take up the cross, as long as the King of France or his regent went as well, or to go alone as long as his own lands were secure and peaceful. He then went on to swear to seek out the Ottoman leader and defeat him in single combat. In what appears to have been a carefully organised rush of enthusiasm, his son Charles, Count of Charolais, immediately made similar oaths, as did the Duke of Cleves. Alas the crusade to free Constantinople never happened. Philip announced sweeping reforms to his finances, explicitly stated as being to raise money for the crusade, and seriously cut back on domestic expenses and pensions. He completely reformed his revenue raising mechanisms, and made them far more efficient.

France was at odds with the Pope, Burgundy delayed their help, Milan was trying to seize Genoa, and Florence cynically advised the Pope to let the Turks and the Venetians wear each other out. But the Venetians and the Hungarians signed their support in 1463. Thousands of destitute men from all of Europe came to the Pope's call and he led them to Ancona in the summer of 1464, where he became very ill. Meanwhile Philip The Good dispatched a fleet commanded by his two bastard sons, who on the way to Italy liberated Portuguese Ceuta from Berber besiegers.

A steady stream of dissenters flowed to a group of nobles who would form a League against Louis. Charles, Count of Charolais and son of Philippe, Duke of Burgundy, had captured several of the Somme territories along with several towns and estates ceded to Jean, Count of Etampes and Nevers, by the Duke of Burgundy. Royal troops led by Louis met the Burgundian army at Montlhery. The resulting battle left Burgundians masters of the field. Louis had escaped to Paris where he would soon be under seige. The Burgundian and Breton troops, united, forced Louis to agree to the rebels' demands. Thus, Burgundy regained the Somme towns and Charles Count of Charolais received the territories ceded to Jean Count of Etampes and Nevers. Louis XI would not be compensated for the Somme towns, and, by the terms of the Treaty, Louis was not entitled to repurchase the territory until after Charles' death.

Most of the local nobility operated as robber barons, there was virtually no tax collection and the Swiss neighbours in the south occasionally sent pillaging troops in and tried to expand into these territories. One such border war with Helvetia in 1468 was concluded by Sigismund promising to pay 10000 Guldens. Since he was always in financial trouble, he soon searched for someone to grant him a credit. After the Emperor's and the French King's refusal, the only likely creditor was Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy. When on March 21st 1469 the two princes met in Arras, they negotiated an even more far-reaching agreement: Sigismund saw Burgundy as a potentially useful ally against the Helvetian threat, and in order to tie him closely to Tyrol, he offered him to mortgage the Vorlande for an amount of 50000 Guldens. To rebuy the provinces, Tyrol would have had to pay back not only this sum, but also all expenses Burgundy would make for the establishment of an administration, which seemed practically impossible for the struggling Count. Hence by the treaty of St. Omer signed in May Sigismund sold the Vorlande to Burgundy in exchange for the money he badly needed and Burgundian support against his Helvetian enemies. Only due to Charles' premature death in battle the vorlande were returned to Tyrol.

When her father died in 1477 at the age of 43, Mary was only nineteen and Louis XI of France seized the opportunity provided with his rival's death to take possession of the duchy of Burgundy and also of Franche-Comté, Picardie and Artois. He justified his military intervention with the fact that these lands had always been fiefs to the French crown and that with Charles' death, the last member of the French Valois dynasty they had 'de facto', according to the salic law, reverted to France. But the choice of which prince should marry the duchess would be of particular importance for the future political and economical stability of Western Europe, so he urged Mary to accept his son, the Dauphin Charles, as husband, in order to secure the inheritance of the Low Countries for his descendants too, even by force of arms if necessary. Mary, however, distrusted Louis and declined any French support and offer of marriage but, in order to be recognized as legitimate ruler over the Low Countries and to get financial and military help of Flemish cities against the French aggression, she made so great concessions as to reduce the Burgundian states effectively to a sort of federation of provinces. Satisfied that the country was sufficiently weakened and disorganized, Louis XI ordered his army into Artois and Hainault, but the imminence of danger seemed to revive in the Burgundian provinces a spirit of loyalty towards the Valois heiress and arrangements were made for the marriage of Mary with Maximilian of Habsburg, Archduke of Austria and son of the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick III. The alliance with the Empire was intended to save the inheritance of the young princess from the French hands. However it would result in thereafter making Low Countries direct dominions of the House of Habsburg. The marriage between Mary and Maximilian was hastily celebrated at Ghent on 18 August 1477.

In order to be set free he made a treaty with the people of Flanders in which it was stated that he was recognized as regent of the Low Countries except for Flanders, which was to be governed by his son Philip under guardianship of a council. Moreover, a congress of all the provinces was to be summoned annually, to provide for the general welfare. The treaty was signed on 16 May 1488 under Maximilian's promise to dismiss all foreign troops within a few days. Giving hostages for his fidelity, he was set at liberty but in the meanwhile, his father, Emperor Frederick III sent an army under the Duke of Saxony in the Low Countries to free his son.

But the French aggression forced Archduchess Mary to make a decision about the choice of an husband capable to save the Burgundian dominions from the eager hands of Louis XI of France. She refused Louis XI' offer to marry the Dauphin and cancelled the promise of marriage previously made to Maximilian of Habsburg, as both solutions would mean the end of independence from France or the Empire. However arrangements for a marriage were to be hastened and for sure other suitors wouldn't miss the opportunity to get the Burgundian throne. Amongst Mary's suitors, 'Philipp der Edelmütige', a German noble member of the Palatine branch of the House of Wittesbach and Imperial Kurfürst (Elector Palatine) and 'Johann II Duke of Cleves-Mark', another German prince. Both of them would provide substantial diplomatic, military and other ressources nearby in order to support a free and still independent Burgundy against any French aggression. By marrying a local noble such as 'Filips van Kleef' (Philip of Cleves) Lord of Ravenstein (German born but Flemish grown up member of a noble and powerful family with blood relations to the Valois dynasty) Burgundy would wholly benefit from the allegiance of the Flemish cities. However she will be on her own.

The Treaty arose primarily as a means with which to secure the Low Countries from Louis's claims, and thus preserve the stability and status of Duke Philippe's lowland inheritance. The Treaty formally rendered to Louis provinces in his realm that he had claimed at the outset of the war, and also recognized and reaffirmed Flandern as fief of France. In order to solidify a lasting peace, the Treaty pledged Mary's daughter, Margaret, to Louis's son and heir, Charles. Thus, Louis's acquisitions were, in light of the treaty, dowry for Margaret's marriage. Maximilian, of course, would have to agree to the marriage.

In 1512 when the French troops were routed from Italy by the Swiss mercenaries in their retaking of Milan, Mercurino managed to stipulate an agreement with Louis XII, King of France, with which the county of Burgundy was to be considered as Burgundian imperial fief and 'neutralized territory' during war times. The treaty, whose terms were guaranteed by the Swiss, was reconfirmed by the new French King François Ier in 1522, thus avoiding Franche-Comté from being ravaged during the Italian Wars.
