	#-#The Czech priest and professor Jan Hus developed radical reformatory demands on the base of the teachings of John Wyclif. Despite a guarantee of safe-conduct by Emperor Sigismund, he was executed at the stake for heresy at the Council of Constance in 1415. This could however not stop the Hussite movement in Bohemia. Hus' followers were rapidly growing, and when King Vaclav IV of Bohemia died and his brother Sigismund, already Emperor and King of Hungary was to succeed him, they, unwilling to forgive him the betrayal of Hus and afraid that he would suppress them, refused to acknowledge him and gained control of most of Bohemia proper - while the lands of the Bohemian crown and the catholic part of Bohemia accepted Sigismund. Due to its radical anti-clerical and anti-feudal tendencies Hussitism posed a big threat to the church and nobility in the countries adjacent to Bohemia. Several German and European princes therefore decided to oppose the Hussites and to support Sigismund in his struggle with them that lasted for almost two decades. Should we decide to fight these heretics, we should be aware that this would be internationally regarded as an intervention in favour of Sigismund as rightful King of Bohemia rather than a war of conquest, and that therefore, if Sigismund prevails and manages to restore royal authority, we would be expected to turn over any conquests in Bohemia to the Kingdom of Bohemia.

First in Brandenburg, then in Lauenburg and finally 1423 in electoral Saxony the branches got extinct, and the remaining members of the family lacked unity and determination to secure the territories. Instead, the Hohenzollern and Wettins were given the old Askanian lands and took their former rank. The last step in this process was the extinction of the electoral branch in Saxony-Wittenberg with the heirless death of Albrecht III. This caused a tough contest between the Hohenzoller Elector Friedrich of Brandenburg and the Wettin Margrave Friedrich IV of Meissen for Albrecht's possessions. Eventually, Emperor Sigismund decided in favour of the Wettin and granted the Electorate and Saxony-Wittenberg to him. Henceforth, the electoral title remained within the Wettin family that managed to become one of the predominant forces in the Empire while the Askanians left in Anhalt were virtually powerless.

Since Friedrich refused Kaufungen took him to an imperial arbitrarian court. However, the court decided in favour of the elector which caused Kaufungen to leave it angrily and to swear that he would take revenge on Friedrich's own offspring. It was no empty promise: In the night between July 7th and 8th 1455 he kidnapped the Saxonian princes Ernst and Albrecht from the castle of Altenburg with the intention to take them to Bohemia. This could only be prevented by the coincidental help of two charburners who arrested Kaufungen and saved the princes.

But his son Philip died unexpectedly early in 1506, leaving two male heirs, Charles and Ferdinand which were respectively born in 1500 and 1503. Maximilian decided to support Charles, who in 1516 was already Archduke of Burgundy, King of Spain, Sicily and Naples, in his investiture as King of the Romans and future Holy Roman Emperor. But this diplomatic move would have been very expensive. Most of the German princes were already supporting the French candidate, King FranÁois Ier. Maximilian seemed to successfully convoy the favour of the imperial electors towards the Habsburg cause, by means of granting investitures and making promises of large sums of money with the help of bankers such as the Fuggers and the Welsers. The Pope, who couldn't accept the presence of an Emperor with territorial claims in Italy as it was under the rule of Emperor Frederick II, would have supported a German prince like Friedrich III of Saxony, with no particular interest laying beyond the Alps. Looking for international credit, also Henry VIII King of England took part in the imperial election offering his candidature but withdrew soon after the first consultations.

However, with British and Dutch naval assistance, Charles XII landed on Zealand and promptly defeated the Danes, then moved to Estland where his badly outnumbered Swedes (1 to 5) won a crushing victory over the Russians. Instead of finishing the Russians, Charles moved against August II of Poland-Saxony and drove him out of Poland in 1704 (having the pro-Swedish Stanislaw Leszczynski elected King), then subjugating Saxony in 1706. While the Russians started the construction of St-Petersburg (1703) and rebuilt their armies, they also took parts of Estland (1704-1706). Charles then decided to march to Moscow via the Ukraine where the Cossacks under Mazeppa had again risen in revolt (1708). The harsh winter and Russian raids decimated his army and he was finally beaten at the battle of Poltava in 1709. The wounded King escaped to the Ottomans. The Russians were encircled by the Ottomans on the Prut River, but Peter succeeded through bribery to obtain a safe conduct in exchange for Azov. While Charles was still exiled in Turkey, Russian, Danish, Hanoverian and even Prussian troops captured most of the Swedish territory around the Baltic. Having emerged from Turkish internment, Charles got killed in 1718 in front of the Norwegian fortress of Frederickshald. The peace treaties that followed Sweden lost most of her Baltic empire.

The peace that followed the conflict, provoked by the foreign opposition to the Pragmatic Sanction stated by the former Emperor Charles VI and ended with the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, resulted in a well defined rivalry between major European powers forming essentially two main political formations: the alliance of the socalled 'Bourbon family pact' (France, Spain, Naples and the latest Parma, all with members of the same House of Bourbons) with Prussia and the alliance between Austria, Russia and England. Disappointed by England's interested approaches to the emerging power of Prussia wich led to the Convention of Westminster, a treaty with which both countries would avoid any foreign military presence or access in the German territories, Austria strengthened her political ties with Saxony, Russia and Sweden and started new diplomatic handlings with France, traditionally an arch-enemy of the Habsburgs since the old dispute over the Burgundian inheritance but for sure the most powerful antagonist to the rising British colonial empire. And an alliance with France would also mean the support of Spain and the Bourbon Italian monarchies. That diplomatic move would lead to a huge world conflict fought in the years between 1756 and 1763: the socalled 'Seven Years War'.
