Suddenly, the 7th of November, King Christian summoned the nobles to the Great Hall, where he proceeded to accuse them of heresy and conspiracy against the True Church. The reason cited for this was the removal of Trolle, and Trolle himself demanded, that he be repaid for the destruction of his castle and his removal. Sten Sture's widow, Kristian Gyllenstierna, however, made the fatal mistake of showing King Christian the list of the names of the people who had signed the document of Trolles removal. Christian took the opportunity, and declared all the involved (except Hans Brask, the Bishop of Skara) to be heretics and enemies of the Church, a few days later the executions began, it is estimated that between 60 and 90 noblemen were executed, and many more burghers and regular Stockholmers.

Consequently religious persecutions began in Bohemia to eradicate Protestantism from that land. To penalize Friedrich V of the Palatinate and to reward Maximilian of Bavaria, Ferdinand deprived Friedrich of his electorate and of the Upper Palatinate and granted both to Bavaria. That was an obvious violation of imperial law, but since no German prince was really in a position to defy Ferdinand and Maximilian, it was done and Maximilian had achieved a recognition proportionate to his power. An attempt to help the Lutheran rulers of neighboring Lower Saxony made by King Christian IV of Denmark who, himself a Lutheran and, as Duke of Holstein, an Imperial nobleman, feared that Denmark's sovereignty as a Protestant nation was being threatened. The Danish army had to face the fiercer imperial troops formed by mercenaries under the command of Albrecht von Wallenstein, who was given by Emperor Ferdinand II free hand in pillaging all the territories his army would have crossed or captured from the enemy.

Despite his weak position when elected King in 1648, Frederik III's political skill allowed him to succeed in ousting two of his main adversaries in the Rigsråd as early as the 1650s. The two were the seneschal Corfitz Ulfeldt and the governor of Norway Hannibal Sehested, who were both married to Frederik's half-sisters. The King's heroic conduct during the siege of Copenhagen in the winter of 1659 had, in addition, made him widely popular at a time when the nobility and the Rigsråd were increasingly being discredited. In October 1660, these events led the estates - the nobility only reluctantly - to create a hereditary monarchy. The new system meant that the King was no longer dependent on the Rigsråd, and he immediately used his new power to introduce absolutism, which was temporarily established on 10 January 1661 in the Hereditary Monarchy Act before being fully set out in Kongeloven (the King's Law) of 1665, the basic law of Danish absolutism.

However, with British and Dutch naval assistance, Charles XII landed on Zealand and promptly defeated the Danes, then moved to Estland where his badly outnumbered Swedes (1 to 5) won a crushing victory over the Russians. Instead of finishing the Russians, Charles moved against August II of Poland-Saxony and drove him out of Poland in 1704 (having the pro-Swedish Stanislas Leszinski elected King), then subjugating Saxony in 1706. While the Russians started the construction of St-Petersburg (1703) and rebuilt their armies, they also took parts of Estland (1704-1706). Charles then decided to march to Moscow via the Ukraine where the Cossacks under Mazeppa had again risen in revolt (1708). The harsh winter and Russian raids decimated his army and he was finally beaten at the battle of Poltava in 1709. The wounded King escaped to the Ottomans. The Russians were encircled by the Ottomans on the Prut River, but Peter succeeded through bribery to obtain a safe conduct in exchange for Azov. While Charles was still exiled in Turkey, Russian, Danish, Hanoverian and even Prussian troops captured most of the Swedish territory around the Baltic. Having emerged from Turkish internment, Charles got killed in 1718 in front of the Norwegian fortress of Frederickshald. The peace treaties that followed Sweden lost most of her Baltic empire.

In June 1771 he had the King name him privy Cabinet minister, and in July he was made a count.

	#-#Denmark was and is primarily an agricultural nation, and it was one of the first to adopt the new farming methods and tools that were invented in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Fields were reallotted, improved ploughs were used, crop rotation was introduced and new high-yield crops (potato, Indian corn) from the new world were taken into wide use. Not all of the reforms were greeted with joy by the peasants, but the most unpopular by far involved the splitting of villages into separate farms so that the peasants could live closer to their fields.

	#-#Recalled to office in April 1784, Bernstorff, until his death, served as foreign minister in a moderate liberal government. He supported a series of reform measures including the regulation of landlord-peasant relations and the emancipation of the serfs. In foreign affairs, Bernstorff carefully pursued a policy of neutrality. When the French Revolution broke out, he condemned any interference in the domestic affairs of France and avoided every anti-French coalition. In March 1794 he negotiated a neutrality treaty with Sweden for protecting the merchant shipping of both countries by combined squadrons. Bernstorff's foreign policy won him the respect of European diplomats - his domestic policy gained him such popularity among the Danes that his death (June 21, 1797) was regarded as a national calamity.

Thanks to the strong leadership of Reventlow, a compassionate humanitarian, the original commission was expanded in 1786 and, through gradual improvements and temporary setbacks, eventually led to the complete abolishment of serfdom ('stavnsbåndet') in Denmark in 1800.
