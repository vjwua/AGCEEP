Lithuanian and south russian nobles were very upset as these muscovite nobles were their former sworn enemies. Soon, the eastern provinces were in revolt and asked the King of Poland for protection, who gladly accepted. The tsar, preparing his expansion into tatar lands and not wishing to be distracted by a civil war and a war on Poland, decided to do nothing about their treason.

The Muscovites, however, led by the clergy, implored him to continue to rule, and in 1565 he acceded to their request on condition that he should be allowed to deal with the traitors as he wished and that he should form an Oprichnina-i.e., an aggregate of territory that would be administered separately from the rest of the state and put under his immediate control as crown land. The term Oprichnina also refers to the reign of terror which was conducted by the oprichniki, members of the tsar's new court, who were primarily drawn from the lower gentry and foreign population. The terror culminated with the proscription of the entire population of Novgorod and the sack of that northern city, which opposed Muscovite dominance (1570). The policy reduced the boyars' political power, disrupted the Russian economy, and contributed to the centralization of the Muscovite state. After 1572, when the oprichniki were disbanded, the term dvor (court) replaced Oprichnina.

By 1658, Nikon had aroused sufficiently powerful opposition to bring about his banishment, and in 1666 he was deposed and degraded.

In both towns Razin and his men engaged in drunken orgies and perpetrated savage atrocities against the nobles and military officers - he also replaced the local governments with Cossack institutions of self-rule. Razin continued his advance up the Volga, and along the way he incited the serfs and urban lower classes to join his rebellion. He captured Saratov and proceeded to Simbirsk, while his insurrection spread throughout the Volga region and even into some of the central Russian provinces. Alarmed at Razin's success, Czar Alexis sent an army to relieve Simbirsk. The force inflicted a decisive defeat on Razin's undisciplined and badly equipped troops. Razin fled to the Don, but on April 24, 1671, he was captured by loyalist Cossacks and turned over to the tsarist authorities. Brought to Moscow and tortured, Razin was executed by quartering in Red Square.

	#-#In 1697, the 15 years old Charles XII ascended the Swedish throne. Seeing the opportunity, the Russian Czar Peter I allied with Denmark and Poland-Saxony in 1699. However, with British and Dutch naval assistance, Charles XII landed on Zealand and promptly defeated the Danes, then moved to Estland where his badly outnumbered Swedes (1 to 5) won a crushing victory over the Russians. Instead of finishing the Russians, Charles moved against August II of Poland-Saxony and drove him out of Poland in 1704 (having the pro-Swedish Stanislas Leszinski elected King), then subjugating Saxony in 1706. While the Russians started the construction of St-Petersburg (1703) and rebuilt their armies, they also took parts of Estland (1704-1706). Charles then decided to march to Moscow via the Ukraine where the Cossacks under Mazeppa had again risen in revolt (1708). The harsh winter and Russian raids decimated his army and he was finally beaten at the battle of Poltava in 1709. The wounded King escaped to the Ottomans. The Russians were encircled by the Ottomans on the Prut River, but Peter succeeded through bribery to obtain a safe conduct in exchange for Azov. While Charles was still exiled in Turkey, Russian, Danish, Hanoverian and even Prussian troops captured most of the Swedish territory around the Baltic. Having emerged from Turkish internment, Charles got killed in 1718 in front of the Norwegian fortress of Frederickshald. The peace treaties that followed Sweden lost most of her Baltic empire.

While he drew his officers from the nobility, he conscripted peasants and townspeople into the other ranks. The troops were equipped with flintlock firearms and bayonets of Russian make, uniforms were provided, and regular drilling was introduced. For the artillery, obsolete cannons were replaced with new mortars and guns designed by Russian specialists or even by Peter himself (he drew up projects of his own for multi-cannon warships, fortresses, and ordnance). The Army Regulations of 1716 were particularly important - they required officers to teach their men how to act in battle, and to show initiative in the face of the enemy. For the navy, Peter's reign saw the construction, within a few years, of 52 battleships and hundreds of galleys and other craft - thus a powerful Baltic fleet was brought into being. Several special schools prepared their pupils for military or naval service and finally enabled Peter to dispense with foreign experts.

At the same time, he founded the Admiralty shipyard on the riverbank opposite the Peter-Paul Fortress - in 1706 its first warship was launched. Around the fortress and shipyard Peter began the building of a new city to serve as his 'window on Europe'. In 1712 the capital of Russia was transferred there from Moscow, although it was still formally on Swedish land. But only under the despotic rule of Czarina Ekaterina II the Great, the most Europeanlike city of St. Petersburg would be imposed as the new capital of the Russian Empire with the construction of the Winter Palace, the Czarina's winter imperial residence. Moscow would remain the Russian capital of orthodoxy and traditions.

The war did not last long enough to embrace all of Europe and Maurice fled to France where he then had a brilliant military career.

He had joined the Russian Academy of Sciences two years after it had been opened by Catherine I the wife of Peter the Great. At the Academy Euler had many colleagues who would provide an exceptional environment for him: he carried out projects dealing with cartography, science education, magnetism, fire engines, machines, and ship building. The core of his research program was now set in place: number theory, infinitesimal analysis including its emerging branches, differential equations and the calculus of variations, and rational mechanics.

The peace that followed the conflict, provoked by the foreign opposition to the Pragmatic Sanction stated by the former Emperor Charles VI and ended with the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, resulted in a well defined rivalry between major European powers forming essentially two main political formations: the alliance of the socalled 'Bourbon family pact' (France, Spain, Naples and the latest Parma, all with members of the same House of Bourbons) with Prussia and the alliance between Austria, Russia and England. Disappointed by England's interested approaches to the emerging power of Prussia wich led to the Convention of Westminster, a treaty with which both countries would avoid any foreign military presence or access in the German territories, Austria strengthened her political ties with Saxony, Russia and Sweden and started new diplomatic handlings with France, traditionally an arch-enemy of the Habsburgs since the old dispute over the Burgundian inheritance but for sure the most powerful antagonist to the rising British colonial empire. And an alliance with France would also mean the support of Spain and the Bourbon Italian monarchies. That diplomatic move would lead to a huge world conflict fought in the years between 1756 and 1763: the socalled 'Seven Years War'.

When confronted with the realities of power, Catherine saw very quickly that emancipation of the serfs would never be tolerated by the owners, whom she depended upon for support, and who would throw the country into disorder once they lost their own means of support. (The fortune of a noble was evaluated not in lands but in the 'souls' he owned.) Catherine instead turned her attention to organizing and strengthening a system that she herself had condemned as inhuman. She imposed serfdom on the Ukrainians who had until then been free. By distributing the crown lands to her favorites and ministers, she worsened the lot of the peasants, who had enjoyed certain autonomy.

Those several alliances were set up to restore the Bourbons to the French Throne, crush the revolution and get Europe back to normal again. This succeeded in 1814 and again in 1815 when foreign armies brought Louis XVIII on the throne. Louis XVIII was the brother of the Executed King Louis of France and in early life was known as the Comte de Provence. He remained in Paris after the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789 but escaped to Belgium two years later. After King Louis' execution in 1793 he proclaimed himself regent, and after the death of his brother's heir in 1795, he took the title Louis XVIII. He lived as an exile in various European countries until he became King after Napoléon's first abdication in 1814. On Napoléon's return to power in 1815, however, Louis again fled to Belgium

These furs, along with customs duties levied on all Siberian raw materials acquired by Russian entrepreneurs, more than reimbursed the state for the costs of its Siberian conquest and administration.\n \n With the decline of the fur trade in the early 18th century, mining became the chief economic activity in Siberia. The state was the chief entrepreneur, but wealthy private families were also involved and silver, lead, and copper mining began around 1700.
