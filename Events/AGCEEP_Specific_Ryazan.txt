	#-#In 1427, during the instability following the death of Vasily I and struggle between Yury and Vasily II, prince Ivan of Ryazan rightly saw the need to make an agreement of friendship and aid with Lithuania. Ivan promised to help and stand by Vytautas in all his actions, but remain loyal to Vasily II of Muscovy in all matters not involving both Vytautas and Vasily. Vytautas, in turn, promised to defend Ryazan against common enemies, and not to interfere in internal affairs of Ryazan. The agreement became pretty much useless after the death of Vytautas and an onset of a civil war in Lithuania.

	#-#Historically, in the 16th century the Roman Empire of Constantinople was long gone and its revival viewed as impossible. The Orthodox Faith never had a head figure like the Pope of the Catholic Faith. It however was mostly guided from Constantinople by the Patriarch there. As the Sunni Muslim Ottomans used the Patriarchs hostage-like situation for there own political gains many Orthodox countries felt appalled and started to loosen the chains of tradition. There had not existed a country as mighty as the Byzantines until...Russia was formed. Russia was created from the notion of full control of all those orthodox people that once had been Christianized from Kiev. This together with the fact that there was only one Orthodox country powerful enough to take up the mantle of the fallen Byzantines made the solution perfect and, thus the Greatest of Princedoms changed into the Empire of Russia.
