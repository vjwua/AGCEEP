	#-#When in 1570 the Turks sent an ultimatum to Venice asking for the ceding of Cyprus and then invaded the island after the Republic of San Marco failed to respond, a great uproar was created in the Catholic world by the facts and rumors of Ottoman atrocities in the last Christian bastion of the eastern Mediterranean. After a first failure in the summer of 1570, Pope Pius V managed to convince major Catholic nations (except France) to join a Holy League against the heathens Turks, and it was proclaimed in May 1571. The League would lead to the great naval victory of Don Juan on the Turks at Lepanto, but would not outlast this first and final triumph. Selim II is rumored to have said, after the news he had lost 200 galleys at Lepanto: At Lepanto, the Christians have shaved me. At Cyprus, I cut their arm. My beard will grow again….

Italy became more removed from the mainstream of European development and each local administration along the peninsula lagged behind that of any other European contemporary. The practice of agriculture as prevailing economic activity meant the coming back to power of the most conservative landowning aristocracy. That economic backwardness associated with the effects of Counterreform deeply affected Italian social life too, now less and less inclined to accept innovation and to develop some entrepreneurial attitude.
