Having defeated Safavid Persia, he turned to the Mamluk Empire. At that time, the Mamluk state already was in a state of anarchy and its armies hopelessly inferior to those of the Ottomans, and thus Selim's armies rushed through its defenses at an incredible speed. On August 24th the Syrian army led by the Sultan himself who got killed in that battle was destroyed near Aleppo, the city of Damaskus conquered on October 12th and the rest of Syria and Palestina quickly overrun. After wintering in Damaskus, Selim progressed to Egypt. On January 21st, the last remaining Mamluk army engaged for the final battle near Radania and was decisively defeated. This battle marked the end of the Mamluk Empire. Selim offered vassal status to the last Sultan Tumanbeg...

There he heard of a small Portuguese fleet anchored nearby at Chaul under the leadership of Lourenço de Almeida, son of the Portuguese Viceroy. Although many of the Portuguese galleys escaped Lourenço de Almeida was killed in the battle and his ship captured. In February 1509 Francisco de Almeida massed his ships and sailed to Diu to revenge his son. There he decisively defeated the Egyptian, Gujarati and Calicutian ships, dying the whole harbor crimson to quote one chronicler. This victory established the Portuguese as masters of the Indian Ocean until the arrival of the English and Dutch during the next century.
