As testament to their friendship and Junaid's temporal importance, Usun Hasan gave away his sister, Khadija Begum, in marriage. Likewise, Junaid's son, Haidar, would go on to marry a daughter of Usun Hasan. By the reign of Yaqub, Haidar's military and political strength had grown to such heights that Yaqub had begun to fear the power of his brother-in-law. In 1488, Haidar obtained the permission from the Shirvanshah to march through his territories to make war on the Circassians. However, Haidar turned to attack the capital of Shirvan to avenge the death of his father, Junaid, who was killed in 1460 at the behest of the Shirvanshah. The ruler of Shirvan wrote to Yaqub begging him for assistance. He warned that Haidar would not 'be satisfied with such a meagre empire' and that 'on the contrary, it will merely whet his appetite.'

Concerned about his nominal vassal's sudden territory gains, Yaqub summoned Haidar to meet him in Tabriz where he intended to public rebuke him for taking Shirvan. Warned of the Sultan's intentions, Haidar rallied his supporters and marched on the Sultan's caravan as it made it's way to the capital.

After disposing of Alwand's brother, Sultan Murad made camp in the northwestern frontier of Persian Iraq. With neither side attempting to force the issue, the dispute was eventually submitted to arbitration. A treaty was drawn up that divide the Ak Koyunlu empire at the Qizil Uzan river, between the two pretenders. Alwand accorded the environs of Azerbaijan, Diyarbakir and Arminiya, while Sultan Murad received the two Iraqs, Kerman, and Fars. With this decrease in power, the Ak Koyunlu was unable to check the strength of Dulkadir or the up and coming Ismail of Safavid origin.
