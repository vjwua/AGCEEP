Moreover, the Maniots prevented the Turks from building guard posts on their lands. Kladas was honored in Venice and acquired Venetian citizenship. During these tumultuous years, the entire Morea revolted against the Ottomans. The territories of Patra, Mystras, Corinth, Sparta, and Argos were liberated. After the end of the Turco-Venetian War, the Venetians left the Maniots to fend for themselves. Many of the Greeks who had revolted alongside the Venetians were massacred by the Ottomans, but many of them fled to find refuge in Mani. Korkodeilos Kladas never accepted the clauses of the agreement made between the Turks and the Venetians. He not only refused Turkish offers, but he also began to revolt against them. On the 9th October 1480, Kladas and his followers gathered an army and captured all the Turkish held castles in the Morea. The Ottoman government was enraged. An army sent by the Sultan was defeated between Passavas and Oitylo during February of 1481. Later that month a bigger force under Mohammed Bey drove Kladas to Porto Kagio. Kladas kept Mani as an autonomous region for 9 years and also went to Northern Epirus to fight. He was killed in battle near Monemvasia in 1490.

They desperately needed a base, preferably by reconquering Rhodes, otherwise an island in the Aegean, but nobody helped and Venice opposed them. Europe was at war and there was no place for their neutrality. The emperor Carlos however came up with a master idea. He offered Malta to the Hospitallers. Malta was difficult to defend from the growing Ottoman power, but the Knights were a tough breed. They would give their life defending his shipping lines with Sicily. In 1524 the Hospitallers sent a commission to Malta. Their report was very negative. The island could not sustain itself, and the defences were very poor. Then Carlos decided to include Tripoli in the deal as a take it all or leave it all. The Knights opinion on Tripoli was even worse. They did not have the resources to upgrade its defences. But having no other option, the Chapter General decided in 1527 to accept the offer with the opposition of the French Langues. They still had hopes of recovering Rhodes, but in 1530 they gave up and moved to Malta, taking possession also of Tripoli. From then on, the Spaniards and the Knights of St. John would fight their battles in North Africa together.

The main purposes of this alliance, stipulated in disguise of a trade agreement, was the planned combined attack to the Empire from two opposite fronts and the use of the Turkish galleys led by Kair-ed-din Barbarossa to engage the enemy's fleet and to raid the coastal villages of Italy and Spain. The alliance that had been under discussion since 1525 was preliminarily agreed in February 1535 and formalized in February 1536 between French ambassador Laforest and Grand Vizier Ibrahim. The treaty also granted the French commercial concessions in the Ottoman Empire replacing Venice, as well as conceded the so called capitulations which also allowed French consuls legal jurisdiction over French subjects in Ottoman domains and recognized the French King as protector of the Christian holy places in Palestine, concessions that would have long-term effects on Ottoman relations with other foreign powers as well as internal development. The pact was kept secret, though, because to the Christians, the impious alliance between the Most Christian King and the worst enemy of Christendom was a heinous act.

After the first revolt of the janissaries in 1449 they started to acquire power and prestige and some Muslims found the way for their sons to be admitted. After the great wars of Selim and Suleyman, Muslims started to be admitted openly to increase the size of the Janissary beyond what the devshirmeh could provide. This apparently innocuous measure changed the peculiar status of the Janissary breaking the balance of power in their favor.

The timariots were responsible for production and tax collection, and had to provide also soldiers for the sultan's army. This system proved to be a great source of income and an incentive for new conquests. But by 1550 the timar system entered a crisis. Lack of new conquests from the Christians and a population boom from 12 to 22 million, strained the resources increasing unemployment and dropping wages, while new taxes were imposed to support the huge military expenses. Timars became less productive, abandoned by the peasants, or converted into hereditary chiftliks (large private estates made out of Timar land). The loss of power by the impoverished Turkish nobility and their sipahi cavalry left the janissaries as the main force.

Realizing what was the problem he started to reform the Janissary. When he met strong opposition, he announced his pilgrimage to Mecca, with the secret intention of recruiting a new army in Egypt and Syria to break the Janissary. But he did not fool the janissaries and they revolted and strangled him. Osman was the first sultan to die at the hands of his janissaries, but would not be the last. In total four sultans were killed and four more lost their thrones due to the Janissary. The janissaries became more dangerous to their own country than to any other. Did Osman have a chance against the Janissary?

Governor of Damascus, he was called by the mother of the young sultan Mehmed IV as Grand Vizier on 15th September 1656. A fierce fighter of corruption, he enacted many successful reforms, balanced the budget and led the war against Venice. After his death in 1661, his son Fazil Ahmed 'the Virtuous' succeeded him and governed till 1676.

	#-#In 1780, under financial constrains after the Russian war over Crimea, the Ottoman government started to resort to currency debasement. The resulting inflation and the rebellions that it caused, together with more wars prompted more debasements until 1850 creating a massive hyperinflation of 1,200 to 1,500 percent leading to the replacement of the Akche by the Kurus, at a rate of 120 to one, and exacerbating every problem in the Ottoman Empire. Eventually even the British Pound was affected by this crisis that led to lack of foreign credit by the Ottoman government and temporary foreign financial control of the debt administration in 1881. This long economical crisis marks the lowest point of the Ottoman Empire, and coincides with a period of extreme difficulty characterized by Anatolian and Balkan uprisings, Greek and Serbian independentism and wars against Russia, Iran and Egypt. Given the evident decline, strong attempts at reformation were made in the XIX century, but they came too late for the Empire.

	#-#Ottoman repression in Serbia significantly increased in the beginning of 19th century when janissary leaders, the dahis, rebelled against the Sultan and seized the rule of the Belgrade Pashaluk. It culminated in January 1804, when dahis prepared executions of popular leaders, gentry, priests, former rebels and wealthy traders, called the Execution of the Dukes (Seca knezova in Serbian). Being notified of the ongoing executions, Karadjordje Petrovic (Black George) escaped execution by ambushing the assassins with his men and killing them all. \nAs the response to the executions, Serbs rallied in Oraac on 14 February 1804, and Karadjordje was chosen to be the leader of the uprising. The rebels managed to quickly incite revolt, firstly under the pretext of liberation from dahis, but after the Battle of Ivankovac in 1805 they started open combat to end the rule of the Ottoman Sultan. In March of the same year Karadjordje was officially appointed Military leader of Serbia, the self-proclaimed Vozd. \n \nIn 1813, the Ottoman Empire launched a big assault on Serbia taking land all up to the rivers Morava and the river Drina, and Karadjordje, along with other rebel leaders, fled to the Austrian Empire on 21 September 1813.

Accordingly, in April 1815 he instigated the Second Serbian Uprising becoming Serbia's absolute leader. \nAfter the death of Karadjordje Petrovic, Obrenovic became leader of Serbia. By 1817 the Turks defeated Milo's armies but not before he negotiated with Marashli-pasha. Milo's diplomacy achieved Serbia's autonomy under the Ottomans leaving him in power though recognizing the Ottoman state. \n \nAfter the Russo-Turkish War of 1828-29, Serbia finally became an internationally recognized principality under Turkish suzerainty and Russian protection.
