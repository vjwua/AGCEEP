Sigismund needed this meeting much more than Jagiello. His position in Bohemia was weak and Polish help for Hussites could only make it weaker. He was afraid that eventually Jagiello would accept the crown of Bohemia for himself or one of his relatives - the Czechs had made several offers. Fortunately, the Teutonic Order lost a war against Poland and Lithuania in 1422. He used it as a pretext for diplomatic bargains. Jagiello, as a neophite, was more concerned about a crusade being declared on Poland if it did nothing about the Hussites than about possible danger from the Order. So Jagiello gave up Hussites and Sigismund gave up Knights. Neither kept their promises - soon Sigismund went back to his anti-Polish politics and Jagiello still did not officially support the Hussites. The only real effect of the meeting was to diminish the chance of war.

Despite a guarantee of safe-conduct by Emperor Sigismund, he was executed at the stake for heresy at the Council of Constance in 1415. This could however not stop the Hussite movement in Bohemia. Hus' followers were rapidly growing, and when King Vaclav IV of Bohemia died and his brother Sigismund, already Emperor and King of Hungary was to succeed him, they, unwilling to forgive him the betrayal of Hus and afraid that he would suppress them, refused to acknowledge him and gained control of most of Bohemia proper - while the lands of the Bohemian crown and the catholic part of Bohemia accepted Sigismund. Due to its radical anti-clerical and anti-feudal tendencies Hussitism posed a big threat to the church and nobility in the countries adjacent to Bohemia. Several German and European princes therefore decided to oppose the Hussites and to support Sigismund in his struggle with them that lasted for almost two decades. Should we decide to fight these heretics, we should be aware that this would be internationally regarded as an intervention in favour of Sigismund as rightful King of Bohemia rather than a war of conquest, and that therefore, if Sigismund prevails and manages to restore royal authority, we would be expected to turn over any conquests in Bohemia to the Kingdom of Bohemia.

	#-#Jagiello, who was probably born in 1351, was an old man when his first son Wladyslaw was born in 1424. Moreover, Jagiello was elected to the throne of Poland - he was a hereditary ruler only in Lithuania - and his son had no legal right to the crown of the father. In 1425, the nobility and clergy of Poland guaranteed the rights of the child, but complications in Lithuania gave them a chance to strengthen their position. One of the main factors of Jagiello's agreement was that he believed that Lithuania could only be saved if it was in close alliance with Poland. New privileges, granted in 1430 and 1433, lowered land taxes paid by nobility to a token level and gave it them the famous 'neminem captivabimus' law - that no noble could be imprisoned without the verdict of a judiciary court.

Within one month he died, leaving two minor daughters and his pregnant wife Elizabeth. For the case of the unborn child being male, Albrecht declared that his son would be his successor in all his fiefs just before his death. Based on this will, Elizabeth attempted to get the Parliament to appoint her Queen Regent for her unborn baby. Still feeling menaced by the Ottomans, a majority of the Diet consisting mostly of the middle and lower nobility however did not want to trust the country's fortune upon a woman and an unborn child and, led by the Transylvanian noble Janos Hunyadi, desired an adult King with a decent powerbase instead. It was Hunyadi who proposed the most obvious choice, Wladyslaw III, King of the other big Christian Kingdom in East Europe, Poland. Initially with the consent of Elizabeth, deputies of the Diet approached the nineteen-year-old Wladyslaw in Krakow and offered him the Hungarian crown. Meanwhile, Elizabeth gave birth to a son, the male heir Albrecht and she had hoped for, and called him Ladislaus. Since then, she was determined to secure the throne for her child and thus withdrew her approval of the offer to the Polish King. But instructed by Hunyadi and other magnates, negotiations continued. When Wladyslaw eventually accepted the proferred throne on March 8th 1440 and everything seemed ready for his coronation and the union of the two Kingdoms, Elizabeth fled Hungary to Austria with her son and the stolen Holy crown of Hungary. She had Ladislaus crowned King in Székesfehérvár on May 1st, more than two months before Wladyslaw's coronation on July 17th. The scene was set for a civil war between the supporters of Elizabeth and Ladislaus, called 'Loyalists' who were strongest in Western Hungary and Slovakia and championed by Ulrich of Cilli on the one side and the supporters of Wladyslaw, the 'Nationalists', based largely in the East and Transylvania and led by Janos Hunyadi, on the other.

Frycz called for equity of every citizen regardless of social class, wealth, religion or nationality and a division between the Church and the State. Frycz also proposed reform of penal and civil law, secularization of education and ban of feudal privilages. Frycz's work was soon put by the church on list of prohibited books.

Most of his ideas were not realized before the French Revolution.

	#-#During the liberal reign of Zygmunt August a group of Polish politicians and writers, including Jan Kochanowski and Mikolaj Rej founded a 'Republic' in a village of Babin, near Lublin. Even name of this 'entity' was a sneer since 'Babin' literally means 'Women's'. This 'Republic' was a parody of Poland with its diet (Sejm), offices and institutional church. It's 'citizens' were spending time on mocking parliamentary speeches, political discussions and famous persons. In many times they were simply mocking themselves. 'Republic of Babin' lacked only King. When Zygmunt August pointed out this oversight, Babin's 'government' responded that they do not need any other beyond him. The 'Republic of Babin' survived decades and many generations of politicians took active part of it. Even today it is a beautiful example of freedoms and right of expression which existed in ancient Poland.

However there was some Lithuanian opposition before 1st July...Mikolaj the Black, the head of the mighty Radziwill family had long dreamed to of detaching the Grand Duchy from the domination and recreate a Lithuania with him as King. The first steps were taken in the 1540's when Mikolaj approached the Habsburg Emperor who was very interested in seeing a weakened Poland on her borders. This lead to Mikolaj receiving the title Prince of the Holy Roman Empire in 1547. In April 1569 Mikolaj had bribed and prodded his fellow magnates into following his plan. The lower Lithuanian Szlachta was considered immature and voted as their magnates did. So on 1st July the meeting took place in Lublin, but the Lithuanian Szlachta unanimously detested any attempt to create a Union. At the same time Mikolaj let himself be crowned King of Lithuania in Vilna and announced that if Poland did not accept that Lithuania went her own way then Lithuania would realize a Military Alliance with the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire.

	#-#Religious tolerance in Poland had had a long tradition and had been de facto policy in the reign of the recently deceased King Zygmunt II. Following the childless death of the last King of the Jagiellon dynasty, Polish and Lithuanian nobles (szlachta) gathered at Warsaw to prevent any separatists from acting and to maintain the existing legal order. For that it was necessary to make all citizens unconditionally abide by any decision taken by a body, and the confederation was an important proof that two states stand together. On 28th of January 1573 the nobles signed a document in which representatives of all the major religions pledged each other mutual support and tolerance. The confederation created a legal basis for a new political system and at the same time secured the unity of the state which had been inhabited for generations by communities from different ethnic backgrounds (Poles, Lithuanians, Ruthenian, Germans and Jews) and of different denominations (Catholic, Protestant, Orthodox, Jewish and even Moslem). This act is remarkable in that it was not imposed by a government or by consequences of war, but rather resulted from the good will of members of Polish-Lithuanian society. It was also influenced by the 1572 French St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre, which prompted the Polish-Lithuanian nobility to see that no monarch would ever be able to carry out such an act in Poland. The articles of the Warsaw Confederation were later incorporated into the Henrician Articles, and thus became constitutional provisions alongside the Pacta conventa also instituted in 1573.

For example, Sendivogius assumed that air is not a single substance, and by heating saltpeter he isolated oxygen, which he called the Elixir of Life. Sendivogius's fame reached Emperor Rudolf II, who invited him to Prague and imprisoned him, believing that Sendivogius actually possessed the legendary philosopher's stone. This led to a major diplomatic crisis between Poland and Austria. The alchemist was eventually released on demand of the Polish King Zygmunt III.

Her interests lay in the Ukraine and the Wild lands where the Magnates could rule armies of serfs on the vast agricultural production plants. This was the first disagreement between King Zygmunt III and the Nobility. Another one was the matter of the religious freedom. The King never stopped working for making the Catholic Faith the foremost religion in the country. However he was quite unsuccessful. The last disagreement was the about Royal power. Zygmunt was the grandson of the strong Swedish King Gustavus Wasa and he worked for absolutism. Zygmunt fought an uneven fight, but his struggle irritated the Poles so much that his reputation is tarnished to this very day.

However, one of the prerequisites was that Wladyslaw converted to the Orthodox Faith something that was completely unthinkable for his father, the Jesuit-King.

Then he traveled to the Western Europe where he met some of Europe's famous commanders, including Spinola. After ascending onto Polish throne, Vladislav conducted many far-reaching military reforms. He reequipped artillery and infantry, increasing their firepower and Westernizing their drill and logistics. His new Polish army soon proved it effectiveness. It completely defeated the Russians in an excellent campaign during the Smolensk War (1633-4), made the Turks abandon their invasion plans (1634) and forced the Swedes to sign new, favorable truce (1635).

Hevelius spent four years observing the Moon and created detailed maps of the lunar surface. He also discovered the Moon's libration in magnitude. Careful observations allowed Hevelius to discover many stars and seven new constellations. Among the latter is the Shield of Sobieski - Scutum Sobiescanum, known as Scutum, the only constellation named after a historical figure. Hevelius was also interested in comets and discovered four new comets in the years 1652, 1661, 1672 and 1677. His discoveries led him to assume that these objects circulate the Sun in parabolic tracks. Johannes Hevelius died in 1687. Among his students was a young Englishman named Edmund Halley.

It was his initiatives to build one of contemporary Europe's biggest observatories in Ujazdow castle (near Warsaw) and to construct an extremely complex hydraulic scale. He also proposed to replace all the countless European systems of length measures by one integral metric system. In February 1648 De Nuaire, secretary of Queen Ludwika Maria of Poland, wrote to the famous Parisian astronomer Marino Marsene that in Warsaw Buratini demonstrated 'a model of 4 or 5 foots in length, which with the help of flex placed under the tail, could rise to the air: the flex was moving a spring and a wheel placed inside. This model could rise a cat sitting in it.' Later De Nuaire wrote that the Italian constructed 'a flying ship', which could transport a man. Soon Europe was full of rumours that at the Polish court a 'flying dragoon' was invented, which could transport three men from Warsaw to Constantinople within 12 hours!

Then it became endemic in parliamentary life. The right to cast a veto grew into fetish, particularly among the minor Szlachta who saw it as a symbol of their personal involvement in the Commonwealth, as well as the ultimate guarantee of their freedoms. That the King viewed it differently is obvious. One should know that policy-making in Poland was not frozen because of the power of the veto. The King had to create Grand Compromises to ensure an at least acceptable outcome. However, as the Polish society slowly lost its consensus it was harder and harder go reach a compromise. It was especially cumbersome when planning and scheming had been going on for many months and suddenly in the last minute of passing the proposal in the Sejm. Someone rose and threw a Veto... Then again, sometimes the proposal actually passed.

Merely the different political climate during the earlier days of his reign is a proof of him being a very special monarch. He was never that limited by vetoes or articles as earlier monarchs, but in the end he chose a different path. He chose to continue the campaign against the Ottoman, a campaign he could not win decisively, while at the same time having to cope with growing dissent from magnates disliking this policy. When he stopped campaigning he suffered heavily from gallstones and he never managed to make the magnates forget that he was just one of them. He never managed to translate his popularity in the Szlachta, as whole, into concerted political action. If he instead had gone home after relieving Vienna and picked a fight with the magnates something completely different might have happened. Well who knows...?

On the same evening a small group of malcontents 'elected' Friedrich Augustus, who marched into Poland at the head of a Saxon army. On September 15th, as the Prince de Conti, escorted by a French squadron under Jean Bart, was sailing through the Sound, Friedrich Augustus was crowned in Kraków by the Bishop of Kujavia as Augustus II of Poland. At the end of the month the Prince of Conti came ashore only to discover that he had been pipped at the post. His supporters were not keen to start a civil war, so he re-embarked and sailed back to France.

	#-#In 1697 Friedrich Augustus II became King of Poland. His reputation was never good. He was a German and because of his inabilities to win a war he himself had started he is considered a rather bad Polish King. However, when Friedrich Augustus became King he had a plan. He was not a stupid man, and he intended to turn the Commonwealth into a centralized monarchical state. He was a child of the same ideas as his contemporaries in Berlin, Hannover and München, and he needed a war to accomplish it. Like Sobieski, he saw war as the surest way to gain prestige and a free hand to carry out his plan. Now Friedrich Augustus made certain mistakes. He and his allies underestimated the ease with which they would smash the eighteen year old monarch of Sweden and secondly Friedrich August was no Sobieskian General. The failure of the war and his lost prestige from being a lousy soldier and having been forced to a humiliating abdication omitted every chance to reform anything. Instead he ruined any chance for monarchism in Poland and his return was with the arrivals of Russian bayonets. However... had he won the war and Poland had been a winner while Russia had become rather mauled then his position would have been different. Instead of buying art for his castles in Dresden he might very well have used that prestige and military power with boldness and brute force to accomplish the impossible...

However, with British and Dutch naval assistance, Charles XII landed on Zealand and promptly defeated the Danes, then moved to Estland where his badly outnumbered Swedes (1 to 5) won a crushing victory over the Russians. Instead of finishing the Russians, Charles moved against August II of Poland-Saxony and drove him out of Poland in 1704 (having the pro-Swedish Stanislas Leszinski elected King), then subjugating Saxony in 1706. While the Russians started the construction of St-Petersburg (1703) and rebuilt their armies, they also took parts of Estland (1704-1706). Charles then decided to march to Moscow via the Ukraine where the Cossacks under Mazeppa had again risen in revolt (1708). The harsh winter and Russian raids decimated his army and he was finally beaten at the battle of Poltava in 1709. The wounded King escaped to the Ottomans. The Russians were encircled by the Ottomans on the Prut River, but Peter succeeded through bribery to obtain a safe conduct in exchange for Azov. While Charles was still exiled in Turkey, Russian, Danish, Hanoverian and even Prussian troops captured most of the Swedish territory around the Baltic. Having emerged from Turkish internment, Charles got killed in 1718 in front of the Norwegian fortress of Frederickshald. The peace treaties that followed Sweden lost most of her Baltic empire.

That the King viewed it differently is obvious. One should know that policy-making in Poland was not frozen because of the power of the veto. The King had to create Grand Compromises to ensure an at least acceptable outcome. However, as the Polish society slowly lost its consensus it was harder and harder go reach a compromise. It was especially cumbersome when planning and scheming had been going on for many months and suddenly in the last minute of passing the proposal in the Sejm. Someone rose and threw a Veto...
