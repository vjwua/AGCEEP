His son, Murdac I, inherited the Duchy of Albany as well as the Earldoms of Fife and Mentieth from his deceased father. However, Murdac did not inherit his father's character and lacked capable administrative abilities, perhaps in part due to his absence from Scotland for a period of thirteen years following his defeat and capture by the English in the battle of Homildon in 1402. In 1415, Robert I had negotiated the release of his son in exchange for the Earl of Northumberland, but had inhibited any and all activities leading to the release of his captive nephew, King James I, the sole and rightful heir of the deceased King Robert III and thus the Scottish throne. Murdac I would attempt to maintain his father's policies, which were largely driven by dynastic ambitions since the Albany Stewarts were heirs to the Scottish Crown should James perish without issue.

Murdac found himself challenged by his eldest surviving son, Walter Stewart of Lennox. Walter was arrogant, ambitious, and impatient. He had married Isabella, the daughter of the aged Duncan, Earl of Lennox, in 1392. During Murdac's captivity in England, Walter was associated with the Earldom as Lennox's heir. Walter's influence in the Albany and Lennox estates had grown during Murdac's absence and had continued despite Murdac's return. Following the death of Murdac's eldest son, Robert, Murdac attempted to coerce Walter to yield his claim to the Earldom of Lennox to Murdac himself, threatening Walter with disinheritance of the Duchy estates of Albany. Walter successfully and violently defied Murdac on the issue and had won further popular acclaim for his actions. The independence of Walter had fractured the Albany Stewart family and threatened the dynasty.

Thus, the agreement permitted Buchan and Douglas to campaign in France for Charles VII, while maintaining fealty to James by supporting his release.

	#-#The death of James I's brother-in-law, the 4th Earl of Douglas weakened the position of Douglas's son and successor, Archibald Earl of Wigtown. Murdac was swift to take advantage. Earlier in the year, Murdac had promoted the interests of the Earls of March and Angus, rivals of the Black Douglases in the south lowlands, at the expense of the Earl of Douglas and in return had solidified their support. The intensified rivarlies in the south would now occupy the new Earl of Douglas while the Black Douglases would lose control over Edinburgh Castle to Murdac. The Regent was quick to ensure that the late Earl of Douglases's widow retained authority over a sizable portion of the Black Douglases's estates which further reduced the new Earl's authority.

Despite the readiness of Murdac I to work with the King, his control of the Earldoms of Fife and Menteith and numerous other lordships restricted royal authority in much of central Scotland. Murdac himself was in his sixties, and his succession represented a considerable political problem. Murdac's son, Walter, could not be allowed to inherit his father's estates. The issue was execerbated by the fact that James had no heir while Murdac had plenty. The Albany Stewarts had murdered James's own older brother and had prompted James's escape from Scotland so many years ago. Thus, James came to the conclusion that Murdac and his family had to be eliminated. The first step was the removal of the Earl of Lennox and his supporters, who had allied with Walter Stewart in order to resist James's release.

In return, Margaret agreed to surrender Berwick Castle, and promised an unguarded and rich southern England which the Scottish troops could plunder mercilessly.

The King vowed that if he gained the victory, then Andrew would thereafter be the patron saint of Scotland and his cross the flag of Scotland.

	#-#In 1565 Mary married her cousin Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, an English nobleman. The bridegroom was proclaimed Henry, King of Scots. Their only child was to become James I of England. Mary soon became disenchanted with Henry. He had become overbearing, arrogant and carried away by his new title. He made enemies of some of the powerful nobles and, because of that enmity, there was a plot to kill him. Some thought that Mary had knowledge of the plot. The rift between Mary and her husband became public knowledge. She turned to a Scottish nobleman, a very powerful man, the Earl of Bothwell, for support. He and other Scottish noblemen proposed to do whatever they could to help the Queen in her dilemma. This decision led to a failed explosion plot and to the strangulation death of Darnely. A few months later, Mary and the Earl married. This angered the populace who suspected Bothwell's participation in the murder of their King. Mary's subjects were outraged and turned against her. She was able to lead an army against them, and although it was equal in number to the confederate army, it was visibly inferior in discipline. On June 15, 1567, Mary's forces were defeated at Carberry Hill, and she was forced to abandon Bothwell and surrender herself to the confederate lords. On July 24, at Lochleven, she was prevailed upon to sign an act of abdication in favor of her son, who was crowned as James VI five days afterward at Stirling. Escaping from her island-prison at Lochleven on May 2, 1568, she was able within a few days to assemble an army of 6000 men. On May 12 her army was defeated by the regent Moray at Langside, near Glasgow. Four days afterward, in spite of the entreaties of her best friends, Mary crossed Solway Firth and sought refuge at the court of Elizabeth I, Queen of England, only to find herself a prisoner of Elizabeth for life.

Still being in Scotland at that time, James VI was proclaimed King of England as James I a few hours after Elizabeth's death by a Council of Accession.

However, if the rules of male primogeniture were upheld and the successor James VI, King of Scots, would become the legitimate successor on the throne of England, there were other male alternative heirs but none of them pressed their claims. Still being in Scotland at that time, James VI was proclaimed King of England as James I a few hours after Elizabeth's death by a Council of Accession. Many Englishmen viewed the Union of the Crowns in 1603 as a disaster. It created the problem of one King ruling over two Parliaments. To King James, now holding court in London, the Scottish Parliament was by far the more important of the two houses. At the time, his plan for a Union of Great Britain proved to be unpopular on all sides and it was quietly abandoned.

One of the first scientists to realise the importance of logarithms was Johannes Kepler, who used them in his astronomical calculations. Soon the logarithms became a widespread tool in mathematics, astronomy and, by the 18th and 19th century, in economics as well.

That would alienate two powerful factions in Scottish society through his actions: the Presbyterians and the Scots nobilty. The situation precipitated in 1637 when Charles insisted, without consultation, on introducing an English-style prayerbook into Scotland. That incited a revolution and the National Covenant was signed the following year. It essentially demanded huge radical changes in Scotland's governance (a free Scottish Parliament, a free General Assembly and the abolition of royal appointment of bishops) effectively limiting the power of the King by inflating the role of Scotland's nobles and Kirk.

Almost all the Scots hated Cromwell's occupation, with very few actively participating with the regime. This tense situation lasted until Cromwell died in 1659 and the regime crumbled without his guidance. When one group of officers determined to dissolve the remains of the English Long Parliament, called the Rump, a former royalist and commander of the largest force in Britain, George Monck, decided that enough was enough. He promptly marched his army down from Scotland to reinstitute the Rump. However once there he realized that probably the only real long-term solution to the mess was to restore Charles II as King. In February 1660 Monck reversed Pride's Purge, inviting all of the secluded members of the Long Parliament to return to their seats under army protection. A month later the Long Parliament dissolved itself, paving the way for the return of the King. Charles II was restored to the throne and Scotland's Parliament reopened. Because of co-operating in the Cromwellian regime, the Restoration kept Scottish Parliament and Kirk under the control of the monarchy. The Presbyterian governance of the Church was abolished and bishops were imposed on a largely Protestant lowland population. The ideals of the National Covenant seemed to be definitively put at end.

They were given license to preach if they accepted the King's authority, whilst the most radical ones, who believed the King had no right to interfere in the Kirk, were imprisoned, transported or executed. In 1685 when Charles II died and was succeeded by his brother James, paradoxically a declared fervent Catholic was at the head of the Protestant Kirk.He was accepted as King grudgingly by most English people, but when he started to force the issue of equal rights between Catholics and Protestants in the Protestant Commonwealth the issue heated up. In itself it might not have had such dire consequences, but in the light of Louis XIV revoking of the Edict of Nantes and the following the losses in the English Civil War, James VII (II in England) actions caused much anger and discontent. Thus the King's effort on behalf of Catholics was doomed. Seven eminent Englishmen, among them the Tory Earl of Danby and Henry Compton, bishop of London, wrote inviting William of Orange, stadholder in the Netherlands, to help get rid of James VII (II). William in need of an ally against France accepted the invitation and on the 5th of November 1688 his troops landed in Bixham. He slowly advanced almost unopposed on London giving ample time for those still loyal to the highly unpopular King to reconsider. In the end James II realized his weak position and fled to France.

	#-#After the Restoration, the Government tried to reinstate the moderate part of Presbyterian ministers in country's social life. They were given license to preach if they accepted the King's authority, whilst the most radical ones, who believed the King had no right to interfere in the Kirk, were imprisoned, transported or executed. In 1685 when Charles II died and was succeeded by his brother James, paradoxically a declared fervent Catholic was at the head of the Protestant Kirk.He was accepted as King grudgingly by most English people, but when he started to force the issue of equal rights between Catholics and Protestants in the Protestant Commonwealth the issue heated up. In itself it might not have had such dire consequences, but in the light of Louis XIV revoking of the Edict of Nantes and the following the losses in the English Civil War, James VII (II in England) actions caused much anger and discontent. Thus the King's effort on behalf of Catholics was doomed. Seven eminent Englishmen, among them the Tory Earl of Danby and Henry Compton, bishop of London, wrote inviting William of Orange, stadholder in the Netherlands, to help get rid of James VII (II). William in need of an ally against France accepted the invitation and on the 5th of November 1688 his troops landed in Bixham. He slowly advanced almost unopposed on London giving ample time for those still loyal to the highly unpopular King to reconsider. In the end James II realized his weak position and fled to France. James flight was interpreted as an abdication and William was offered the English crown. Many Scots exiles who had fled the Stuart regime returned with William from Holland, and a Scottish convention drafted the Claim of Right, which demanded a free Parliament and a Presbyterian Kirk.

They believed that the natural order of Scottish society, with the rightful Stuart King at the top, was being destroyed by the Presbyterians. William of Orange wasn't particularly interested in Scotland as his life-long struggle was with Louis XIV of France and he relied on the money markets of London and Amsterdam to fund his war with the French. His invasion of England in 1688 was in many ways an indirect war effort against the French King. Scotland was either an irritation or a source of much needed troops to William. William of Orange left the governance of Scotland to his lieutenants, like Dalrymple of Stair, whose simple solution to the problem of the Jacobite Highlanders was to threaten and violently suppress the Clans into submission. Dalrymple decided to make an example of his political attitude in sending troops to Glencoe to exterminate the clan of MacDonald. That massacre shocked Scotland and provided much propaganda for the Jacobites, who published copies of the orders and conspired with greater urgency. The Scottish Parliament declared the whole affair an act of murder and Dalrymple was forced to abandon his office.

Determined to bring the Highlands to heel, the army showed little mercy. Jacobites were rounded up, imprisoned or executed. Estates were forfeited, the clan system dismantled and weaponry, plaid and pipes were outlawed. For Highland culture it was a disaster. However, it was not a complete disaster for the whole of Scotland, as the defeat of the Jacobites was a good cause for celebration by most of the Scots people, expecially amongst the Lowland Presbyterians: the Union and the Scots Kirk were safe. In the south economic progress was increasingly viewed as the way forward, and if that future wasn't to be entirely Scottish then it was to be through the British Union and access to the trade routes of its empire.
