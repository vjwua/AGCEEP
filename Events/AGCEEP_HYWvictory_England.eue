Meanwhile in France segments of the French nobility, who had never become reconciled with English rule, saw this usurpation as an opportunity to regain their power.

On August 22nd, however, Admiral Coligny, a leading Huguenot, was assassinated. Ultra-Catholic leaders, fearing Huguenot reprisals, decided to strike first. On the 24th a three-day massacre of Huguenots began in Paris, and soon spread to nearby Catholic towns. The surviving Huguenot leaders redoubled their efforts to oppose the Ultra-Catholics, and their resistance increased accordingly.

After a first failure in the summer of 1570, Pope Pius V managed to convince major Catholic nations (except France) to join a Holy League against the heathens Turks, and it was proclaimed in May 1571. The League would lead to the great naval victory of Don Juan on the Turks at Lepanto, but would not outlast this first and final triumph.
