In 1391 and 1398 the Reddy defeated King Narasimhadeva IV, but in spite of this Orissa maintained control of its southern provinces. Around the turn of the century the Reddy Kingdom was wracked by civil war and Narasimhadeva took advantage of it to reorganize the south against future invasions. His son Bhanudeva IV decided to end the Reddy threat once and for all and led an expedition to the far south in 1434.

The cults had all but died out across India by the fifteenth century, but continued to dominate Orissa. Even there the Bhakti were losing ground to mainstream Hinduism as tribal deities were edged out in favor of Brahminical gods. At the same time popular religion became increasingly dominated by ritual and ceremonial pomp that required the presence of a priestly caste. The result was a formalized caste system with the Brahmins on top and very little social mobility. Although this made Orissa's faith more palatable to other Hindus it also eroded their unique culture. One way for the Bhakti to win back the populace was through royal support. As the servants of Purusottama, Oriya Kings built glorious Bhakti temples.
