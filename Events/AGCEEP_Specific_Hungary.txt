	#-#The Czech priest and professor Jan Hus developed radical reformatory demands on the base of the teachings of John Wyclif. Despite a guarantee of safe-conduct by Emperor Sigismund, he was executed at the stake for heresy at the Council of Constance in 1415. This could however not stop the Hussite movement in Bohemia. Hus' followers were rapidly growing, and when King Vaclav IV of Bohemia died and his brother Sigismund, already Emperor and King of Hungary was to succeed him, they, unwilling to forgive him the betrayal of Hus and afraid that he would suppress them, refused to acknowledge him and gained control of most of Bohemia proper - while the lands of the Bohemian crown and the catholic part of Bohemia accepted Sigismund. Due to its radical anti-clerical and anti-feudal tendencies Hussitism posed a big threat to the church and nobility in the countries adjacent to Bohemia. Several German and European princes therefore decided to oppose the Hussites and to support Sigismund in his struggle with them that lasted for almost two decades. Should we decide to fight these heretics, we should be aware that this would be internationally regarded as an intervention in favour of Sigismund as rightful King of Bohemia rather than a war of conquest, and that therefore, if Sigismund prevails and manages to restore royal authority, we would be expected to turn over any conquests in Bohemia to the Kingdom of Bohemia.

In 1423, two years after his coronation, Tvrtko tried to form closer relationship with Republic of Venice. In 1424, a small Ottoman army raided Bosnia as a warning, but this didn't change Tvrtko's mind much. In 1425, Tvrtko II started negotiations with Emperor Sigismund to join the league against Ottomans. He agreed to Sigismund's demand to name Count Hermann of Cilli, one of most powerful Hungarian nobles, as his heir. The alliance with Hungary was delayed, however, because of Hungarian failures against Hussites in Bohemia. After punishing Serbia for dealing with Hungarians, Ottomans sent another raiding expedition into Bosnia in 1426. Determined to ally with Hungary, Tvrtko II named Hermann of Cilli heir to the Bosnian throne if Tvrtko dies without a heir or his heir dies without one. In 1428, Tvrtko II got even closer to his goals by marrying daughter of a Hungarian noble.

After a quiet period, the rivalry revived when Duke Radoslav Pavlovic attacked and defeated the Republic of Ragusa because they tried to turn Cavtat, a town they bought from him, into a fortress. Duke Sandalj Hranic Kosaca immediately intervened on Ragusan side and attacked his archrival. King Tvrtko II was mostly helpless to solve the dispute. Since Duke Sandalj had the support of the Ottomans, Duke Radoslav asked Despot Djuradj of Serbia to broker peace. At almost the same time, King Tvrtko II went to war with Zlatonosovic family in eastern Bosnia. Since they were friends of Duke Sandalj and Serbian Despot, King Tvrtko II decided to throw his lot with Duke Radoslav. A real civil war started in Bosnia. As Kings faction began to loose the war, treacherous Duke Radoslav switched sides and joined the Serbian Despot's camp in 1433. This coalition of Serbian Despot and Bosnian Dukes put forth their own candidate for Tvrtko's replacement: Radivoj. The hostilities temporarily ceased when Emperor Sigismund announced his support for King Tvrtko II and Despot Djuradj withdrew from the conflict. Hungarian army arrived as promised in 1434 and changed the tide of the battle. Coalition of rebellious Dukes was defeated and forts held by Ottomans liberated. Duke Sandalj was crushed by Duke Djuradj Vojsalic, who joined forces with King Tvrtko II when Hungarian army arrived, and died from illness in March 1435. King Tvrtko traveled to Hungary to swear vassalage to Emperor Sigismund. Upon his return to Bosnia, he started a campaign together with Duke Radoslav Pavlovic to destroy Stepan Vukcic, the new Duke Kosaca. King Tvtrko II was also aided by Croatian Princes Ivan and Stepan Frankopan who acted on the orders of Emperor Sigismund. Ottomans intervened on the behalf of Stepan Vukcic and reconquered one of the forts in Bosnia holding it against Hungarian troops until the end of the conflict. In 1436, Ivan Frankopan is denied the succession of the estates that belonged to his late father-in-law and switches sides to join Duke Stepan Vukcic. Hungarian army defeated and probably killed Ivan Frankopan. King Tvrtko II realized that he will not be able to expel the Turks from Bosnia and crush Stepan Vukcic, so he renewed his oath to Ottoman Sultan and reconciled with his enemy. Together with Stepan Vukcic and the Ottoman forces, the King turned on Duke Radoslav and utterly defeated him in 1438.

	#-#In 1439 Albrecht of Habsburg, King of Hungary, fell ill, probably of cholera, while campaigning against the Ottomans. Within one month he died, leaving two minor daughters and his pregnant wife Elizabeth. For the case of the unborn child being male, Albrecht declared that his son would be his successor in all his fiefs just before his death. Based on this will, Elizabeth attempted to get the Parliament to appoint her Queen Regent for her unborn baby. Still feeling menaced by the Ottomans, a majority of the Diet consisting mostly of the middle and lower nobility however did not want to trust the country's fortune upon a woman and an unborn child and, led by the Transylvanian noble Janos Hunyadi, desired an adult King with a decent powerbase instead. It was Hunyadi who proposed the most obvious choice, Wladyslaw III, King of the other big Christian Kingdom in East Europe, Poland. Initially with the consent of Elizabeth, deputies of the Diet approached the nineteen-year-old Wladyslaw in Krakow and offered him the Hungarian crown. Meanwhile, Elizabeth gave birth to a son, the male heir Albrecht and she had hoped for, and called him Ladislaus. Since then, she was determined to secure the throne for her child and thus withdrew her approval of the offer to the Polish King. But instructed by Hunyadi and other magnates, negotiations continued. When Wladyslaw eventually accepted the proferred throne on March 8th 1440 and everything seemed ready for his coronation and the union of the two Kingdoms, Elizabeth fled Hungary to Austria with her son and the stolen Holy crown of Hungary. She had Ladislaus crowned King in Székesfehérvár on May 1st, more than two months before Wladyslaw's coronation on July 17th. The scene was set for a civil war between the supporters of Elizabeth and Ladislaus, called 'Loyalists' who were strongest in Western Hungary and Slovakia and championed by Ulrich of Cilli on the one side and the supporters of Wladyslaw, the 'Nationalists', based largely in the East and Transylvania and led by Janos Hunyadi, on the other.

	#-#When the conflict between Loyalists, who supported the rightful infante King Ladislaus Postumus, son of late Emperor Albrecht I, and Nationalists who wanted to install Polish King Wladyslaw, Despot Djuradj was not in a position to choose sides. His daughter's marriage with Ulrich II of Cilli, leader of Loyalist faction, already made his decision for him. Although Djuradj wasn't in a position to offer much active support to Ulrich's faction, Count of Cilli still maintained good relationships with his father-in-law. Unable to help his son-in-law and also unable to win King Wladyslaw's favor, Despot Djuradj turned to Republics of Venice and Ragusa for help, but both refused. His flight to Venice antagonized both Hungarians and Ottomans. King Wladyslaw seized Djuradj's estates in Hungary, while the Ottoman Sultan blinded his sons Grgur, who lead the Serbian unit in Ottoman army, and Stevan who was captured when Smederevo fell to Turks. However, King Wladyslaw came to understand the threat Ottomans represented and the small but significant aid the buffer Despotate of Serbia can provide. After spending some time fighting for the Venetians in Zeta, Despot Djuradj traveled back to Hungary to make peace and alliance against Ottomans with the new King. He succeeded, aided by their joint fear of Turks and help of Janko Hunyadi, a Wallachian noble and the leader of Nationalists who also served in the army of Stefan Lazarevic.

	#-#After King Wladyslaw managed to pacify the opposition Hungary, he turned his attention to the Ottoman Empire. At the same time, this problem was brought more closely into the attention of other Christian powers. Knights of Saint John, remnants of the Byzantine Empire and Republic of Ragusa were the most active in demands for coordinated offensive against the Turks. The dynastic civil war in Ottoman Empire made these initiatives sound more realistic than before. Pope's first reaction was to send Cardinal Julian Cesarini to aid the pacification of Wladyslaw's opponents in Hungary. Between Cesarini's splendid efforts and Hunyadi's great military leadership, Hungary was more ready for war than ever. Hunyadi won his first crushing vicotory against an invading Ottoman army in Hungary in 1442, and already in 1443 he broke the 80000-strong Ottoman army in Wallachia. These victories and the news of Ottoman defeat against Karaman greatly emboldened the Christian monarchs. Just after Hunyadi's victory in Wallachia, the Pope decided to aid the war effort with a fifth of his annual income. In June 1443, an army of 25,000 with focus on cavalry headed south to attack the Ottomans in Serbia. The army was lead by King Wladyslaw himself and his most loyal vassals: Janos Hunyadi, Djuradj Brankovic and Dracul. In November, Janos Hunyadi lead the charge of 12000 Hungarian knights that completely broke the Ottoman army near Nis. Sofia fell to Christian forces in December. The winter stop the Christian invasion and tired Hungarian soldiers returned to their Kingdom in January 1444. Invasion resumed in June 1444, aided by a fleet made of Venetian and Papal galleys, with Burgundian fleet on its way.

The measure of the crisis can be judged by the fact that for the first time ever Hungarian Towns were represented. Pointing out the necessity of united action against the Ottomans, Hunyadi achieved a settlement. The former supporters of Ulászló acknowledged Ladislaus Postumus as rightful King and the Diet demanded Emperor Friedrich V to turn over Ladislaus, who was kept in Vienna, and the Holy Crown of St. Stephen to the Hungarian people. Until the return of Ladislaus seven 'Captains' elected by the Diet were to rule the country and to restore law and order. Hunyadi was the first and most powerful of these Captains and five of the rest were his supporters. Only the final man to make up the seven was not one of his choice. The Hussite mercenary captain Jan Jiskra had built such a strong base in Slovakia and surrounding districts that he could not be ignored if the Diet and Hunyadi did not want to have to fight him immediately. Despite the balance of power being firmly in favour of Hunyadi and his peers this temporary solution worked very well. Even most of the magnates who had been hostile towards Ulászló and Hunyadi did at this time not want to risk the Kingdom's very existance. In the following year, peace was maintained and relative stability restored.

A more permanent solution was needed and a new diet summoned at Pest in June 1446. Hunyadi's supporters among the populace and the lesser nobility very vocally demanded his appointment as Royal Regent, leaving the Diet with little choice, and Hunyadi was elected Gubernator of Hungary for as long as it would take to free Ladislaus, deliberately passing over the Palatine László Garai. The other magnates, distrustful of Hunyadi who had risen from a country squire to the most important person in Hungary within ten years, and envying him for his power and popularity, managed to install several limitations on Hunyadi's authority. A regency council, composed mostly of opponents of Hunyadi, was to 'assist' him in his duties, Garai stayed Palatine and kept some power and themagnates during the regency used every opportunity to resist Hunyadi and stall his measures. Nevertheless Hunyadi at the same Diet and another in 1447 got a whole series of popular reforms passed, e.g. the decree ordering the demolition of the new castles, most of them little better than robber-strongholds, the decree compelling the great officers of state to suspend their functions during the session of the diet, the decree declaring illegal the new fashion of forming confederations afterthe Polish model, all of which measures were obviously directed against the tyranny and the lawlessness of the oligarchy. Due to the resistance of the magnates and wars against the Ottomans and Jizkra, most of these measures remained dead letter, but still some of them had the intended effect.

Several laws protected the towns and peasantry from encroachments of the higher classes, he tried to introduce a jurisdiction judging irrespective of status and simplified almost all branches of law, which gained him the epithet of 'the Just'.

He obtained the approval of Pope Paul II in 1465 and the Academia Istropolitana - Istropolis is the latin name of Preporok - was officially opened on July 20th 1467. It had four faculties, Arts, Theology, Law and Medicine, and soon became the cultural center of Slovakia and the focal point of Hungarian humanism.

	#-#Janus Pannonius (1434 - 1472) is widely considered the first significant Hungarian poet. His uncle, János Vitéz, Bishop of Várad, sent him to Ferrarra, where, besides rhetoric, Greek, Latin, philosophy, and poetics, Pannonius was also trained as a diplomat. He later went to Padua where he became a friend of Galeotto Marzio - Mantegna painted a portrait of the two which has unfortunately been lost. Pannonius' sharp witted poetry like 'One for Pope Paul': 'Rome, do not ask for the Pontiff Paul to be testicle-tested!/ Isn't his daughter herself manly enough, like her Dad?' made him famous throughout Italy. Pannonius earned his doctorate in 1458 and returned to Hungary to serve as personal secretary to King Mattias Corvinus. In 1459 he became Bishop of Pécs. He devoted most of his time as Bishop to political writings. He was later appointed Head Chamberlain to the Queen and then sent to Rome to consult with the Pope about the Turkish threat. In 1468 he accompanied the King on his war in Morava and around 1470 he was made Palatine in charge of southern Hungary and Slavonia. The King, however, soon distanced himself from Janus which caused the poet to join a conspiracy against the King which was quickly quashed. Pannonius died in the castle of his friends the Brothers Thuz near Zagreb. King Corvinus then collected his poetry for inclusion in the King's library - the Corvinae.

Both were deeply distrustful of each other, Friedrich accusing Mathias of maintaining a secret agreement with the Ottomans and letting their raiding troops pass through Hungarian lands for their invasions of Austria. When Mathias was still fighting Vladislav Jagiello of Bohemia to gain the Bohemian throne - that he had been promised by the Pope -, Friedrich formally recognized Vladislav as King of Bohemia and elector of the Holy Roman Empire. The rivaly deteriorated into a personal feud after Friedrich in 1477 had given sanctuary to one of Mathias' advisors, Johann Beckenschlager, the Archbishop of Esztergom, who had left Hungary because of a disagreement with Corvinus. This caused Mathias to invade Austria and siege Vienna, which made Friedrich grudgingly accept a truce by which he acknowledged Corvinus as Bohemian King and promised to abandon his support for Beckenschlager. However only two years later Friedrich got Beckenschlager elected Archbishop of Salzburg. Mathias decided this provocation was too much, and began a determined invasion of Austria and Styria with the goal to humiliate Friedrich and expand his territory.

	#-#In the last years of his reign Mathias Corvinus tried to ensure the succession of his highly gifted, but illegitimate son Janos, made him the largest landholder in Hungary after the King by several grants of territory, put him in charge of several of the strongest and most important fortresses, gave him the holy crown of St. Stephen and got a majority of the royal council to support Janos. However Mathias died of a stroke before the matter was definitely secured, and the young, inexperienced Janos was soon deprived of his rights and his property by the Hungarian magnates who were fed up with the strong central rule introduced by Mathias and desired a monarch 'whose beard they could hold in their fists'. Such a candidate was found in Vladislav Jagiello, King of Bohemia since 1471. Called 'King All Right' by his Bohemian subjects because of his weakness, irresoluteness and saying yes to everything, obviously completely incompetent for ruling a Kingdom and having already initiated a rapid decline of Bohemia, he was the easily controllable puppet King the magnates were looking for. Vladislav was elected King on July 5th 1490 and immediately thereafter accepted the compact of Farkashida in which he confirmed all existing privileges of the nobility and took back all legal and administrative reforms, including the efficient system of taxation regarded as repressive by the magnates. After 3 decades of prosperity and modernisation, the election of Vladislav initiated a rapid decline, ending up in the disaster of Mohacs. Another candidate to the throne was Maximilian of Habsburg who maintained the claim of his father Friedrich III, but since he had already proven to be a capable ruler and would have been likely to use his powerbase in the Empire, Austria and Burgundy to consolidate his authority in Hungary, he was no popular choice. Had Janos Corvinus indeed managed to become King, he might have continued the achievements of his father, but would have been violently opposed by the powerful magnates.

	#-#In the last years of his reign Mathias Corvinus tried to ensure the succession of his highly gifted, but illegitimate son Janos, made him the largest landholder in Hungary after the King by several grants of territory, put him in charge of several of the strongest and most important fortresses, gave him the holy crown of St. Stephen and got a majority of the royal council to support Janos. However Mathias died of a stroke before the matter was definitely secured, and the young, inexperienced Janos was soon deprived of his rights and his property by the Hungarian magnates who were fed up with the strong central rule introduced by Mathias and desired a monarch 'whose beard they could hold in their fists'. Such a candidate was found in Vladislav Jagiello, King of Bohemia since 1471. Called 'King All Right' by his Bohemian subjects because of his weakness, irresoluteness and saying yes to everything, obviously completely incompetent for ruling a Kingdom and having already initiated a rapid decline of Bohemia, he was the easily controllable puppet King the magnates were looking for. Vladislav was elected King on July 5th 1490 and immediately thereafter accepted the compact of Farkashida in which he confirmed all existing privileges of the nobility and took back all legal and administrative reforms, including the efficient system of taxation regarded as repressive by the magnates. After 3 decades of prosperity and modernisation, the election of Vladislav initiated a rapid decline, ending up in the disaster of Mohacs. Had Janos Corvinus indeed managed to become King, he might have continued the achievements of his father, but would have been violently opposed by the powerful magnates.

	#-#Lajos II (Louis), King of Hungary, Bohemia, and Croatia, was the last of the Jagiello dynasty in the two Kingdoms. While riding with his companions on a hunting trip, King Lajos fell off his horse after it was suddenly startled, causing him to break his neck. Lajos left no direct heir. The Diet, Hungary's Parliament, convened to decide who would be the dead King's successor. Two factions formed around the candidates who were most likely to succeed him. The first was Louis's brother-in-law, Ferdinand of Habsburg, and the other was János Zápolya of Transylvania. Ferdinand's claim was supported by Spain, Bohemia, England and the Papacy, while France, the Ottoman Empire, and Poland backed Zápolya. The Diet voted to give Zápolya the crowns of Hungary and Croatia. Ferdinand lauched a lightning campaign against the disorganized Kingdom, and managed to secure a portion of it for himself.

With Zapolya's death, Ferdinand again invaded Hungary to try to claim his inheritance. Finally the Ottoman Sultan, having had enough with the chaos in his vassal, Hungary, split the country into three parts. He kept Southern and Central Hungary for himself, giving Eastern Hungary to János Sigusmund, while letting Ferdinand hold the Western portion. Hungary would remain divided between the three countries for the next 170 years.

Already at war with the Turks, the Habsburgs now faced an uncompromising civil war. A threefold settlement was finally forced on the dynasty: the Treaties of Vienna and Zsitvatorok of 1606 and the legislation of the Hungarian diet of 1608. Together these secured for Hungary religious freedom, constitutional autonomy, and the right of habeas corpus.
