	#-#The Council held in Constance from 1414 to 1418 brought an end to the Great Schism, declared its superiority over the Papacy, deposed two of the claimant popes (Gregorius XII elected in Rome and supported by Bayern, Naples, Hungary and Venice and Benedictus XIII elected in Avignon and supported by Castile, Aragon and Scotland) and pressed to abdicate the third (Johannes XXIII elected in the council of Pisa) and eventually chose a new pontiff, Martinus V. The new elected Pope left Constance at the close of the Council in May 1418 and travelled slowly through Italy, lingered at Florence and did not venture to enter Rome until September 1420. In fact, anarchy reigned in the Church held territories as no real government was ever established in there since 1309 when the Pope was first 'taken captive' in Avignon. Ladislao of Anjou-Durazzo, former King of Naples and vassal to the Pope, had occupied Rome and the whole Patrimonium Petri, whilst Braccio da Montone, former commander of Papal troops, was destabilizing the State of the Church from inside by looting villages and trying to establish his own Signoria in Umbria. Turmoil was everywhere...

	#-#Entering his dominions, the Pope's first task was to restore the State of the Church to the prosperity and order to which it had become a stranger. In doing this he tried to gain external political support which he eventually obtained from Giovanna II of the House of Anjou-Durazzo and Queen of Naples, also known as Giovannetta or the 'Queen-Bee' for her dissolute life. In exchange for the repossession of the Papal territories, which her brother Ladislao formerly occupied when Rome had no ruler, Giovanna was legitimately enthroned Queen of Naples by the Pope in a solemn ceremony held in the city of Naples on 28 October 1419. But the Pope desperately needed troops to bring back the order over the territories of the Papal Legations in Umbria, Marche and Romagna, where the populations rebelled thanks to the abuses perpetrated by Braccio da Montone's mercenaries, and asked Giovanna II for help. Promptly the Queen sent her best condottiero, Muzio Attendolo, 'lo Sforza', commander of Neapolitan troops to help the Pope in his fight for the reacquisition of the Church territories.

He wanted to take control of Naples immediately without waiting for the Queen's death. He soon imprisoned Caracciolo, Giovanna's lover, but he failed to capture the Queen. Muzio Attendolo Sforza, the Neapolitan condottiero in the service of the Pope, informed that Giovanna was in great danger, went hastily to Naples and rescued her. It was then easy for the Pope to convince the Queen to adopt Louis III of Anjou, Count of Provence, instead of Alfons of Aragon. Taking advantage of the absence of Alfons due to his problems in Aragon, and with the military help of Visconti, Duke of Milan and Signore of Genoa, the Aragonese were expelled from Naples, and Giovanna appointed Louis as Duke of Calabria, the heir's title.

However the Neapolitan people, determined to respect the will of their former Queen, ignored the Papal resolution and sent a delegation to Provence to urge René of Anjou to claim the throne in Naples. Since René of Anjou had been taken captive in Burgundy by Duke Philip the Fair, his wife Isabelle of Lorraine accepted the crown in his place. From his base in Sicily, Alfons of Aragon, who was designated heir by Giovanna between 1420 and 1423, and had a claim to Naples as King of Sicily, gained the support of the Neapolitan nobility hostile to the Anjou dynasty, and started making preparations to invade the Kingdom before the French Angevins could arrive in Naples and take the crown.

In 1438, René of Anjou paid a huge ransom to Burgundy for his release, and arrived in the Kingdom, but since he had exhausted his funds his allies abandoned him and he had to retreat to Naples. A long siege was then established, during which the Infante Don Pedro was killed by a chance shot to the great grief of his brother. The support of the Genoese fleet allowed René to sustain the besieged capital, but finally on June 1, 1442, 300 well-armed men entered the town through an open drain accesible during the dry season, revealed to Alfons' son Ferrante by some prisoners. After several hours of fighting, Naples was conquered and René escaped to Florence. After conquering the rest of the Kingdom, Alfons entered the capital in triumph on February 23, 1443. Pope Eugenius refused to invest Alfons as King of Naples and threatened to declare him in unlawful possession of Naples, Sicily, Corsica and Sardinia. Alfons threatened back with his support for an anti-Pope, Felix V, chosen at the Council of Basel, and Eugenius accepted to invest him in exchange for his support as the genuine Pope and help against the Turks that never materialized. Ferrante was named Prince of Calabria, and the Neapolitans were pleased that their Kingdom was not going to be incorporated to Aragon. Alfons, who as a Castilian had always felt a foreigner in Barcelona, never returned to Aragon, and his court in Naples was filled with the splendor of the Renaissance.

After his election, Martinus V made his way to Rome and travelling slowly through Italy he was hosted in Turin, Milan, Brescia, Mantova, Ferrara and after avoiding the rebel city Bologna he reached Florence where he was welcomed. Fearing for an escape of Johannes XXIII, who although imprisoned in Bayern had still some followers there, Martinus V arranged for him to be moved to a nearer prison in Italy. During the trip, Johannes XXIII however managed to escape, but after a short stay in Liguria he went to Florence, recognized Martinus V as legitimate Pope and changed the name back with his own, Baldassarre Cossa. The last Pope of Pisa died in Florence 7 months later.

Emperor Sigismund, as well as the Polish King Jagiello and Lithuanian Grand Duke Vytautas were the major participants. During the meeting the Emperor offered a crown of independent Kingdom of Lithuania to Vytautas. Jagiello apparently agreed, but after the uproar in the Polish camp, he quickly rescinded his agreement and hastily left the meeting together with Polish nobles. Soon after, Jagiello offered Polish crown to Vytautas citing poor health and inability to rule, which Emperor Sigismund agreed to. However, the Pope, recognizing a danger of recently converted Lithuanian lands being lost to Orthodoxy, forbade the sending of the crown, and Polish nobles led by Zbigniew Olesnicki captured it on its way to Wilno.

Consequently the campaign were very exhausting and dragged on interminably, some battles were won and others lost, truces and peace treaties were made only to be broken, and no definite result was achieved. A peace treaty was also stipulated in Ferrara in 1428 in which at first Visconti stated to renounce claims to territories lying beyond the Panaro-Magra Rivers, but refused to concede the territories of Bergamo and Brescia to Venice, which was still occupying with her troops. Political and economic interests of both sides were conflicting and when the new Pope, Eugenius IV, was being suspected of involvement with the League to damage Milan, Visconti retaliated sending his troops to invade the Papal States. That represented a violation of the peace treaty and subsequently a new Antivisconti League was formed to wage war against Milan.

But their hostile natives prevented any settlement, and nothing was done until French noblemen Jean de Bethencourt disembarks in Lanzarote in 1402. Being succesful in the conquest of the island, he travelled the next year to Castile, and obtained from Enrique III the concession for the conquest of the islands in his name. He managed to conquer another three islands. But the three bigger islands could not be conquered, as resistance from the natives, of pre-islamic Berber origen, was strong. With the African explorations of Don Henrique, the Canary islands constituted a convenient base, and Henrique sent two expeditions, in 1424 and 1427, that failed due to native resistance and lack of supplies. When Duarte became King in 1433, he activated his diplomacy, and was granted by Pope Eugenius IV, the right to Christianize the islands that remained pagan, given the success of Portugal against the North African Muslims.

The argument must have been a good one, because Eugenius IV, knee deep in his problems with the Council of Basel, reversed his previous decision and published a bull in 1436 recognizing the rights of Castile to all the islands and exhorting Portugal to not enter a war with Castile over them. There would still be a couple of failed attempts at their conquest by the Portuguese in 1448 and 1455, but with the finding of better islands in the coast of Africa to act as bases, the interest for the Canary islands decayed. Meanwhile the Castilians were advancing all the time in their settlement, and finally between 1477 and 1496 the Catholic King's armies fully conquered the remaining islands.

With that treaty Sforza was legitimated Duke of Milan. Without even being called for, Florence and the Pope had no choice then to endorse the treaty. The King of Naples, being a rightful claimant on the ducal throne reluctantly joined the alliance under the condition to keep Genoa out of it. Intended 'infra terminos italicos', that treaty showed the objective impossibility for all the Italian major powers (specifically Milan, Tuscany, Venice, Naples and Papal States) to prevail upon each other in the struggle for the hegemony in Italy and that the better solution was to come to terms with each other. That would have also avoided the practice of very expensive and pointless wars in the next future. Although the treaty actually played a minor part in Italian balance of powers and so won't be able to avoid future wars of aggression from inside as well from outside Italy, the post-Lodi era historically represented a period of relative peace in which the figurative arts definitively flourished in the whole Italian peninsula, as well as economy and trade and, last but not the least, the skills and tricks of the art of diplomacy.

He got George of Podiebrad who was a Hussite himself to promise converting to Catholicism and suppressing all heresy in Bohemia just before his election in 1458. Podiebrad however, while indeed planning to return to the Roman Church himself, had no intention to persecute his former coreligionists and insisted on the Compactates. As a reaction, on March 31st 1462 Pius declared that the Compactates had been valid only for the generation that lived back then and were now invalid and demanded Bohemia's full return to Catholicism. At an assembly of the estates in Prague, George refused and said he would to his death remain true to the communion of both kinds, and that he was ready to risk his life and his crown in defense of his faith. Pius then quickly terminated negotiations with Bohemia and declared George a heretic in 1464. Encouraged by the church, the Catholic nobles of Bohemia began a revolt against Podiebrad in 1465. The King of Bohemia was officially excommunicated and his subjects released from their oaths on December 23rd 1466. Afterwards, the - theoretically now vacant - Bohemian throne was offered first to Friedrich of Brandenburg and, when he refused, to Matthias Corvinus of Hungary.

Other disputes where against the Este family in failing to provide the annual tribute for usage of Papal lands in the Romagna. To gain these lands from the Este family for his own family, Sixtus IV committed himself rather scandalously to Venice's aim in destroying the Kingdom of Ferrara, which he incited the Venetians to attack in 1482. Venice refusing to desist from the hostilities that Sixtus had instigated and for appearing to be a dangerous rival to the Papal States after taking all of the polesine, was placed under interdict in 1483.

Florence then refused to accept the papal nominee as archbishop, and organized an alliance between the major powers of Northern Italy - Milan Venice and Florence, that threatened the expansion of papal authority. In early 1477 the Pope met with members of the Pazzi family, who proposed to overthrow and replace Lorenzo de' Medici in Florence. They told the Pope that they would have to kill the Medici, and he did not oppose their plan. In April 1478 at high mass in the cathedral of Florence the conspirators attacked Giuliano and Lorenzo de' Medici as the host was elevated.

	#-#Because of his distrustfulness of the barons, Ferdinando was pursuing a policy aimed at strengthening royal authority at the expense of them, that attitude brought him to have many enemies amongst the nobles of the Kingdom. In 1485, when his son, Alfonso Duke of Calabria, decided to revoke all the privileges that granted the city of Aquila a certain political autonomy towards the Kingdom, arresting the local nobles and occupying the city with his troops, the city magistrates refused to submit to him chasing the Neapolitan troops away and asking Pope Innocentius VIII for help and protection. The Pope, already put out by the fact that King Ferdinando didn't pay the 'chinea' (the annual tribute a Neapolitan fief has to give to the Pope as suzerain), accepted to help by sending troops to Aquila. In a rally immediately arranged in Melfi to discuss about Alfonso's aggression to Aquila, the nobles led by Antonello Petrucci, Count of Policastro and Francesco Coppola, Count of Sarno, King's ministers and by Antonello Sanseverino, Prince of Salerno, all hostile to the Aragonese rule, agreed to revolt against the King, who in the meanwhile refused to come to terms with them and confirm their feudal privileges. The revolt resulted in a civil war by which both Papal and Neapolitan territories were systematically devastated by the contending armies. On 11 august 1486 a permanent truce was eventually signed between Ferdinando, the Pope and the rebelling nobles, The King of Naples promised to pay the tribute due to the Church, to forgive the unfaithful barons and to assign Aquila under the Papal suzerainty.

	#-#The presence of Charles VIII of France in the Kingdom of Naples scared the Italian princes, who had in a certain way permitted the French King to achieve his goal of settling there almost undisturbed. Venice and Florence were worried about a French hegemony in the peninsula. French military presence wasn't limited to Southern Italy but also to villages of Tuscany and the Papal States, which previously surrendered to Charles VIII in his march towards Naples, strategically located to grant the French military supply line. The Pope, who previously granted the French King military access through the Papal territories and consented his stay in Rome, felt in jeopardy as much as to refuse Charles VIII being proclaimed King of Naples. Also King Ferdinand of Aragon couldn't accept the French presence in a Kingdom where he instead, in spite of Alfons V's testament which assigned Naples to the other Trastamara branch, could be the one to have claims there. The position of Naples was also important for the Aragonese trading in the Mediterranean. The Duke of Milan, who decisively affected Charles VIII's decision to settle in Naples, was now alarmed by the presence of French reserve troops deployed in the county of Asti, very close to Milan and at the order of the Duke of Orléans, who had dynastical claims to the Milanese throne. So Venice, Milan, the Pope, Spain and even the Holy Roman Empire (so firmly opposed to the French expansionism in Italy as to join any Anti-French alliance available) consequently formed the Anti-French league in Venice on 31 March 1495. Florence preferred to stay out because of her internal problems caused by Charles VIII's passage and decided to support France instead. Having heard about those arrangements and fearing that the confederates would isolate his army in Italy, Charles VIII decided to return to France for reinforcements leaving his regent in Naples. He had to move his army quickly through the Apennines as to reach the Alps and then safety, but the presence of heavy artilleries and carriages transporting the big loot he accumulated across Italy, slowed his march down. Only at Fornovo on the Taro River, in the Po Valley, Charles VIII finally faced the army of the confederates. Despite having lost all the carriages, he managed to reach the Alps gaining from his expedition to Italy nothing but his army decimated by epidemies.

	#-#On 7 April 1498, upon Charles VIII's death at Amboise (he knocked his head while passing through a doorway in his going to see a game of real tennis), the throne passed to his cousin Louis of Orléans, who reigned as Louis XII of France. On his accession, he took the titles of Duke of Milan and King of Sicily, sending a shrounding chill through Italy, especially to Ludovico Sforza, who had seized Milan from his nephew Gian Galeazzo, and that upon his death, had seen his claim legitimized by Maximilian King of the Romans. Louis XII came to throne in France with the clear idea of avenging his previous defeat by Ludovico and make good his claim to Milan from his Visconti grandmother. Milan and her dependency, Genoa, were seen as the key to Italy. So Louis XII, preparing to make good his claim on Milan, wanted to enlist the help of the main Italian powers, to avoid the mistakes of his cousin Charles VIII. In the meanwhile the anti-Venetian sentiment had been running high, attempts were made by Italian ambassadors to poison the relationships between Venice and the Ottoman Empire and try to induce the latter to declare war to the former. It was clear that Venice could very well side with the French and that occurred with the stipulation of the treaty of Blois, where Venice would recognize French claims to Milan and in exchange for military support and money would receive the Milanese territories east of the Adda river. Louis then stipulated a peace treaty with Ferdinand of Spain and enforced the truce with Maximilian of Habsburg. He made also a pact with Pope Alexander VI: in exchange for a papal bull to annul his marriage to the crippled sister of late Charles VIII and marry Charles' widow, Anne of Brittany, the Pope's son, Cesare Borgia, received the duchy of Valentinois with the hand of Charlotte d'Albret, sister to the King of Navarre and a promise of French military support to form his own duchy in Romagna. After having secured his friendship with Philibert II of Savoy Louis XII crossed the Alps and assembled his powerful army in Asti, a small county in Piedmont that belonged to the House of Orléans as marriage dowry of Valentina Visconti, his grandmother. In the summer of 1499, the French army led by Gian Giacomo Trivulzio, a Milanese noble, invaded the duchy of Milan from West, in the meanwhile, a Venetian army attacked from East. Town after town surrendered and the Milanese armies disappeared. As soon as a revolt broke out in Milan, Ludovico left the city together with his family and his treasure. By September 1499 the French troops made their entrance in Milan warmly welcome by the population.

	#-#As soon as Louis XII conquered Milan, he respected the pacts with Alexander VI and helped Cesare Borgia to carve himself a principality in Romagna and Marche. In November 1499 Cesare Borgia, also known as 'il Valentino' because of his ducal title, started his adventure in Romagna and Marche, territories belonging to the Papal States only nominally where the fiefs of Rimini, Pesaro, Imola, Faenza, Forli, Urbino and Camerino were declared forfeited with Papal bulls for the reason that they didn't pay the census to the Church. Imola and Faenza were his first conquests then he took Cesena but he had to suspend the military operations because of il Moro's restauration in Milan. He used the ceasefire to pay a visit in Rome for the Holy Year and to be appointed Gonfaloniere of the Church by his father. By the end of the year, Borgia resumed his military campaign and the following year, with the conquests of Pesaro, Rimini and Faenza, took control of Romagna, for which he obtained the ducal investiture by Pope Alexander VI. Cesare Borgia's greed wasn't yet satisfied, he also wanted to submit the cities of Bologna and Firenze, but since those cities asked Louis XII's military protection, he diverted to Marche principalities where he managed to easily submit the duchies of Urbino and Camerino. But in August 1503, both Cesare and Alexander fell very ill simultaneously, wether from an epidemy or poison it is unclear. Alexander died, and two days later the Orsini family rose against Cesare in Rome. Venice saw the opportunity to send troops to reinstate the petty tyrants in Romagna under condition that they should accept her suzerainity. They took direct control of Faenza, since the Manfredi were extinct, and of Rimini, which Malatesta surrendered to Venice. When Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere, a sworn enemy of the Borgias, was elected Pope with the name of Julius II, with the Venetian cardinals's support because he was favorable in principle to the Venetian interests, he saw that what Cesare Borgia had been doing was what was needed to bring the Papal States under effective control. But despite the arrangement with Cesare that gained his support in the Papal election, il Valentino was an obstacle, so breaking his word, Julius II got rid of him having the King of Aragon order his imprisonment in Spain. Cesare would escape two years later only to die helping his brother-in-law the King of Navarre quell a rebellion in 1507.

	#-#Venice, shorn suddenly of her commercial hegemony, bereft of friends or allies, under continual and increasing threat from the Turks in the East and the princes of Europe in the West, it seemed to her that her only long-term hope of survival lay in building up a broad mainland bulwark. Thus, when the dispossessed lords of cities that had fallen to Cesare Borgia sought refuge in Venetian territory, she had immediately offered them sympathy and shelter. And when, seeing Cesare facing a crisis in his fortunes, these nobles made determined and more or less simultaneous bids to reinstate themselves, she gave them her active support - always provided that they would accept her as their overlord and govern in her name. By the end of 1503 the banner of St Mark was already floating over Russi and Forlimpopoli, Rimini, Cervia, and Faenza. - John Norwich, A History of Venice, New York, 1989. Taking possession of Rimini, Faenza, and a number of other cities, Venice strengthened her position below the Po River where the city of Ravenna worked as strategic outpost since 1431. But Julius II, having secured his own control of the Papal armies by arresting and imprisoning il Valentino, quickly moved to re-establish Papal control over the Romagna (since it was amongst the territories ceded to the Holy See by Pepin III in 752 in what constituted the original Papal States) by demanding that Venice return the cities she had seized. Venice refused to surrender the cities, although willing to acknowledge Papal sovereignty over them and pay an annual tribute to the Holy See. After having unsuccessfully induced Venice to abandon Romagna by means of a Papal bull, the resolute Julius II began to look for allies. Only in September 1504 at Blois where Louis XII of France stipulated a treaty with which he renounced his claims over Naples in favour of Spain for the investiture of the Duchy of Milan, at the presence of the Emperor and the Archduke of Burgundy Philippe le Beau, the Pope let them include a secret paragraph by which the signatories would have allied against Venice. In facts Julius II did not possess sufficient forces to fight Venice even if for the next two years he recovered a few small towns in Romagna and managed to bring under Papal rule, Bologna and Perugia, both only nominally subject to the church and also to re-establish the order in Rome by means of political marriages between his family, the Della Rovere, and the rival factions of Colonna and Orsini.

In 1495 the life of the King of France was saved thanks to the immovable firmness of his Swiss foot-soldiers. At the beginning of the 16th century the Vatican began to employ Swiss mercenaries, who had a reputation of courage, noble sentiments and loyalty. Because of their faithful and disinterested service Pope Julius II in 1505 asked the Swiss Federal Tagesatzung to provide him with a constant core of 200 Swiss mercenaries for the protection of the Apostolic palace in Rome. In September 1505, a first contingent of 150 soldiers started their march towards Rome, they entered for the first time the Vatican in the evening of the 22nd of January 1506, where they were blessed by Pope Julius II. The prelate Johann Burchard of Strasbourg, Master of Pontifical Ceremonies at that time, and author of a famous chronicle, noted that event in his diary. Their first, and most significant, hostile engagement was on May 6, 1527 when 147 Guards, including their commander, died fighting the lansquenets lead by Charles de Bourbon, Constable of France, in the Sack of Rome.

	#-#Since 1495, Venice had been holding the main ports of Apulia despite Aragonese claims to have them back. With the French invasion of Milan, Venice had acquired Milanese territories east of the Adda River, and upon the fall of Cesare Borgia had also acquired Rimini, Faenza and Ravenna, against the will of Pope Julius II. The Venetians also held Veneto and Friuli, on which Maximilian of Habsburg had imperial claims. In late 1507 Maximilian announced his intention to travel to Italy to receive the imperial investiture from the Pope himself, and in early 1508 he assembled a big army to escort him down to Rome. He requested free passage through Venetian territories, but was told that he would be allowed passage only without his army. Enraged at the answer, Maximilian attacked Venice, but this decision proved unwise: Venice not only routed the imperial army but also seized the imperial cities of Trieste, Gorz and Fiume. A second assault by a Tyrolean force several weeks later was an even greater failure, forcing Maximilian to conclude a humiliating three-year truce. With Pope Julius II's assent, Maximilian took the title of 'Emperor-elect', thus breaking the century-old custom that the Holy Roman Emperor had to be crowned by the Pope. Shortly afterward, Venice provided a pretext for war by appointing her own candidate to the vacant bishopric of Vicenza. The Emperor, the King of France and Ferdinand of Aragon gathered in Cambrai in December 1508 to sign a treaty which seemed to be a defensive alliance against the Turk. In reality they meant to form a league to attack Venice and deprive the Serenissima of most of her mainland territories. Pope Julius II, after a renewed Venetian refusal to give the Romagna lands back to the Papacy, ratified the treaty and at the same time proceeded to excommunicate all Venetian citizens. Ferrara and Mantua, each with separate claims to territories held by Venice, joined the league as well. In April 1509 military operations started, and a month later French troops decimated one of the two Venetian armies at the battle of Agnadello. Even though in August 1509 Venice managed to eliminate Mantua from the war, she still faced the collapse of her strategic position and had by February 24, 1510 to accept the papal demands on the cities she had occupied in Romagna. However, Pope Julius II was still not satisfied and demanded that the war be prosecuted until Venice conceded control over their church to the Pope and compensated him for his expenses. The Council of Ten had privately resolved that the terms had been accepted under duress and were therefore invalid, and that Venice should violate them at the earliest opportunity. This opportunity presented itself shortly afterward.

Conditions were hard for Venice, the Republic had to renounce her traditional power to appoint bishops as well as all jurisdiction over Papal subjects in Venetian territory and was to compensate Pope Julius II for his war expenses needed to recapture the Papal holdings in Romagna, while the Pope accepted the humble request of the Republic for pardon, cancelling the interdict. But the reconciliation between Venice and the Pope did not stop the French to continue the war against Venice with attacks to her cities in Terraferma. Julius II, in the meanwhile, had become increasingly concerned by the growing French presence in Italy and formulated plans, both to chase the French out of the Po Valley and to seize the Duchy of Ferrara, a French ally, with the intention to add the territories of Modena, Reggio and Ferrara to the Papal States. In realizing his plan the Pope immediately excommunicated Alfonso d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, declaring his fief forfeited for his remaining loyal to France, then he gained the military support of Venice, eager to recover her territories lost to the French a armies and hired an army of Swiss mercenaries to attack Milan as to isolate the French armies in Italy. However his plans failed as the French army managed to invade Romagna and occupy the cities of Bologna and Ravenna, supported by the powerful and celebrated artillery of Duke Alfonso d'Este. In addition, in response to Pope's switching sides, Louis XII of France convoked a Schismatic Council at Pisa as to have the 'Warrior Pope' deposed. Pope Julius II, having unsuccessfully pressed the Republic of Florence to refuse hosting the schismatic cardinals, proclaimed the Holy League against France and convoked a Council of his own to meet at the Lateran in Rome. The promise of territorial gains at French expense caused Ferdinand II of Aragon and Emperor Maximilian I to abandon their alliance with the French, and in October 1511, they joined the newly-formed Holy League together with Julius II and the Republic of Venice. In November, Henry VIII of England and the Swiss confederation joined as well.

Thence the decision to withdraw from Milan. Julius II recovered Ravenna, Bologna and the rest of the Romagna, while his commander, the Duke of Urbino, easily occupied Reggio and Modena, though Alfonso d'Este refused any settlement that would deprive him of Ferrara. After having chased out the French from Italy, the congress of allies which met at Mantua in August made over to the Pope Parma and Piacenza, to which he had at best a shadowy claim. The Emperor and Fernando would have been glad to give Milan to their grandson Charles but the Swiss were in possession and, supported by the Pope, made their will good. The duchy was given to Ercole Massimiliano Sforza, the elder son of Ludovico. The Venetian claims were left unsettled with Brescia still held out and the Swiss claiming Cremona and the Ghiara d'Adda for the duchy. And more, the Emperor demanded Vicenza and Verona. Florence, who in 1509 had ended her long war by the recovery of Pisa, was punished for her support of France by the restoration of the Medici. Entering Milan, Ercole Massimiliano Sforza received the keys to the city from the Swiss soldiers, who promised to protect the duchy of Milan and to help the Duke in sending to him all the troops he would need. The Duke granted them the acquisition of the ducal territories Ticino and Valtellina, the most important accesses to the Alpine passes. Genoa drew back its allegiance to the French King, who in 1506 harshly repressed a local rebellion that broke out owing to the decision taken by the French governor to grant privileges to the nobilty. But Julius II made also a treaty with his late ally, Maximilian, against Venice. The emperor was to support the Lateran council to oppose that one proclaimed by Louis XII in Pisa and to hand over Modena to the Pope, while Julius II was to join in compelling Venice to give up the fiefs which the Emperor claimed since Cambrai and to use on behalf of his new ally also the always convincing 'spiritual weapons'. When this treaty was made public, it had only the effect to drive Venice to side with France.

Maximilian decided to support Charles, who in 1516 was already Archduke of Burgundy, King of Spain, Sicily and Naples, in his investiture as King of the Romans and future Holy Roman Emperor. But this diplomatic move would have been very expensive. Most of the German princes were already supporting the French candidate, King François Ier. Maximilian seemed to successfully convoy the favour of the imperial electors towards the Habsburg cause, by means of granting investitures and making promises of large sums of money with the help of bankers such as the Fuggers and the Welsers. The Pope, who couldn't accept the presence of an Emperor with territorial claims in Italy as it was under the rule of Emperor Frederick II, would have supported a German prince like Friedrich III of Saxony, with no particular interest laying beyond the Alps.

Pope Leo X was fascinated with the learned Muslim and freed him, after which Hasan converted to Christianity and took the name Giovanni Leone, or Leo Africanus (Leo the African).

	#-#On the 24 of February 1525, in the battle of Pavia, the imperial armies led by Ferdinando Francesco d'Avalos, Marquis of Pescara (also winner at Bicocca in 1522), decimated the French troops led by King François Ier. Many French leaders died on the battlefield, such as De la Tremoille, La Palice and Bonnivet. King François Ier, instead, fell from his horse shot out under him, and taken captive. Since 24 February was Charles V's 25th birthday, the Valois was the biggest gift he could ever receive. François was carted off to Madrid, where he was held six months in prison for ransom, and pressed to renounce his claims in Italy and Flanders, to give Bourgogne back to the Empire and to concede the county of Provence to Charles, Connétable de Bourbon, and now leader of the imperial troops. The Emperor believed that the peace with France had finally been achieved after François Ier, agreeing to renounce his claims in Italy, was freed and retaken to France, leaving his sons there as hostages and guarantees for the respect of the treaty. But within two months of his release and in spite of his sons taken as hostages in Spain, François Ier got the Parliament of Paris to void all the terms of the Treaty of Madrid because accepted under duress and in 1526 at Cognac he stipulated a holy league bringing into it Pope Clement VII together with Florence, Venice, Henry VIII of England and also the Duke of Milan, who even if previously restored to the throne by Charles V himself, voluntarily joined the alliance made to stop the Spanish hegemony over Italy.

	#-#The 14,000 lansquenets, hired by Charles V in the war against the League of Cognac under the command of Georg von Frundsberg, were animated by a violent spirit of crusade against the Pope (Frundsberg was bringing a golden rope with which he insanely meant to hang the Pope and his cardinals!) but also, and most of all, angry for lack of pay. Abandoned by their captains, they begun to plunder villages in search of loots. Soon they were joined by 6,000 Spanish soldiers lead by Charles, Connétable de Bourbon, and by any sort of ruffians of any condition (mercenaries at the Emperor's service, diserting or disbanded troops of the League and common criminals), all of them with the common aim to make the way to Rome, the city of sin, and 'sack' it. On the morning of 6 May 1527, from his headquarters set up on the Gianicolo hill, Captain General Bourbon with his 40,000 soldiers launched a series of attacks on Rome. During one of them, at the Torrione Gate, while leading the assault of the walls, he himself was mortally wounded (Benvenuto Cellini, who took part in the defence of the walls, would boast about having shot the deadly bullet). Instead of being let down, the Spanish troops' confidence was boosted by their commander's sudden death and at the expenses of big losses, managed to break through the city walls and enter the Borgo while the imperial lansquenets broke rushed towards the Holy See. Pope Clement VII and his followers were able to escape into safety, thanks to the 'Passetto', a secret corridor which Pope Alexander VI had built along the top of the wall connecting the Vatican with Castel Sant'Angelo. Across the Sisto bridge the bewildered soldiers fell on the unarmed city and for eight days committed every sort of violence, theft, sacrilege and massacre. The streets were a mixture of drunken soldiers, corpses and heaps of every sort of luxury goods taken from churches, monasteries and palaces. No league army dared to enter the city to drive out the ravaging troops and rescue the Pope, who accepted to pay a huge ransom only six months later.

	#-#The Emperor believed that peace had finally been achieved with France after François Ier agreed to renounce his claims in Italy. But within two months of his release, Francis had retracted from his word and signed the league of Cognac, bringing into it the Pope, Milan, Florence, Venice and England. But for Giulio de Medici, Pope Clement VII, it was a huge mistake to take sides with France, as Rome was sacked by the Lutheran German mercenaries of Charles under lack of pay. Charles got his army under control, and Clement became his prisoner, and had to pay 300,000 ducats and surrender several fortresses for his release. But in the meantime, the Florentines had raised and expelled the Medici, declaring a Republic, and part of the Papal States also wanted to become independent. Now Clement needed Charles more than the emperor needed the Pope and a deal was struck. Charles agreed to restore the Papal States, to return Florence to Medici rule, to name Clement's illegitimate son from a black slave Alessandro Medici, il Moro, hereditary Duke of Florence and to give him his own illegitimate daughter from a Flemish servant, Margaret of Austria, in marriage. In exchange Clement will crown him as emperor and will become his lifelong ally. The treaty of Barcelona was signed on June 29, 1529, and Clement and Charles will meet at Bologna at the end of the year, with the crowning taking place on February 24, 1530 in the same city. Charles V will be the last Holy Roman Emperor to be crowned by a Pope. A consequence of this alliance will be that Clement will refuse the divorce of Henry VIII from the emperor's aunt, Catalina, even at the cost of driving England into Protestantism.

Charles V used his strengthened political influence to definitely settle the Italian balance of powers and the conflicts between the Italian minors that deceitfully used to switch sides between France and the Empire. According to Mercurino da Gattinara's advices Charles V granted independence to all the imperial fiefs and, with the mediation of Pope Clemens VII, even to Francesco Sforza who was reinstated in his duchy in spite of his joining the league of Cognac. Pope Clemens VII instead, receiving the territory of Parma was to renounce his claims to Modena and Ferrara and to promise to arrange for a Concile in the next future to discuss about the Reform of the Church. Settled the political affairs in the peninsula, Charles was crowned by Pope Clement VII King of Italy on 22 February 1530 and Holy Roman Emperor two day later, in two solemn ceremonies arranged in Bologna. The imperial crown was a really big gift for his 30th birthday: Charles V resulted, in facts, the last Holy Roman Emperor in history to be personally crowned by the Pope.

	#-#The Gregorian calendar was proposed by Aloysius Lilius, a physician from Naples, and adopted by Pope Gregory XIII in accordance with instructions from the Council of Trent (1545-1563) to correct for errors in the older Julian Calendar. In February, 1582, Pope Gregory XIII issued a Papal Bull requiring that 10 days should be dropped from October 1582 so that 15 October should follow immediately after 4 October, and from then on the reformed calendar should be used. This was observed in Italy, Poland, Portugal, and Spain. Other Catholic countries followed shortly after, the Rest of the World adopted it only after 1700. In most countries it was also decided to adopt 1 January as the start of the year at the same time. In the Gregorian calendar, the tropical year is approximated as 365 97/400 days = 365.2425 days. Thus it takes approximately 3300 years for the tropical year to shift one day with respect to the Gregorian calendar. The approximation 365 97/400 is achieved by having 97 leap years every 400 years. These are calculated introducing a new corrective device to curb further error: century years such as 1700 or 1800 are no longer to be counted as leap years, unless they are like 1600 divisible by 400. If somewhat inelegant, this system was undeniably effective since the Gregorian calendar differed from solar year only by 26 seconds.

He found ready acceptance among some officials, for the Chinese took an intense interest in his possessions, such as clocks and Western paintings. Only in 1601 he was allowed entrance to the capital Beijing at the Imperial court of Wanli. There he became a court mathematician and astronomer. Although he made few converts, he brought Christianity into good repute. Unlike missionaries in South Asia, he found that Chinese culture was strongly tied to Confucian values and concluded that Christianity had to be adapted to Chinese culture in order to take root. He called himself a Western Confucian. He was renowned for his great understanding of Chinese culture. He helped translate many Western works on mathematics and the sciences into Chinese. His maps were eagerly perused by the Chinese, who gained from him their first notion of modern Europe. In return, Ricci sent back to Europe the first modern detailed report on China. He composed a number of treatises, the principal being a catechism, True Doctrine of God, which was widely printed in China.

Palestrina's fame and influence rapidly increased through the wide diffusion of his published works. So great was his reputation that in 1577 he was asked to rewrite the church's main plainchant books, following the Council of Trent's guidelines. His most famous mass, 'Missa Papae Marcelli', may have been composed to satisty the council's requirements for musical cogency and textual intelligibility. Palestrina ranks as one of the greatest Renaissance masters. In his sacred music he assimilated and refined his predecessors' polyphonic techniques to produce a 'seamless' texture, with all voices perfectly balanced. The nobility and restraint of his most expressive works established the almost legendary reverence that has long surrounded his name.

	#-#Sixtus V was a born ruler and especially suited to stem the tide of disorder and lawlessness which had broken out towards the end of the reign of Gregory XIII. Having obtained the co-operation of the neighbouring states, he exterminated, often with excessive cruelty, the system of brigandage which had reached immense proportions and terrorized the whole of Italy. The number of bandits in and about Rome at the death of Gregory XIII has been variously estimated at from twelve to twenty-seven thousand, and in little more than two years after the accession of Sixtus V the Papal States had become the most secure country in Europe. Of almost equal importance with the extermination of the bandits was, in the opinion of Sixtus V, the rearrangement of the papal finances. At his accession the papal exchequer was empty. Acting on his favourite principle that riches as well as severity are necessary for good government, he used every available means to replenish the state treasury. By the sale of offices, the establishment of new 'Monti' and by levying new taxes, he accumulated a vast surplus, which he stored up against certain specified emergencies, such as a crusade or the defence of the Holy See. He prided himself upon his hoard, but the method by which it had been amassed was financially unsound: some of the taxes proved ruinous, and the withdrawal of so much money from circulation could not fail to cause distress. He did not consider that in the long run so much dead capital withdrawn from circulation was certain to impoverish the country and deal the death-blow to commerce and industry. Though extremely economical in other ways, Sixtus V spent immense sums of money in erection of public works in Rome like rebuilding countless churches, beautifying streets and erecting new buildings and monuments. Far-reaching were the reforms which Sixtus V introduced in the management of ecclesiastical affairs. He limited the College of Cardinals to seventy and established fifteen permanent cardinalitial congregations, some of which were concerned with spiritual, others with temporal affairs. Although these congregations lessened the work of the Pope, they didn't limit in any way his authority, because the final decision always belonged to the Pope.

	#-#Michelangelo Merisi, one of the most extraordinary painters in the history of art, was born in 1571 not far from the village of Caravaggio (near Milan) where his family came from and after which he named himself. In 1592, he moved to the 'Rome of the Popes' with the prospect of large and lucrative commissions. Once there his painting skills attracted the attention of patrons who gave him also food and lodgings. In the beginning, all of Caravaggio's early paintings were relatively small works, still-lifes, genre-scenes and a few occasional religious subjects: it was said he had used a prostitute as the model for some of his depictions of the Virgin Mary. The big chance came in 1597 with the commission of two large paintings for the Contarelli Chapel in San Luigi dei Francesi about St Matthew's life. This commission made him famous as much as his life-style and violent behaviour made him notorious everywhere. His name appeared regularly in the protocols of the Roman police, however he received support and protection by some of the most sophisticated patrons in Rome. But in 1606 his violent temper didn't save him from murdering a person with whom he, unwilling to pay a bet on a real tennis match, got involved in a fierce fight. In hiding himself Caravaggio left Rome and went to Naples where, waiting for the Papal pardon which would allow him to return, he did some paintings. With no answer from Rome, Caravaggio left Naples and in the following year arrived on the island of Malta. In his stay on the island he painted his masterpiece 'the Beheading of St John', for which he was made Knight of the Order of Obedience. Soon his 'tormented nature' led him to quarrel with a noble knight and subsequently to escape from the island. Back to Rome he was imprisoned because of his former killing, however he managed to escape and flee to Sicily and then to Naples where he was badly wounded by two hired killers. In 1610 he decided to leave Naples and set sail to Porto Ercole in the Spanish held State of Presidi, at only 80 km far from Rome waiting for the Papal pardon. But there he was mistakenly captured by the local police and imprisoned for some days. After his release, discovering that his boat had sailed away with all of his poor belongings still on board, he was seen running insanely along the shore until he fell unconscious, caught by a raging fever which brought him to death a few days after. He was only 38 years old...

Nevertheless, the Cardinal found it appealing and put it on a marble pedestal in a small square. Each April 25, Cardinal Oliviero chaired a Latin literary competition in which sonnets were posted on the statue. The residents carried on with the practice of adapting literary poems into satire, a pasquinade, exhibited in a public place. That's how Pasquino became the first talking statue of Rome. He spoke out about people's dissatisfaction, he denounced injustice, and he assaulted the nepotistic system and the misgovernment of the Church. Severe laws however were issued to stop the practice and Pasquino was put under surveillance. This led to the undesired result of multiplying the talking statues of Rome. So the so-called Congress of the Witty was formed, with Pasquino always the leader, and Marforio, Abate Luigi, Madama Lucrezia, Facchino and Babbuino as his cohorts.

Galileo became 'Mathematician and Philosopher' to the Grand Duke of Tuscany. In Florence he continued his work on motion and mechanics and began to get involved in disputes about Copernicanism. Copernicanism was in contradiction with Scripture, and in 1616 Galileo was given some kind of warning that he was not to defend Copernicanism. Just what was said on this occasion was to become a subject for dispute when Galileo was accused of departing from this undertaking in his 'Dialogue concerning the two greatest world systems'. In October 1632 he was summoned by the Holy Office to Rome. The tribunal passed a sentence condemning him and compelled Galileo to abjure his theory.

Well known in Rome and Naples, he then travelled to London, where he was initiated into Freemasonry and in The Hague he founded the Egyptian Rite of Freemasonry. He travelled also throughout Russia, Germany, and later France, spreading the influence of the Egyptian Rite and also claiming to be a magnetic healer of great power. In France he was prosecuted in the affair of the diamond necklace which involved Marie Antoinette, imprisoned for fraud, he was then acquitted. Asked to leave he went to England, where he managed to refute accusations made to him of being Giuseppe Balsamo and forced a retraction and apology from his detractors. In 1789 Cagliostro left England to visit Rome, where he was arrested by the Inquisition on the charge of being a Mason. Imprisoned and tortured, he was sentenced to death, changed in life imprisonment by the Pope. Cagliostro died in a dungeon in 1795.

The crisis of the medieval Jubilee began in 1525 after the Theses of Martin Luther and the Protestant Reformation, when doubts rose about the opportunity whether or not to celebrate the Holy Year. In facts the Lutherans spread out several booklets in which they openly accused Pope Clemens VII to proclaim the Jubilee with the purpose to increase the Church's treasury only. However in April 1524 Clemens VII decided to promulgate the Jubilee with the papal bull 'Inter sollicitudes et coram nobis'. That papal bull exempted only the pilgrims in Rome from charity while anyone else, who couldn't reach the Eternal City, was still obliged to get indulgencies. For the first time the Holy Door of St Peter's was opened with a golden hammer. The Holy Year wasn't much participated due to the current Italian wars, to the fear for the advancing Turk and to the peasant's revolts in Germany. And more, in august 1525 there was a new outbreak of the plague while in May 1527, two years after that Jubilee, Rome was terribly 'sacked' by the imperial Lansquenets.

	#-#In 1800 the 20th Jubilee was to be celebrated, but the difficult political situation of the Church during the French Revolutionary Wars prevented Pius VII from proclaiming it. Unfortunately Napoléon was intentioned to vassalize the Pope and to force him to accept French cardinals, but when the Pope clearly refused to submit to his will he was imprisoned and transferred to France. In 1798 from his 'captivity' in France, while the Repubblica Romana was ruling in the Papal States, Pius VI ordered some cardinals to proceed in any case with the traditional papal election once he had died. So, on 14 March 1800, soon after Pius VI's death, a new Pope, Pius VII, was elected in St. George's monastery in Venice. Since it was too late to proclaim a Jubilee for that current year, on 24 May 1800 Pope Pius VII issued a papal bull 'Quod hoc inquente', with which he conceded the jubilary indulgence to anyone who, in the following 15 days, would have gone to confessions, received communions and visited churches, and not necessarily in Rome. The year 1800 was the only one hundredth year and the only one year to begin a century since 1300 in which the Holy Year couldn't be celebrated. Also, 1800 it isn't numbered as the 20th amongst the ordinary Holy Years. The 20th Holy Year was proclaimed on 24 may 1824 and celebrated in 1825 by Pope Leo XII after 50 years from the previous one. In that Jubilee St Mary of Trastevere took the place of the St Paul's Basilica as pilgrimage site since the latter was being rebuilt after a fire. The Jubilee saw the participation of 375000 pilgrims.

Portugal argued that they were closer to their coasts, while Castile argued that they belonged to the diocese of Tingitania (Morocco) and were therefore part of the Visigothic Kingdom to which they were entitled, and both monarchs contested the decision of Pope Clement VI to give the islands to Luis de la Cerda, a Spanish nobleman, in 1344. But their hostile natives prevented any settlement, and nothing was done until French noblemen Jean de Bethencourt disembarks in Lanzarote in 1402. Being succesful in the conquest of the island, he travelled the next year to Castile, and obtained from Enrique III the concession for the conquest of the islands in his name. He managed to conquer another three islands. But the three bigger islands could not be conquered, as resistance from the natives, of pre-islamic Berber origen, was strong. With the African explorations of Don Henrique, the Canary islands constituted a convenient base, and Henrique sent two expeditions, in 1424 and 1427, that failed due to native resistance and lack of supplies. When Duarte became King in 1433, he activated his diplomacy, and was granted by Pope Eugenius IV, the right to Christianize the islands that remained pagan, given the success of Portugal against the North African Muslims.

Curiously, the main argument used by Alonso was not that those islands were part of a group already half conquered by Castile, but that the right of Castile to the islands had the same basis that the right the monarchs of Castile had over their Kingdom, that they inherited from the Visigoth Kings, and these from the Roman Emperors. The argument must have been a good one, because Eugenius IV, knee deep in his problems with the Council of Basel, reversed his previous decision and published a bull in 1436 recognizing the rights of Castile to all the islands and exhorting Portugal to not enter a war with Castile over them. There would still be a couple of failed attempts at their conquest by the Portuguese in 1448 and 1455, but with the finding of better islands in the coast of Africa to act as bases, the interest for the Canary islands decayed. Meanwhile the Castilians were advancing all the time in their settlement, and finally between 1477 and 1496 the Catholic King's armies fully conquered the remaining islands.

When Pius II rose to the Holy See, he was determined to end this situation. He got George of Podiebrad who was a Hussite himself to promise converting to Catholicism and suppressing all heresy in Bohemia just before his election in 1458. Podiebrad however, while indeed planning to return to the Roman Church himself, had no intention to persecute his former coreligionists and insisted on the Compactates. As a reaction, on March 31st 1462 Pius declared that the Compactates had been valid only for the generation that lived back then and were now invalid and demanded Bohemia's full return to Catholicism. At an assembly of the estates in Prague, George refused and said he would to his death remain true to the communion of both kinds, and that he was ready to risk his life and his crown in defense of his faith. Pius then quickly terminated negotiations with Bohemia and declared George a heretic in 1464. Encouraged by the church, the Catholic nobles of Bohemia began a revolt against Podiebrad in 1465. The King of Bohemia was officially excommunicated and his subjects released from their oaths on December 23rd 1466. Afterwards, the - theoretically now vacant - Bohemian throne was offered first to Friedrich of Brandenburg and, when he refused, to Matthias Corvinus of Hungary. The King of Hungary accepted and began a campaign against Bohemia.

Conditions were hard for Venice, the Republic had to renounce her traditional power to appoint bishops as well as all jurisdiction over Papal subjects in Venetian territory and was to compensate Pope Julius II for his war expenses needed to recapture the Papal holdings in Romagna, while the Pope accepted the humble request of the Republic for pardon, cancelling the interdict. But the reconciliation between Venice and the Pope did not stop the French to continue the war against Venice with attacks to her cities in Terraferma. Julius II, in the meanwhile, had become increasingly concerned by the growing French presence in Italy and formulated plans, both to chase the French out of the Po Valley and to seize the Duchy of Ferrara, a French ally, with the intention to add the territories of Modena, Reggio and Ferrara to the Papal States. In realizing his plan the Pope immediately excommunicated Alfonso d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, declaring his fief forfeited for his remaining loyal to France, then he gained the military support of Venice, eager to recover her territories lost to the French a armies and hired an army of Swiss mercenaries to attack Milan as to isolate the French armies in Italy. However his plans failed as the French army managed to invade Romagna and occupy the cities of Bologna and Ravenna, supported by the powerful and celebrated artillery of Duke Alfonso d'Este. In addition, in response to Pope's switching sides, Louis XII of France convoked a Schismatic Council at Pisa as to have the 'Warrior Pope' deposed. Pope Julius II, having unsuccessfully pressed the Republic of Florence to refuse hosting the schismatic cardinals, proclaimed the Holy League against France and convoked a Council of his own to meet at the Lateran in Rome. The promise of territorial gains at French expense caused Ferdinand II of Aragon and Emperor Maximilian I to abandon their alliance with the French, and in October 1511, they joined the newly-formed Holy League together with Julius II and the Republic of Venice. In November, Henry VIII of England and the Swiss confederation joined as well.

After a first failure in the summer of 1570, Pope Pius V managed to convince major Catholic nations (except France) to join a Holy League against the heathens Turks, and it was proclaimed in May 1571. The League would lead to the great naval victory of Don Juan on the Turks at Lepanto, but would not outlast this first and final triumph. Selim II is rumored to have said, after the news he had lost 200 galleys at Lepanto: At Lepanto, the Christians have shaved me. At Cyprus, I cut their arm. My beard will grow again.
