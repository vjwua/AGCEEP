But as soon as the Venetians knew that Visconti imprisoned his family and confiscated all of his estates and that conspirators at the service of Visconti attempted to poison him, Carmagnola was appointed captain-general of St Mark in 1426 and the Antivisconti league-confederates declared war on Milan. Carmagnola's most important success was the battle of Maclodio (1427), but he did not follow it up. The Republic, impatient of his dilatoriness, raised his emoluments and promised him immense fiefs including the lordship of Milan, so as to increase his ardour, but in vain. At the same time Carmagnola was perpetually receiving messengers from Visconti, who offered him great rewards if he would abandon the Venetians.The general trifled with his past as with his present employers, believing in his foolish vanity that he held the fate of both in his hand. But the Venetians were dangerous masters to trifle with and their patience was soon to be lost...

Consequently the campaign were very exhausting and dragged on interminably, some battles were won and others lost, truces and peace treaties were made only to be broken, and no definite result was achieved. A peace treaty was also stipulated in Ferrara in 1428 in which at first Visconti stated to renounce claims to territories lying beyond the Panaro-Magra Rivers, but refused to concede the territories of Bergamo and Brescia to Venice, which was still occupying with her troops. Political and economic interests of both sides were conflicting and when the new Pope, Eugenius IV, was being suspected of involvement with the League to damage Milan, Visconti retaliated sending his troops to invade the Papal States. That represented a violation of the peace treaty and subsequently a new Antivisconti League was formed to wage war against Milan.

Filippo Maria Visconti of Milan, also Signore of Genoa, preoccupied for the increasing Aragonese influence in the Mediterranean sea trade routes as much as in the Italian peninsula, decided to support the Angevins. Alfons of Aragon was defeated and captured by a Genovese fleet at the battle of Ponza in 1435. Transferred to Milan, Alfons succeeded in gaining Visconti's favour to his cause against the French Angevins. He convinced Filippo Maria that a French presence in Italy could be against the interests of Milan since the House of Orléans had never hidden its dynastic claims on the Duchy of Milan. But Genoa, a bitter rival of Aragon during centuries of dispute over Sardinia, Corsica, and the control of the Western Mediterranean trade, was appalled by Visconti's sudden change of sides, and immediately asked for admission in the Venetian-Florentine league against her former suzerain.

Facing a new and stronger League, whose troops were commanded by Francesco Sforza, Filippo Maria succeeded in asking the condottiero to mediate with the League-confederates for an immediate peace. In exchange for that service, Sforza married Visconti's daughter Bianca Maria. Since Visconti hadn't yet any direct male heir, Sforza would be in condition to claim the throne at Visconti's death. In the treaty signed in Cremona in 1441 Venice obtained the suzerainty over the cities of Brescia, Bergamo and Ravenna while Visconti had to confirm the independence of Genoa and to give up definitely his ambitious plan of a reborn Lombard Kingdom in Northern Italy.

After 2 years and half of life, isolated and surrounded by the unfaithful Sforza, who in the meanwhile and with the support of Venice turned against the city of Milan aiming at the ducal throne, the Ambrosian Republic eventually ceased to exist. Brought to severe famine the citizenship of Milan was forced to surrender to the condottiero and accept him as their new Duke. As soon as Sforza proclaimed himself successor of Visconti to the throne of Milan and the Holy Roman Emperor didn't acknowledge him the ducal investiture, the war of succession inevitably began. Encouraged by that and as to continued her war of conquest Venice tried to renew her old alliance with Florence. But Florence was now ruled by Cosimo de Medici, a Sforza's friend, who instead resolved to support the condottiero in order to check Venice and her expansionist policy in Terraferma.

Francesco Sforza, ruler of Milan and Venice, the chief state of the league confederates, who was more and more threatened by the advancing Ottomans in her eastern Mediterranean territories, convened a cease-fire while a bilateral treaty was hastily signed in Lodi on 7 April 1454. With that treaty Sforza was legitimated Duke of Milan. Without even being called for, Florence and the Pope had no choice then to endorse the treaty. The King of Naples, being a rightful claimant on the ducal throne reluctantly joined the alliance under the condition to keep Genoa out of it. Intended 'infra terminos italicos', that treaty showed the objective impossibility for all the Italian major powers (specifically Milan, Tuscany, Venice, Naples and Papal States) to prevail upon each other in the struggle for the hegemony in Italy and that the better solution was to come to terms with each other. That would have also avoided the practice of very expensive and pointless wars in the next future. Although the treaty actually played a minor part in Italian balance of powers and so won't be able to avoid future wars of aggression from inside as well from outside Italy, the post-Lodi era historically represented a period of relative peace in which the figurative arts definitively flourished in the whole Italian peninsula, as well as economy and trade and, last but not the least, the skills and tricks of the art of diplomacy.

	#-#The only significant sources of silver left operating in Europe in early 1420s were mines at Srebrenica in Bosnia and Novo Brdo in soutern Serbia, and they shipped most of their production through the Venetian ports and fortresses that controlled the coast of Dalmatia, with an average outflow of about 20 tonnes of silver a year. As the Bosnian mines declined in the 1430s, the stage was set for a financial disaster, completed when the Turks overran the Serbian silver mines in 1455, and in 1460 captured the last Bosnian mine. The last Venetian silver grosso was minted in 1462. On 17th March 1464 Venice sent all the city's spare cash with the galleys to trade with Syria, leaving nothing in the city treasury but small and debased coins. The bullion crisis reached a point where trade was strangled. Compounding the problem, a genuine fear that creditors would be unable to find money to pay bills led to a restriction for credit. Such fears were real: several Venetian banks failed, and so did the Strozzi bank of Florence, the second largest in the city. Even the smallest of small change became scarce. But the crisis didn't last long. In the late 1450s, Martin Claus of Gotha solved the problem of the flooded silver mines of Saxony, just as Europe ran out of currency. The old mines quickly re-opened, and new discoveries were made in the Harz Mountains (the Erzgebirge). Thereafter, Saxon and Bohemian mining resumed at full scale from mines such as Kutná Hora, Freiberg, and Rammelsberg, and new mines were opened in other regions: at Schneeberg in Saxony and at Schwats in the Tirol, which was discovered in 1448. New supplies of bullion reached European economies, beginning in the 1460s, but especially in the 1470s and 1480s.

France was at odds with the Pope, Burgundy delayed their help, Milan was trying to seize Genoa, and Florence cynically advised the Pope to let the Turks and the Venetians wear each other out.

While waiting for the Venetian fleet, plague broke out and the crusade army melted away. On August 14, when the Venetians finally arrived, the Pope expired.

The State charged itself to discover heretics, who when caught were examined by the Patriarch, the Bishop of Castello, or any other Venetian Ordinary. The examining Court was confined to a return of fact. It was called on to state whether the examinee was or was not guilty of heresy. Punishment was reserved to the secular authority. This arrangement did not satisfy the Court of Rome, an Inquisitor was appointed by the Pope, but he required the Doge's exequatur before he could act, and a board was created of three Venetian nobles, to sit as assessors to the Holy Office. Their duty was to guard the rights of Venetian citizens against ecclesiastical encroachment, including the non-interference in religious matters within the colonies, without their presence and their sanction no act of the Holy Office was valid in Venice. The Inquisition in Venice was certainly no sanguinary Office, thanks no doubt in a large degree to the independent attitude of the State, which insisted upon the presence of lay assessors at every trial.

It was not written for a large audience, but intended to teach mathematics of everyday currency in Italy. The Treviso became one of the first mathematics books that were written for the expansion of human knowledge. It gave opportunity for the common person to learn the art of computation instead of only a privileged few.

	#-#The presence of Charles VIII of France in the Kingdom of Naples scared the Italian princes, who had in a certain way permitted the French King to achieve his goal of settling there almost undisturbed. Venice and Florence were worried about a French hegemony in the peninsula. French military presence wasn't limited to Southern Italy but also to villages of Tuscany and the Papal States, which previously surrendered to Charles VIII in his march towards Naples, strategically located to grant the French military supply line. The Pope, who previously granted the French King military access through the Papal territories and consented his stay in Rome, felt in jeopardy as much as to refuse Charles VIII being proclaimed King of Naples. Also King Ferdinand of Aragon couldn't accept the French presence in a Kingdom where he instead, in spite of Alfons V's testament which assigned Naples to the other Trastamara branch, could be the one to have claims there. The position of Naples was also important for the Aragonese trading in the Mediterranean. The Duke of Milan, who decisively affected Charles VIII's decision to settle in Naples, was now alarmed by the presence of French reserve troops deployed in the county of Asti, very close to Milan and at the order of the Duke of Orléans, who had dynastical claims to the Milanese throne. So Venice, Milan, the Pope, Spain and even the Holy Roman Empire (so firmly opposed to the French expansionism in Italy as to join any Anti-French alliance available) consequently formed the Anti-French league in Venice on 31 March 1495. Florence preferred to stay out because of her internal problems caused by Charles VIII's passage and decided to support France instead. Having heard about those arrangements and fearing that the confederates would isolate his army in Italy, Charles VIII decided to return to France for reinforcements leaving his regent in Naples. He had to move his army quickly through the Apennines as to reach the Alps and then safety, but the presence of heavy artilleries and carriages transporting the big loot he accumulated across Italy, slowed his march down. Only at Fornovo on the Taro River, in the Po Valley, Charles VIII finally faced the army of the confederates. Despite having lost all the carriages, he managed to reach the Alps gaining from his expedition to Italy nothing but his army decimated by epidemies.

Louis XII came to throne in France with the clear idea of avenging his previous defeat by Ludovico and make good his claim to Milan from his Visconti grandmother.

So Louis XII, preparing to make good his claim on Milan, wanted to enlist the help of the main Italian powers, to avoid the mistakes of his cousin Charles VIII.

It was clear that Venice could very well side with the French and that occurred with the stipulation of the treaty of Blois, where Venice would recognize French claims to Milan and in exchange for military support and money would receive the Milanese territories east of the Adda river. Louis then stipulated a peace treaty with Ferdinand of Spain and enforced the truce with Maximilian of Habsburg. He made also a pact with Pope Alexander VI: in exchange for a papal bull to annul his marriage to the crippled sister of late Charles VIII and marry Charles' widow, Anne of Brittany, the Pope's son, Cesare Borgia, received the duchy of Valentinois with the hand of Charlotte d'Albret, sister to the King of Navarre and a promise of French military support to form his own duchy in Romagna. After having secured his friendship with Philibert II of Savoy Louis XII crossed the Alps and assembled his powerful army in Asti, a small county in Piedmont that belonged to the House of Orléans as marriage dowry of Valentina Visconti, his grandmother. In the summer of 1499, the French army led by Gian Giacomo Trivulzio, a Milanese noble, invaded the duchy of Milan from West, in the meanwhile, a Venetian army attacked from East. Town after town surrendered and the Milanese armies disappeared. As soon as a revolt broke out in Milan, Ludovico left the city together with his family and his treasure. By September 1499 the French troops made their entrance in Milan warmly welcome by the population.

They ordered an secret embassy sent to the Mameluk Sultan to try and negotiate that duties on spices and Indian goods be lowered to make the Venetians competitive with the Portuguese. When the Sultan refused they then agreed to supply the timber for the fleet that the Sultan wanted to build to fight the Portuguese. Disappointingly much of the convoy carrying the timber was captured by the Knights Hospitaller or lost in a storm enroute.

Since XIIth century plain water-courses were embanked in order to limit the erosion and the consequent transport of sediments to the lagoon, but these works did not bring the expected results and it was therefore decided to face the problem radically deflecting the rivers that flew into the lagoon. In 1501 for that particular purpose the High Council formed a committee of three 'Savi alle Acque' (The Water Supervisors). Starting from 1551 the first river to be deflected was the Brenta, then the Bacchiglione, the Piave, the Sile, the Adige and even the Po River, all of them potentially dangerous to the status quo of the lagoon. During the next two centuries to some extent all these rivers were deflected from their old courses to the seaside, outside the lagoon. The silting up of the lagoon was actually slowed down, but at the same time both the erosion and the withdrawing of the salt-marshes increased.

	#-#Venice, shorn suddenly of her commercial hegemony, bereft of friends or allies, under continual and increasing threat from the Turks in the East and the princes of Europe in the West, it seemed to her that her only long-term hope of survival lay in building up a broad mainland bulwark. Thus, when the dispossessed lords of cities that had fallen to Cesare Borgia sought refuge in Venetian territory, she had immediately offered them sympathy and shelter. And when, seeing Cesare facing a crisis in his fortunes, these nobles made determined and more or less simultaneous bids to reinstate themselves, she gave them her active support - always provided that they would accept her as their overlord and govern in her name. By the end of 1503 the banner of St Mark was already floating over Russi and Forlimpopoli, Rimini, Cervia, and Faenza. - John Norwich, A History of Venice, New York, 1989. Taking possession of Rimini, Faenza, and a number of other cities, Venice strengthened her position below the Po River where the city of Ravenna worked as strategic outpost since 1431. But Julius II, having secured his own control of the Papal armies by arresting and imprisoning il Valentino, quickly moved to re-establish Papal control over the Romagna (since it was amongst the territories ceded to the Holy See by Pepin III in 752 in what constituted the original Papal States) by demanding that Venice return the cities she had seized. Venice refused to surrender the cities, although willing to acknowledge Papal sovereignty over them and pay an annual tribute to the Holy See. After having unsuccessfully induced Venice to abandon Romagna by means of a Papal bull, the resolute Julius II began to look for allies. Only in September 1504 at Blois where Louis XII of France stipulated a treaty with which he renounced his claims over Naples in favour of Spain for the investiture of the Duchy of Milan, at the presence of the Emperor and the Archduke of Burgundy Philippe le Beau, the Pope let them include a secret paragraph by which the signatories would have allied against Venice. In facts Julius II did not possess sufficient forces to fight Venice even if for the next two years he recovered a few small towns in Romagna and managed to bring under Papal rule, Bologna and Perugia, both only nominally subject to the church and also to re-establish the order in Rome by means of political marriages between his family, the Della Rovere, and the rival factions of Colonna and Orsini.

	#-#Since 1495, Venice had been holding the main ports of Apulia despite Aragonese claims to have them back. With the French invasion of Milan, Venice had acquired Milanese territories east of the Adda River, and upon the fall of Cesare Borgia had also acquired Rimini, Faenza and Ravenna, against the will of Pope Julius II. The Venetians also held Veneto and Friuli, on which Maximilian of Habsburg had imperial claims. In late 1507 Maximilian announced his intention to travel to Italy to receive the imperial investiture from the Pope himself, and in early 1508 he assembled a big army to escort him down to Rome. He requested free passage through Venetian territories, but was told that he would be allowed passage only without his army. Enraged at the answer, Maximilian attacked Venice, but this decision proved unwise: Venice not only routed the imperial army but also seized the imperial cities of Trieste, Gorz and Fiume. A second assault by a Tyrolean force several weeks later was an even greater failure, forcing Maximilian to conclude a humiliating three-year truce. With Pope Julius II's assent, Maximilian took the title of 'Emperor-elect', thus breaking the century-old custom that the Holy Roman Emperor had to be crowned by the Pope. Shortly afterward, Venice provided a pretext for war by appointing her own candidate to the vacant bishopric of Vicenza. The Emperor, the King of France and Ferdinand of Aragon gathered in Cambrai in December 1508 to sign a treaty which seemed to be a defensive alliance against the Turk. In reality they meant to form a league to attack Venice and deprive the Serenissima of most of her mainland territories. Pope Julius II, after a renewed Venetian refusal to give the Romagna lands back to the Papacy, ratified the treaty and at the same time proceeded to excommunicate all Venetian citizens. Ferrara and Mantua, each with separate claims to territories held by Venice, joined the league as well. In April 1509 military operations started, and a month later French troops decimated one of the two Venetian armies at the battle of Agnadello. Even though in August 1509 Venice managed to eliminate Mantua from the war, she still faced the collapse of her strategic position and had by February 24, 1510 to accept the papal demands on the cities she had occupied in Romagna. However, Pope Julius II was still not satisfied and demanded that the war be prosecuted until Venice conceded control over their church to the Pope and compensated him for his expenses. The Council of Ten had privately resolved that the terms had been accepted under duress and were therefore invalid, and that Venice should violate them at the earliest opportunity. This opportunity presented itself shortly afterward.

Conditions were hard for Venice, the Republic had to renounce her traditional power to appoint bishops as well as all jurisdiction over Papal subjects in Venetian territory and was to compensate Pope Julius II for his war expenses needed to recapture the Papal holdings in Romagna, while the Pope accepted the humble request of the Republic for pardon, cancelling the interdict. But the reconciliation between Venice and the Pope did not stop the French to continue the war against Venice with attacks to her cities in Terraferma. Julius II, in the meanwhile, had become increasingly concerned by the growing French presence in Italy and formulated plans, both to chase the French out of the Po Valley and to seize the Duchy of Ferrara, a French ally, with the intention to add the territories of Modena, Reggio and Ferrara to the Papal States. In realizing his plan the Pope immediately excommunicated Alfonso d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, declaring his fief forfeited for his remaining loyal to France, then he gained the military support of Venice, eager to recover her territories lost to the French a armies and hired an army of Swiss mercenaries to attack Milan as to isolate the French armies in Italy. However his plans failed as the French army managed to invade Romagna and occupy the cities of Bologna and Ravenna, supported by the powerful and celebrated artillery of Duke Alfonso d'Este. In addition, in response to Pope's switching sides, Louis XII of France convoked a Schismatic Council at Pisa as to have the 'Warrior Pope' deposed. Pope Julius II, having unsuccessfully pressed the Republic of Florence to refuse hosting the schismatic cardinals, proclaimed the Holy League against France and convoked a Council of his own to meet at the Lateran in Rome. The promise of territorial gains at French expense caused Ferdinand II of Aragon and Emperor Maximilian I to abandon their alliance with the French, and in October 1511, they joined the newly-formed Holy League together with Julius II and the Republic of Venice. In November, Henry VIII of England and the Swiss confederation joined as well.

	#-#In spite of their victories in Northern Italy, the French troops were forced to abandon the battlefield both because of financial reasons and because after the successful battle of Ravenna the Emperor was withdrawing troops and would have joined the holy league formed by Papal States, Spain, England and Venice with the help of Swiss troops hired by Pope Julius II himself and led into war by the Bishop of Sion, Mathias Schiner. Thence the decision to withdraw from Milan. Julius II recovered Ravenna, Bologna and the rest of the Romagna, while his commander, the Duke of Urbino, easily occupied Reggio and Modena, though Alfonso d'Este refused any settlement that would deprive him of Ferrara. After having chased out the French from Italy, the congress of allies which met at Mantua in August made over to the Pope Parma and Piacenza, to which he had at best a shadowy claim. The Emperor and Fernando would have been glad to give Milan to their grandson Charles but the Swiss were in possession and, supported by the Pope, made their will good. The duchy was given to Ercole Massimiliano Sforza, the elder son of Ludovico. The Venetian claims were left unsettled with Brescia still held out and the Swiss claiming Cremona and the Ghiara d'Adda for the duchy. And more, the Emperor demanded Vicenza and Verona. Florence, who in 1509 had ended her long war by the recovery of Pisa, was punished for her support of France by the restoration of the Medici. Entering Milan, Ercole Massimiliano Sforza received the keys to the city from the Swiss soldiers, who promised to protect the duchy of Milan and to help the Duke in sending to him all the troops he would need. The Duke granted them the acquisition of the ducal territories Ticino and Valtellina, the most important accesses to the Alpine passes. Genoa drew back its allegiance to the French King, who in 1506 harshly repressed a local rebellion that broke out owing to the decision taken by the French governor to grant privileges to the nobilty. But Julius II made also a treaty with his late ally, Maximilian, against Venice. The emperor was to support the Lateran council to oppose that one proclaimed by Louis XII in Pisa and to hand over Modena to the Pope, while Julius II was to join in compelling Venice to give up the fiefs which the Emperor claimed since Cambrai and to use on behalf of his new ally also the always convincing 'spiritual weapons'. When this treaty was made public, it had only the effect to drive Venice to side with France.

	#-#Around X century the Jews who came to Venice were usually merchants and moneylenders. Until the end of XIII century they weren't even allowed to settle in the city with the exception of the island of Spinalunga, later known as Giudecca. In 1394 only the Jews who were not moneylenders were allowed to remain in the city, the others were expelled. However they were forced to certain restrictions, like wearing various markings on their clothing to identify themselves as Jews (generally yellow badges or hats, changed in red in 1500). Jews weren't allowed to own lands and build synagogues, they were even forced to attend Christian services or become baptized and often subjet to anti-Jewish aggressions. Following the expulsion from Spain and Portugal in 1492 lots of Jewish immigrants came to Venice and decisions had to be taken about whether Jews should be allowed to remain in the city. On 29 March 1516 the Council of Ten decreed to let the Jews remain, however their residence would be confined to Ghetto Nuovo (New Ghetto), a small, dirty island of Cannaregio sestiere (a quartier in Venice) named after the Venetian word 'Gheto' meaning 'casting' for the iron foundries located there in those centuries and pronunced with a hard 'g' by the German Jews, who first settled there. The area was then isolated by wide surrounding canals and linked to the rest of the city by means of two bridges, which were closed by Christian guards at night and during certain Christian festivals, when all Jews were required to stay away. In Venice Jews were only permitted to work at pawn shops, act as moneylenders, trade in second hand goods or practice medicine and in order to leave the Ghetto at day they had to wear distinguishing marks or hats. In 1541, Jewish immigrations from the Levant, Spain and Portugal increased the population of the Ghetto so that, even if many six-story 'skyscrapers' had been built because of the lack of space, the quarter was enlarged to the neighbouring area, the Ghetto Vecchio (Old Ghetto). Despite the poor living conditions, Jewish community life in the Ghettp continued to grow, centered around Jewish rituals, customs and celebrations in synagogues built on buildings' top floors in respect of local laws which forbade synagogues in separate buildings. After 1630, when the Jewish population of Venice reached 5,000 inhabitants, the Ghetto's boundaries extended to the Ghetto Nuovissimo.

Worse than that, Venetian trade was now in the hands of the Ottomans, that periodically attacked Venice depriving her from her most precious possessions. In the war of 1463-1479 Venice lost Scodra, Kroja, Negroponte and Lemnos. In the war of 1499-1503 Venice lost Modon, Coron, Lepanto, Navarino, and Durazzo. The fall of Egypt has brought a new source of conflict. When the Venetians managed to get control of Cyprus, they offered to continue paying a tribute to the Mamluk Bey, theoretical suzerain of the island, to maintain privileged commercial relations with Egypt. It was a mistake, as now the Sultan of the Ottomans claims lordship over Cyprus and requests that the tribute is paid to him in gold instead of cloths as we used to do. Venice accepted to pay, but dispatched Giovanni Sammichele and Giulio Savorgnan, his best military engineers, to strengthen the fortifications at Cyprus, knowing that the Turks would eventually attack the island.

Classified as a true broadsword this war sword had a wider blade than its contemporary infantry rapiers. The Schiavona was basket hilted and double edged. During the 17th century, due to the trade with northern Italy, the Schiavona won a huge popularity in all other European armies. Later fitted with a long blade, it became the favourite sword of all the heavy cavalry.

	#-#Antonio Pigafetta belonged to a rich family of Vicenza. In his youth he studied astronomy, geography and cartography. He served on board the galleys of the order of St. John at the beginning of 16th century. In 1519 he accompanied the Papal Nuncio, Monsignor Chieregati, to Spain where he was presented to the Emperor Carlos I (V). There he heard of the trip of Magellan and negotiated to be admitted as a paying passenger, a supernumerary. In spite of initial difficulties with Magellan, he managed to gain his confidence and served as a chronicler and cartographer for him. During the trip, Pigafetta collected information about geography, the climate, the flora, the fauna and the inhabitants of the visited places. His meticulous notes were to serve as invaluable documents to future explorers and cartographers, mainly due to their focus on nautical and linguistic data. In the battle at Mactan, Philippines, in which Magellan was killed, Pigafetta also was hurt. Nevertheless, he managed to recover and was among the 18 on board the Victoria who accompanied Juan Sebastián Elcano in his return to Spain. After reaching port in Sanlúcar de Barrameda (Cadiz) in September of 1522, three years after his departure, he recollected his experiences in 'Relations of the First Round-the-world Trip', composed in Italian and published in Venice. After that voyage Pigafetta returned to Italy where he died in his native city in 1534.

Princes and ambassadors of all Italian states came to this encounter with the intention to confirm their allegiance to the Empire. Charles V used his strengthened political influence to definitely settle the Italian balance of powers and the conflicts between the Italian minors that deceitfully used to switch sides between France and the Empire. According to Mercurino da Gattinara's advices Charles V granted independence to all the imperial fiefs and, with the mediation of Pope Clemens VII, even to Francesco Sforza who was reinstated in his duchy in spite of his joining the league of Cognac. Pope Clemens VII instead, receiving the territory of Parma was to renounce his claims to Modena and Ferrara and to promise to arrange for a Concile in the next future to discuss about the Reform of the Church. Settled the political affairs in the peninsula, Charles was crowned by Pope Clement VII King of Italy on 22 February 1530 and Holy Roman Emperor two day later, in two solemn ceremonies arranged in Bologna. The imperial crown was a really big gift for his 30th birthday: Charles V resulted, in facts, the last Holy Roman Emperor in history to be personally crowned by the Pope.

His largest project for Venice was Fortezza di Sant'Andrea (1545), defending the Lido entrance to the Venetian lagoon. In visiting Cyprus and Crete for the Serenissima Sanmicheli is probably the only practicing Italian architect of the sixteenth century to have had the opportunity to see Greek architecture, a possible source for his use of Roman Doric columns without bases. It was in the military field that Sanmicheli's career was first influenced by the Cornaro family. Girolamo Cornaro, then newly installed as Capitano (military commander) at Padua, encountered Sanmicheli in 1538 as architect for the famous fortification there that became known as Bastion Cornaro. In the following year he also commissioned Sanmicheli to design a new palace, Villa Cornaro. Later, Girolamo's brother Giovanni Cornaro commissioned Sanmicheli to design a new atrium for Ca' Lando-Cornaro (later known as Ca' Cornaro-Spinelli) on the Grand Canal in Venice. The Sanmicheli designed Ca' Cornaro was constructed in 1555. The second great Venetian palazzo designed by Sanmicheli was Ca' Grimani, constructed on the Grand Canal in the late 1550s for the late Doge Grimani family. Sanmicheli outlined his ideas on classical architecture in a book titled, The Five Orders of Architecture. He closed his career with the design of the circular Church of the Madonna di Campagna near Verona, 1559.

They were made slim to maneuver the narrowest canals and topped with 'felzi', small cabins that allowed to travel incognito. Originally the color of gondolas wasn't regulated, though they were predominantly black from the pitch used to keep them water tight. When in the XVIth century private boats started to become exceptionally lavish and larger as much as to block circulation, sumptuary laws were enacted mandating that they be the uniform black and sized 11m x 1,75m x 70 Kgs.

For his phenomenal energy in painting he was termed Il Furioso, the furious, and his dramatic use of perspectival space and special lighting effects make him a precursor of baroque art.

As time passed, many bridges were constructed in Venice, but none connecting the banks of the Grand Canal. This was a rather big problem for the city, and the population would always tease the High Council about it. To prevent the humiliation, a wooden bridge across the Grand Canal was set up in Rialto, in the heart of Venice, named La Pónt. However, upkeep costs were high due to frequent restorations of the partially submerged, rapidly rotting, and in 1524 collapsed La Pónt. To solve this problem the High Council decided to call in some of the best architects in all of Italy: Andrea Palladio and Vincenzo Scamozzi. Both architects presented drawings of a bridge featuring three great arches, all ending in the centre of the bridge, where a kettledrum sustained by huge columns was to be installed. In spite of the great fame of both architects and the magnificence of their plans a project by Antonio da Ponte would win. His suggestion was a unique arch bridge, 48 meters long, 22 meters wide, and high enough to allow boats to pass under, and it was immediately chosen, discarding Palladio's majestic project. Construction was started in 1588, and it took some years to finally join the opposite parts of the Grand Canal, finally replacing La Pónt, who would only live on in Vittore Carpaccio's famous painting 'The Healing of the Obsessed'.

In 1613 Monteverdi was appointed 'maestro di cappella' at St. Mark's, Venice. Monteverdi can be justly considered one of the most powerful figures in the history of music.

	#-#During 1615, Doge Giovanni Bembo, hero of Lepanto, initiated an agressive policy against the Austrian Habsburgs in the war of Gradisca (Uskok war), and supported Savoy in her fights with the Spanish Habsburgs in Milan. The Spanish reprisal was the authorization to the Duke of Osuna, Viceroy of Naples, to attack Venice in the Adriatic with his private fleet under his own banner during the 1617 season. Venice protested these attacks, but the King of Spain privately supported Osuna despite his public repudiation. In November 1617 the peace between Austria and Venice was signed in Madrid, and although Gradisca remained in Austrian hands, the Uskok problem was solved. Then, right after the deaths of Doge Bembo and his successor in two months, in May 1618 the Council of Ten ordered the execution of 300 French and Spaniards working for Venice at the Arsenal. Venice was shaken by the bloodiest incident in her history, and a rumor started that a great danger had been avoided. Although no solid evidence was provided, the Signoria claimed that Osuna had tried to take over the city from the inside, but that the plot had been uncovered by one of the implicated. Amidst public outcry, the Spanish ambassador, the Marquis of Bedmar, had to leave Venice, while one of Osuna's agents, the immortal writer Francisco de Quevedo, narrowly escaped death. Some Venetian nobles were exiled. Wether the conspiracy was such, or some covert operation aborted is still debated. Osuna fell out of favour a couple of years later, and was recalled to Spain to die in 1624 in confinment without judgement, while Venice initiated a more peaceful period.

On October 27, Zen caused an uproar at a meeting of the Great Council by accusing the Cornaro family of corruption; although the elections were annulled, he was unable to obtain any further sanctions. On December 30, Renier Zen was attacked by masked assassins, who were later found to include Giorgio Cornaro, the son of the Doge. Zen grew even more outspoken in his criticism of Cornaro in the wake of Giorgio Cornaro's failed assassination attempt. Venice now became divided into two factions, a pro-Conaro faction that was pro-papal and backed by the Venetian oligarchs, and a pro-Zen faction that was anti-papal and backed by the poorer nobility. Rioting broke out between the two factions on July 23, 1628, and for the rest of Cornaro's life, Venice was locked in a civil war. The Venetian government had basically broken down by late 1628.

In the end the High Council realised that prohibition was not the best way to act and decided to at least reap some benefit from the situation: in 1638 the first public gambling house was thus opened. This was the 'Ridotto' in Palazzo Dandolo near San Moisè, just a few steps from St Marks Square and from the southern access to the Grand Canal.

After a crushing the Papal Army at Lagoscuro in 1644 the ban was lifted and Farnese compelled to continue repaying his debt. The conflict was renewed in 1649 by Odoardo's successor Ranuccio II who discontinued the payments rendered by his father to the Roman creditors.

The Ottomans ceded most of Hungary, Transylvania and Slavonia to Austria while Podolia returned to Poland. Most of Dalmatia passed to Venice, along with the Morea (the Peloponnesus peninsula). The Treaty of Karlowitz marked the beginning of the Ottoman decline in Eastern Europe, and made the Habsburg Monarchy the dominant power in Central Europe.

In 1738 the Republic of Venice realised along the littorals of Malamocco, Pellestrina and Sottomarina the so-called 'Murazzi': sea defensive works made up of Istrian stone and 'pozzolana'. They were jetties whose aim was to create a barrier to prevent the sea from attacking and eroding the banks. The idea of building these defensive works was conceived in 1716 by Father Vincenzo Coronelli. He sent the 'Savii d'acue' ('Savi alle Acque' in Italian), main office in charge of civilian public works, his innovative project, in which he proposed to substitute the traditional sea defensive works made up of oak trunks and filling material with a real staircase made up of Istrian stone blocks. But it was the Water, Rivers, and Lagoon supervisor Bernardino Zendrini who carried out this project thanks to the employ of 'pozzolana', a recently discovered material which solidifies when it is mixed to lime and if it comes in touch with water. This way the Istrian stone blocks welded with each other and made the 'Murazzi' barrier even more effective.

Except for the croupiers and the Barnabots, impoverished Venetian noblemen, all visitors were obliged to wear three-cornered hats, capes and masks in order to access incognito the gambling places. The Ridotto was open to the public only during carnival, which could often last six months in Venice, from October to February-March. In 1774, because of many concerns about frequent nobles' gambling problems the High Council voted on a motion aiming at 'the preservation of piety, sound discipline and moderate behaviour' and the Ridotto was definitively closed. The city stood terribly shocked with great damage to the profits of pimps, usurers, hosts, shop-keepers, mask-makers and Barnabot noblemen.

But Emo realising that decay had set in with Venetian shipping since 1720, convened a conference in 1775 in upgrading the naval arm similar to that of England's. During the next decade, Angelo Emo reorganised the extensive dockyard of the Republic, he occupied the highest posts in the Magistracy and redirected money that was to be used for defensive maintenance. Soon after, he was once more engaged to suppress the rising power of the Barbary corsairs. Eventually, the Venetian Republic declared war on the Bey of Tunis and, on 27 June 1784, the newly built fleet sailed down the Adriatic under the supreme command of Emo. Between October 1784 and October 1786 the Venetian fleet bombarded and razed to the ground Tunis and La Goletta, Susa, Sfax and Bizerta. Highly effective during this operation were the floating batteries which could move close to the target, and which were of Emo's own invention. As a result of this campaign, the freedom of trade in the Mediterranean was assured, and by his military successes the Venetian admiral consolidated his honoured place in the annals of the Republic that gave him birth.

His first operas to win international acclaim come from 1813, written for different Venetian theatres: the serious 'Tancredi' and the comic 'L'italiana in Algieri', the one showing a fusion of lyrical expression and dramatic needs, with its crystalline melodies, arresting harmonic inflections and colourful orchestral writing, the other moving easily between the sentimental, the patriotic, the absurd and the sheer lunatic. In 1815 Rossini went to Naples as musical and artistic director of the Teatro San Carlo, which led to a concentration on serious opera.

In the XVIIth century the population of Crete was divided into four tiers, the Venetian noble families, the Cretan noble families, the citizens of the three main towns of Candia, La Canea and Rettimo and the rest of the population.
