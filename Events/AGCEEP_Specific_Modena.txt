Francesco Sforza, ruler of Milan and Venice, the chief state of the league confederates, who was more and more threatened by the advancing Ottomans in her eastern Mediterranean territories, convened a cease-fire while a bilateral treaty was hastily signed in Lodi on 7 April 1454. With that treaty Sforza was legitimated Duke of Milan. Without even being called for, Florence and the Pope had no choice then to endorse the treaty. The King of Naples, being a rightful claimant on the ducal throne reluctantly joined the alliance under the condition to keep Genoa out of it. Intended 'infra terminos italicos', that treaty showed the objective impossibility for all the Italian major powers (specifically Milan, Tuscany, Venice, Naples and Papal States) to prevail upon each other in the struggle for the hegemony in Italy and that the better solution was to come to terms with each other. That would have also avoided the practice of very expensive and pointless wars in the next future. Although the treaty actually played a minor part in Italian balance of powers and so won't be able to avoid future wars of aggression from inside as well from outside Italy, the post-Lodi era historically represented a period of relative peace in which the figurative arts definitively flourished in the whole Italian peninsula, as well as economy and trade and, last but not the least, the skills and tricks of the art of diplomacy.

	#-#Since 1495, Venice had been holding the main ports of Apulia despite Aragonese claims to have them back. With the French invasion of Milan, Venice had acquired Milanese territories east of the Adda River, and upon the fall of Cesare Borgia had also acquired Rimini, Faenza and Ravenna, against the will of Pope Julius II. The Venetians also held Veneto and Friuli, on which Maximilian of Habsburg had imperial claims. In late 1507 Maximilian announced his intention to travel to Italy to receive the imperial investiture from the Pope himself, and in early 1508 he assembled a big army to escort him down to Rome. He requested free passage through Venetian territories, but was told that he would be allowed passage only without his army. Enraged at the answer, Maximilian attacked Venice, but this decision proved unwise: Venice not only routed the imperial army but also seized the imperial cities of Trieste, Gorz and Fiume. A second assault by a Tyrolean force several weeks later was an even greater failure, forcing Maximilian to conclude a humiliating three-year truce. With Pope Julius II's assent, Maximilian took the title of 'Emperor-elect', thus breaking the century-old custom that the Holy Roman Emperor had to be crowned by the Pope. Shortly afterward, Venice provided a pretext for war by appointing her own candidate to the vacant bishopric of Vicenza. The Emperor, the King of France and Ferdinand of Aragon gathered in Cambrai in December 1508 to sign a treaty which seemed to be a defensive alliance against the Turk. In reality they meant to form a league to attack Venice and deprive the Serenissima of most of her mainland territories. Pope Julius II, after a renewed Venetian refusal to give the Romagna lands back to the Papacy, ratified the treaty and at the same time proceeded to excommunicate all Venetian citizens. Ferrara and Mantua, each with separate claims to territories held by Venice, joined the league as well. In April 1509 military operations started, and a month later French troops decimated one of the two Venetian armies at the battle of Agnadello. Even though in August 1509 Venice managed to eliminate Mantua from the war, she still faced the collapse of her strategic position and had by February 24, 1510 to accept the papal demands on the cities she had occupied in Romagna. However, Pope Julius II was still not satisfied and demanded that the war be prosecuted until Venice conceded control over their church to the Pope and compensated him for his expenses. The Council of Ten had privately resolved that the terms had been accepted under duress and were therefore invalid, and that Venice should violate them at the earliest opportunity. This opportunity presented itself shortly afterward.

But the reconciliation between Venice and the Pope did not stop the French to continue the war against Venice with attacks to her cities in Terraferma. Julius II, in the meanwhile, had become increasingly concerned by the growing French presence in Italy and formulated plans, both to chase the French out of the Po Valley and to seize the Duchy of Ferrara, a French ally, with the intention to add the territories of Modena, Reggio and Ferrara to the Papal States. In realizing his plan the Pope immediately excommunicated Alfonso d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, declaring his fief forfeited for his remaining loyal to France, then he gained the military support of Venice, eager to recover her territories lost to the French a armies and hired an army of Swiss mercenaries to attack Milan as to isolate the French armies in Italy. However his plans failed as the French army managed to invade Romagna and occupy the cities of Bologna and Ravenna, supported by the powerful and celebrated artillery of Duke Alfonso d'Este. In addition, in response to Pope's switching sides, Louis XII of France convoked a Schismatic Council at Pisa as to have the 'Warrior Pope' deposed. Pope Julius II, having unsuccessfully pressed the Republic of Florence to refuse hosting the schismatic cardinals, proclaimed the Holy League against France and convoked a Council of his own to meet at the Lateran in Rome. The promise of territorial gains at French expense caused Ferdinand II of Aragon and Emperor Maximilian I to abandon their alliance with the French, and in October 1511, they joined the newly-formed Holy League together with Julius II and the Republic of Venice. In November, Henry VIII of England and the Swiss confederation joined as well.

	#-#An epic poem by Ludovico Ariosto (1474-1533), it was dedicated to his patron Cardinal Ippolito d'Este. An extension of Matteo Maria Boiardo's 'Orlando Innamorato' the piece followed Duke Namo's defeat in Charlemagne's war where Angelica escapes to find Rinaldo, who sought his horse Bayardo. She evades Rinaldo and meets Ferrau. Rinaldo and Ferrau fight, then make a truce and share a horse to seek Angelica. Ferrau seeks his helmet and encounters the ghost of Angelica. She flees and falls asleep in a grove until awakened by a lamenting knight, Sacripante. Angelica manipulates Sacripante while he tries to seduce her. Angelica and the embarrassed Sacripante share her horse and encounter Bayardo. Noted for its many allegories and metaphors, it illustrated the fallacy of human sense and judgement over the ideals of knight errantry. Widely popular it became the basis of several Baroque operas by Antonio Vivaldi and George Frideric Handel.

Subsequently the Duke procured their dismissal by direct and indirect means. Relations were further soured with allegations of Renee's Protestant leanings (starting with a visit from John Calvin). In collusion with the Papal Curia and its Inquisition, the Duchess was arrested and made to repent (1554). However she returned to her Protestant faith after Ercole's death (1559) and was known to offer protection to her brethren on her French estates.

Viewed as 'an extraordinary and novel phenomnenon' the 'Concerto delle donne' revolutionised the role of women in music - sparking a series of imitators throughout Italy. Considered the most important achievement in XVI century Italian secular music, the innovations adapted by this group would contribute to the development of the madrigal and seconda pratica.

The conflict was renewed in 1649 by Odoardo's successor Ranuccio II who discontinued the payments rendered by his father to the Roman creditors.

	#-#Under Francesco III (r.1737-80) and Ercole III (r.1780-97) Modena underwent much urban renovation. The father introduced numeration to housing, engaged in public works (in particular the 'Via Vandelli' that connected Modena to Tuscany) and revised the law. Ercole continued his work by contructing bridges at Rubiera and St.Ambrogio along the Via Emilia and more road works connecting Modena to its neighbours. In 1785 he founded the Atestina Academy of Fine Arts which encouraged artistic and cultural development - discovering the likes of Lazzaro Spallanzani, Gaimbattista Venturi, Girolamo Tiraboschi and Lodovico Ricci.
