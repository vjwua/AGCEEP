Holland, which was ruled by the Bavarian House by now, tried to get hold of Friesland and Groningen. The Bishop of Utrecht tried to effectuate his rights on Groningen and Drente. And a powerfull count in Oost-Friesland tried to conquer the Ommelanden. In the end all these attacks were repulsed, and Groningen became effectively an independent citystate. She had direct rule over the Gorecht and the Oldambts, and a strong treaty with the Ommelanden that gave her political and economic preponderance. Westerwolde was in pledge from the Bishop of Munster, and she had garrisons along the Eastern border. Large parts of Friesland were subordinate to her and in several cities in Friesland she had blockhouses with garrisons. Her coat of arms was a double imperial eagle, sign of an free imperial city. The sovereignty of the Bishop had become a hollow formality. In 1490, Groningen lost its major seaport of Delfzijl, this loss slowly ebbed the demise as Emden which lies on the opposite side of the river gained in precedence, Emden was now controlled by the Cirksena dynasty, counts of east Frisia.
