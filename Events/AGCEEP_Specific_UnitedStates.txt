The following year, in a situation of internal conflicts between 'Patriots', rebels arranged in a local militia, and English regular troops, a Second Continental Congress was convened in Philadelphia, on 10 May 1775, with the participation of representatives of 13 colonies. Decisions were made about the creation of a Continental Army under the command of a Virginian planter, George Washington, to oppose the British and about signing a petition (Olive Branch Petition) to be extended to the crown and assure the King of England of the loyalty of the British American colonists, who were asking for reconciliation and resignation of His Majesty's ministers, clearly unable to meet their requests. But news of the English army successfully repressing the rebels in America came to Britain together with that petition so that the King firmly refused to intercede and redress colonial grievances. He issued the 'Proclamation for Suppressing Rebellion and Sedition' declaring elements of the American colonies in a state of open and avowed rebellion. There would be no negotiations whatsoever until the stipulation of the Treaty of Paris in 1783, with which England would formally recognize the independence of the Thirteen United States of America.

	#-#Campaign and the Issues, 1812: The War of 1812 dominated the campaign. Because the United States suffered early defeats in the West, DeWitt Clinton's supporters blasted the president for incompetence in directing the war effort, a war that Federalists denounced as groundless. Madison's campaigners defended the war as necessary to establish American neutral rights. Madison was not that popular, but two things turned against Clinton. First, Clinton tried to appeal to hawks and doves alike making his position non-credible. Second, Madison was a president at war and people rallied to his defense. Electoral Votes: Madison 128, Clinton 89. How will the Spirit of America choose this time?

	#-#Campaign and the Issues, 1816: There were no big issues. James Monroe was supported by two popular former presidents, Jefferson and Madison, and Monroe was a skilled tactician doing very little campaigning. The election was a sure thing all from the beginning as there were in fact only one efficient party, the Republicans. The Federalists existed, but was trashed from opposing the War of 1812 and had its voters in the New England area. Its organization and form was old and obsolete and it did not even officially nominate a candidate. It though supported Rufus King who put up only token opposition against the republican juggernaut. The Republicans was on the other hand an all-American movement with strong bases in New York, Virginia and in the South from which it campaign with skill and effect. Four republican presidential terms in a row had strengthened the party proportionally to the decline of the Federalists. James Monroe won a walk-over even if it was not as superior as his victory in 1820 where he grabbed all electors but one. Electoral Votes: Monroe 183, King 34.

To root out the problem General Andrew Jackson burnt villages and overthrew the Spanish governor. This episode convinced the Spanish government that the United States was capable of seizing Florida at will. This belief grew so strong that the Spanish government offered Florida to the United Sates for a lump sum of money. The agreement was finalized by U.S. Secretary of State John Quincy Adams and Spanish Minister Luis de Onís. Mr. President, we will get Florida for a lump sum of 500 ducats should we heed the offer?
