He wanted to take control of Naples immediately without waiting for the Queen's death. He soon imprisoned Caracciolo, Giovanna's lover, but he failed to capture the Queen. Muzio Attendolo Sforza, the Neapolitan condottiero in the service of the Pope, informed that Giovanna was in great danger, went hastily to Naples and rescued her. It was then easy for the Pope to convince the Queen to adopt Louis III of Anjou, Count of Provence, instead of Alfons of Aragon. Taking advantage of the absence of Alfons due to his problems in Aragon, and with the military help of Visconti, Duke of Milan and Signore of Genoa, the Aragonese were expelled from Naples, and Giovanna appointed Louis as Duke of Calabria, the heir's title. Louis moved his court to Cosenza to arrange his stay in Italy.

	#-#Since the middle of the fourteenth century, Corsica had been divided into three political entities. In the South, Dilà dei Monti (Beyond the Mountains) was the Terra di'Signori, the Land of the Lords held by feudal dynasties. The five most important were all issued from the same ancestor: Arrigu di Cinarca. The di Leca, the della Rocca, the d'Istria, the d'Ornanu and the di Bozzi kept fighting each other all the time, and alliances and truces between them were broken as easily as they were made. Having their support was essential for a foreign power trying to control this part of the island so they often found themselves supported in their petty strives by Pisa, Genoa or Aragon. Two of the Cinarchesi only managed to unite the whole Dilà under their rule. The first one had been Sinucellu Ghjudice di Cinarca (1219-1307) before dying in a Genoese cell. The second one was Vincentellu d'Istria appointed as a Viceroy by Alfons V of Aragon in 1416. In the North, Diquà dei Monti (Beneath the Mountains) was the Terra di U Cumunu, the Land of the Communes held by villagers' communities led by magistrates and making their own laws though they most often paid taxes to some higher authority. The original organization was kind of democratic but the powerful local families soon took the habit to manipulate the electoral system to keep the important positions between themselves. Some of them had been, or later would be, ennoblished by Genoa and frequent marriages occured between the d'Omessa, the della Casabianca, the di Matra, the di Casta and many others, and the Cinarchese or the Capicorsi lords. They were also merchant families who asked for peace and order before anything else and were ready to submit to whomever was insuring those, be they Pisan or Genoese Republics, or Aragonese Viceroy. In the Capicorsu, the Corsican Cape being the northernmost tip of the island, Genoese noble families had settled during the tweltfh and thirteenth centuries. Although they might be considered as Corsican more than a century later, the da Mare and the de Gentile still had strong ties with their branches which had remained in Genoa. They always provided the best support for the Genoans in their wars on the island. Only on a few occasions, when they deemed themselves tricked or robbed by the Republic, would they attempt to rebel or join ongoing revolts.\nThe Aragonese viceroy, Vincentellu d'Istria, was captured at sea. Tried in Genoa, he was executed on 27th April 1434. Simone da Mare, a Genoese nobleman elected Count by the rebels immediately pledged fealty to the Republic of Genoa and ruled on its behalf thereafter.

Filippo Maria Visconti of Milan, also Signore of Genoa, preoccupied for the increasing Aragonese influence in the Mediterranean sea trade routes as much as in the Italian peninsula, decided to support the Angevins. Alfons of Aragon was defeated and captured by a Genovese fleet at the battle of Ponza in 1435. Transferred to Milan, Alfons succeeded in gaining Visconti's favour to his cause against the French Angevins. He convinced Filippo Maria that a French presence in Italy could be against the interests of Milan since the House of Orléans had never hidden its dynastic claims on the Duchy of Milan. But Genoa, a bitter rival of Aragon during centuries of dispute over Sardinia, Corsica, and the control of the Western Mediterranean trade, was appalled by Visconti's sudden change of sides, and immediately asked for admission in the Venetian-Florentine league against her former suzerain.

Francesco Sforza, ruler of Milan and Venice, the chief state of the league confederates, who was more and more threatened by the advancing Ottomans in her eastern Mediterranean territories, convened a cease-fire while a bilateral treaty was hastily signed in Lodi on 7 April 1454. With that treaty Sforza was legitimated Duke of Milan. Without even being called for, Florence and the Pope had no choice then to endorse the treaty. The King of Naples, being a rightful claimant on the ducal throne reluctantly joined the alliance under the condition to keep Genoa out of it. Intended 'infra terminos italicos', that treaty showed the objective impossibility for all the Italian major powers (specifically Milan, Tuscany, Venice, Naples and Papal States) to prevail upon each other in the struggle for the hegemony in Italy and that the better solution was to come to terms with each other. That would have also avoided the practice of very expensive and pointless wars in the next future. Although the treaty actually played a minor part in Italian balance of powers and so won't be able to avoid future wars of aggression from inside as well from outside Italy, the post-Lodi era historically represented a period of relative peace in which the figurative arts definitively flourished in the whole Italian peninsula, as well as economy and trade and, last but not the least, the skills and tricks of the art of diplomacy.

That provoked resentment in the brothers of the assassinated duke, also aming at the regency title, but negotiations were successfully conducted by Simonetta. If in Milan calm was restored an uprise broke in Genoa against the Milanese Governor Pallavicini led by members of the Fieschi and Campofregoso families united togetheragainst the Sforza rule. Cicco Simonetta gained the favour of Prospero Adorno, once opposer to Galeazzo's rule thus releasing him from prison, with the promise to crush the revolt and reeastablish the Milanese rule over Genoa. Adorno occupied Genoa and became Governor for Milan. But Adorno started to have contacts with the King of Naples and they represented a sign of rebellion. Battista Fregoso, member of the Campofregoso family, which gave several doges to the city, was asked to intervene in crushing the rebellion in order to restore the Sforza lordship over the Republic. Battista Fregoso managed to chase Adorno away and to proclaim himself Doge of the Republic. Milan didn't solve the problems with the administratio of Genoa as the new doge didn't seem to acknowledge Sforza's lordship over Genoa, instead he followed a policy of partnership with Milan without acknowledging the Duke as suzerain.

	#-#Since 1495, Venice had been holding the main ports of Apulia despite Aragonese claims to have them back. With the French invasion of Milan, Venice had acquired Milanese territories east of the Adda River, and upon the fall of Cesare Borgia had also acquired Rimini, Faenza and Ravenna, against the will of Pope Julius II. The Venetians also held Veneto and Friuli, on which Maximilian of Habsburg had imperial claims. In late 1507 Maximilian announced his intention to travel to Italy to receive the imperial investiture from the Pope himself, and in early 1508 he assembled a big army to escort him down to Rome. He requested free passage through Venetian territories, but was told that he would be allowed passage only without his army. Enraged at the answer, Maximilian attacked Venice, but this decision proved unwise: Venice not only routed the imperial army but also seized the imperial cities of Trieste, Gorz and Fiume. A second assault by a Tyrolean force several weeks later was an even greater failure, forcing Maximilian to conclude a humiliating three-year truce. With Pope Julius II's assent, Maximilian took the title of 'Emperor-elect', thus breaking the century-old custom that the Holy Roman Emperor had to be crowned by the Pope. Shortly afterward, Venice provided a pretext for war by appointing her own candidate to the vacant bishopric of Vicenza. The Emperor, the King of France and Ferdinand of Aragon gathered in Cambrai in December 1508 to sign a treaty which seemed to be a defensive alliance against the Turk. In reality they meant to form a league to attack Venice and deprive the Serenissima of most of her mainland territories. Pope Julius II, after a renewed Venetian refusal to give the Romagna lands back to the Papacy, ratified the treaty and at the same time proceeded to excommunicate all Venetian citizens. Ferrara and Mantua, each with separate claims to territories held by Venice, joined the league as well. In April 1509 military operations started, and a month later French troops decimated one of the two Venetian armies at the battle of Agnadello. Even though in August 1509 Venice managed to eliminate Mantua from the war, she still faced the collapse of her strategic position and had by February 24, 1510 to accept the papal demands on the cities she had occupied in Romagna. However, Pope Julius II was still not satisfied and demanded that the war be prosecuted until Venice conceded control over their church to the Pope and compensated him for his expenses. The Council of Ten had privately resolved that the terms had been accepted under duress and were therefore invalid, and that Venice should violate them at the earliest opportunity. This opportunity presented itself shortly afterward.

Thence the decision to withdraw from Milan. Julius II recovered Ravenna, Bologna and the rest of the Romagna, while his commander, the Duke of Urbino, easily occupied Reggio and Modena, though Alfonso d'Este refused any settlement that would deprive him of Ferrara. After having chased out the French from Italy, the congress of allies which met at Mantua in August made over to the Pope Parma and Piacenza, to which he had at best a shadowy claim. The Emperor and Fernando would have been glad to give Milan to their grandson Charles but the Swiss were in possession and, supported by the Pope, made their will good. The duchy was given to Ercole Massimiliano Sforza, the elder son of Ludovico. The Venetian claims were left unsettled with Brescia still held out and the Swiss claiming Cremona and the Ghiara d'Adda for the duchy. And more, the Emperor demanded Vicenza and Verona. Florence, who in 1509 had ended her long war by the recovery of Pisa, was punished for her support of France by the restoration of the Medici. Entering Milan, Ercole Massimiliano Sforza received the keys to the city from the Swiss soldiers, who promised to protect the duchy of Milan and to help the Duke in sending to him all the troops he would need. The Duke granted them the acquisition of the ducal territories Ticino and Valtellina, the most important accesses to the Alpine passes. Genoa drew back its allegiance to the French King, who in 1506 harshly repressed a local rebellion that broke out owing to the decision taken by the French governor to grant privileges to the nobilty. But Julius II made also a treaty with his late ally, Maximilian, against Venice. The emperor was to support the Lateran council to oppose that one proclaimed by Louis XII in Pisa and to hand over Modena to the Pope, while Julius II was to join in compelling Venice to give up the fiefs which the Emperor claimed since Cambrai and to use on behalf of his new ally also the always convincing 'spiritual weapons'. When this treaty was made public, it had only the effect to drive Venice to side with France.

The French prelate's men protected the fugitive and repelled the Pope's guards, twice. A strong enmity ensued between French people in Rome and Corsican Guards, culminating on 20th August 1662 when a violent brawl between Corsicans and soldiers of the French ambassador, the Duke of Créquy, took place in a tavern. In the evening, the Duke's palace was assaulted and the ambassadress's carriage was even shot at. Six men died, including a civilian who happened to belong to the Duke's household. Louis XIV reacted immediately by sending back the Nuncio from Paris, invaded the Comtat- Venaissin and asked for the Corsican Guard to be entirely disbanded and for the Corsicans to be declared unfit to serve the Papal States. Before that, fifty of its members would have to be hanged and three-hundred and fifty others sent to the galleys.\nWe have been complaining several times to the Pope about his recruiting officers helping emptying Corsica. He has just agreed to the French demands when he had been disregarding ours for many years.

This policy was pursued during the following centuries and became even more intensive after the Cinarchese Wars and the War of the French, throughout the 'Iron Century' (1569-1729). One of the most peculiar group of settlers were in fact Greeks. On January 18th 1676, an agreement was signed between the Genoese Magistrates and the leaders of a community originating from Maïna in Morea. Fleeing from the Ottomans, the Stephanopoli brothers and their people were given land in Corsica and Genoese citizenship. This made them into most faithful supporters of Genoa and as a consequence created heavy tensions with the surrounding Corsican villages so that Greek settlings were often raided by various revolters. During the Forty Years War, they even had to flee to Ajaccio for a time before being resettled by the French in Carghjese, where they still are.

The Due Seini were a very unfair tax, supposedly temporary, which had been instaured fifteen years earlier after Genoa had finally agreed to the Nobili Dodeci's longtime request to forbid firearms in Corsica. To compensate the resulting loss of income (the Republic used to sell licences for firearms) it was then decreed that every family would have to pay this new tax, which was approximatively equivalent to the licence's price. De facto, Corsicans were paying Genoa to forbid firearms, which were only needed because Genoa was not able to enforce law and order in the island.

At this time, there was already a strong party among the Corsican rebel leaders who were willing to bring Corsica under French domination, so they were quite disapointed when after a few parleys it became clear that the French troops were only acting on behalf of the Republic. De Boissieux too had learned something from these first meetings: that the Corsican rebels may give themselves to whichever power who would allow them to escape from Genoa, possibly an enemy of France. As for now, the rebels were gaining time, not daring to fight the French contingent until they were left choiceless. At the end of the year, new statutes were published, based upon the ones granted in 1733 with very few ameliorations, and of course arms would have to be surrendered. When the French troops began to move towards the interior to seize arms, the rebels were indeed left choiceless. On 13th December, the French were defeated by a large Corsican army at U Borgu and retreated towards Bastia. Reinforcements had to be sent and in the Spring of 1739 there were nearly 10000 French soldiers under the Marquis de Maillebois in Corsica. Against such a strong force, the rebels were soon militarily defeated.

	#-#In the 15th century Genoa was divided into many factions. There was a split between nobles and commoners, between he rich and poor, and between the 'Blacks' and the 'Whites', the descendants of the Guelf (papal) and Ghibelline (imperial) parties. All the important families had power bases in Genoa's many neighbourhoods. As a result there was civil strife throughout the century. Genoa's government was overthrown by force 19 times between 1419 and 1528. During Milanese and French influence, times were calmer.
