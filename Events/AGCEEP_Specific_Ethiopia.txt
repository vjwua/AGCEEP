	#-#Ethiopia was an Empire spanning a vast area populated by numerous tribal peoples that did not follow the state religion of the Empire, and few Solomonid Emperors can be considered to have controlled their whole Empire at any time. Beside the endless power struggles, religious strife and encroachments of Muslims, Ethiopian Emperors are also known for their campaigns against the followers of other religions within their Empire and on its borders.\n Yeshaq I is remembered for his campaigns against the Falashas and invasions of Shanqella region. The Falashas were (still are) Jewish Ethiopians. Their origin is still debated, whether they are a lost tribe of Israel or Ethiopians converted from an archaic form of Christianity to Judaism. In any case they constituted a likely target to the beleaguered Orthodox Christians surrounded by Islam. The continuous campaigns against the Falashas were successful in greatly reducing their numbers. Shanqella is an inhospitable region in western Ethiopia inhabited by black-skinned pagans of Sudanese origin. With its backwards and disorganized inhabitants, this region was a frequent proving and raiding ground of Ethiopian Emperors.

They were helped by the mountainous topography of their country and by the fact that none of their Muslim neighbours was specially powerful. However over the centuries, Muslim faith had infiltrated Ethiopia to the point that seven of its Kingdoms had become Muslim: Ifat, Dawaro, Arbabini, Hadiya, Shakara, Bale and Dara. With the rise in power of Adal, Ethiopia became subject to periodic invasions, that were made extremely dangerous because many Muslim Ethiopians would side with the invader. That was the case of sultan Shihab Badlay, known as the Beast (Awen) Badlay, who in one campaing wrestled Bale from Ethiopia, and in another tried to do the same with Dawaro. Zara Yaqob met the challenge, and at the battle of Gomit it is told that he trespassed Badlay's neck with his lance. He then ordered his foe's body cut in pieces that he sent to all the cities in the Kingdom. With the recovery of Bale, and the crushing of Adal and her allies, Ethiopia had bough time.

He was far removed from the throne, but the death of several of his half-brothers and one of his nephews left him as the best candidate, since the inheritance to the throne of Solomon does not follow a strict rule, and the heir can be chosen between all the descendants of the late Emperor. Upon ascending to the throne in 1434, according to tradition the prince chose a new name as emperor, Kwestantinos, in imitation of the Byzantine emperor. Two years later he was crowned and consacrated at Aksum, the old capital, as Neguse Negest (King of Kings, or Emperor), receiving also his throne name, Amda Seyum (the pillar of Zion). For his second wife he married the daughter of the Ethiopian Muslim King of Hadiya. After her conversion to Orthodoxy she received the empress name of Eleni, also in imitation of the Byzantine empress. Both Kwestantinos and Eleni would lead Ethiopia to the pinnacle of her power at the expense of the Kingdoms within the empire.

Afterwards Zara Yaqob took the opportunity to send another diplomatic mission to Europe in 1450. He obtained from Pope Nicholas V the dedication of St. Stefano Rotondo as an Ethiopian Church in Rome. He also communicated with Alfonso V of Aragon, then champion of Christians in the Oriental Mediterranean, asking for a group of artisans. Alfonso was sympathetic, but asked for guaranties of safe arrival since a previous group, solicited in times of Yeshaq, had all perished at the hands of Muslims during the trip.

Nicolò Brancaleon founded a studio and quickly became the foremost icon and fresco painter and illustrator of religious books. His best known work is the controversial fresco Madonna and Child at the Church of Atronsa Maryam which was destroyed by the Oromo in 1704. His works were still being discovered in Ethiopia in 20th century. After Nicolò's arrival, at least 17 more skilled Italians were imprisoned at the Emperor's court.

	#-#It was too bad that Lebna Dengel had dismissed the Portuguese ambassadors in 1526, because the next year and without warning Adal had started a war like no other in the history of Ethiopia. Lead by a mysterious warrior, that the Ethiopians called Grañ (Left-handed), and his men called Ahmad al-Fath (the Conqueror), the armies of Adal had been trained in Ottoman tactics, and were armed with flintlock firearms. The Ethiopians were great warriors. Raised in the highlands, they are one of the strongest populations on earth, and their armies were 5 to 10 times superior in numbers. Yet the only thing that they could do against the modern armies of Adal was to make them pay a hefty price for their victories. So they suffered a great defeat at the Awash river in the battle of Shimbra Kure in 1529. Lebna Dengel had 16,000 cavalry and 200,000 infantry against Ahmad 560 cavalry and 12,000 soldiers. Although the Ethiopians were able to kill 5,000 soldiers of Adal, their loses were much higher. Afterwards Ahmad penetrated deep into the highlands, attacking Dawaro and Shewa in 1531, then Amhara, Lasta, Bale, Hadya, Sidama and the Gurage. With half of former Ethiopia under his control, in 1535 Ahmad invaded Tigray in the North, sacking the sacred city of Aksum and destroying the Cathedral were the emperors had been crowned for centuries. But the worst part was the damage inflicted to the people of Ethiopia and Adal by Ahmad, that would change their demography forever. To finance his military campaign against his bigger neighbour, Ahmad used a scorched earth tactic, laying waste to the land and selling every Ethiopian he could capture, Muslim or Christian, as a slave. No Christian priest or nun was left alive by him. Lebna Dengel, outmaneuvered and out-musketed, fled from one province to another, trying to organize the resistance. There was no possibility of a peace agreement, as Ahmad was bent on the destruction of the Christian country. His elder son, Fiqtor, was killed in battle, and the youngest, Menas, was captured and sent as a slave to the Ottoman overlord of Yemen. In desperation, Lebna Dengel sent a plee for help to the King of Portugal. In doing that, he saved his country, but he would not see the result, as he died on the run, exhausted and miserable in 1540.

He came with 400 soldiers and 1000 arquebuses, plus some small cannons, but in Africa they were the equivalent of a full army. They didn't lose time and defeated Ahmad Grañ three times in 1541. After the rainy season they met him again overconfident, but Ahmed had petitioned help to the Ottoman bey of Yemen, Zebid Pasha, offering vassalage, and he was granted 900 Turkish soldiers and additional arms. At the battle of Wofla, on August 28, 1542, the Portuguese were defeated by the far superior army of Ahmad. Over half of them were killed, and the wounded Cristovão was captured, tortured and eventually beheaded. Believing the Portuguese destroyed, Ahmed dismissed 600 of the Ottomans to other duties, but was then confronted by the remaining Portuguese and the army of Gelawdewos, rearmed with the stored weapons. The battle of Wayna-Daga on February 21, 1543, was initially indecisive, but the Portuguese had sworn to avenge their leader, and singling out Ahmad, killed him. His army fell in confusion and was completely destroyed. The remaining of the forces of Adal abandoned Ethiopia and fell back to Harar. The war continued, now favorable to Ethiopia, and Bale was recovered.

In 1575, Emir Muhammad IV made the mistake of joining the rebellion of the governor of a Muslim province in the North East of Ethiopia. He was captured and executed by Emperor Sarsa Dengel, and this defeat saw the end of Adal's last army. In 1577, the emir transferred the sultanate of Adal to the Aussa oasis in the Danakil depression. This desert below sea-level was located in no-mans land between the Afars, the Ottomans at Massawa and the Ethiopians. By moving to one of the nastiest places in Africa the sultanate prolonged its nominal existence until it was overrun by Afars and Oromo in 1672. The city of Harar, remained viable behind its walls, independent from the sultanate since 1647, as a city-state. It always has been Muslim, and today is considered the fourth sacred city of Islam. For all practical purposes, 1577 saw the end of Adal as a state. The Ethiopians probably didn't notice it. Due to the Oromo they had lost control over most of the South, that was self-ruled by petty Kingdoms.

	#-#Susenyos refused to accept Yaqob as emperor, having been very close to his cousin Za Dengel. Susenyos had little chance against the nobility supporting Yaqob. However Susenyos was a resourceful military commander, and he enlisted the Oromo on his side. The Oromo had a very high military capability, and for the first time they were involved in the politics of their new country. From then on, the Oromo were a factor to be taken into consideration, becoming little by little the backbone of the Ethiopian army. Susenyos knew what he was doing. After defeating Ras Za Selassie, who took his side, he presented battle to the emperor Malik Sagad II Yaqob. During the battle Yaqob was killed, but his body was never found. To show the involvement of the Ethiopian Church in politics, the Abuna (Patriarch) Petros took command of Yaqob's army until he was also killed. Something that the Church would never forgive Susenyos. Emperor Susenyos was relatively removed from the main branch of the Solomonic Kings of Ethiopia, starting the so-called Gonder line. To tighten lose ends, he had one of Yaqob's sons strangled, and organized a military expedition against the Kingdom of Sennar (Nubia), where another son was rising an army, forcing him to exile to Rome. He also had two brothers of Yaqob beheaded. Susenyos also wrote several letters to Felipe III of Spain/Portugal asking for military help, but he never got it.
