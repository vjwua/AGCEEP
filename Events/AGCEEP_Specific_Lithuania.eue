But in fact, the real issue was the title of King for Vytautas. The Polish embassy, led by chancellor Jan Szafraniec and Zbigniew Olesnicki, the bishop of Krakow, protested harshly. Olesnicki gained an offical statement from Pope Martin V forbidding Vytautas to accept the crown from the hands of Sigismund, on the pretext that the latter hadn't been crowned as Emperor. It was a forceful blow for Sigismund, whose animosity for Poland grew even stronger. The final blow came from Jagiello, who had been threatened by the Poles that the treaty of succession of the crown of Poland signed in 1425 would be revoked if Vytautas was coronated.

Grown up and educated in Italy, she believed that financial resorces are required to strenghten royal authority and realize political plans and most of her actions led to the increase of the royal income. From Pope Leon X she obtained right to nominate man into a number of lucrative church positions. Was modernizing royal estates, redeeming previously mortgaged estates and in years 1536-1546 took over lucrative custom agencies in Lithuania. At the same time she was fortifying Jagiellon's estates in the south-eastern Poland and supported aggresive policy against Tatars. Very active on the arena of international politics, pursuited decisively anti-Habsburg policy supporting John Zapolya in 1526, acted to decrease influence of Hohenzollerns in Prussia and Silesia. Bona was also corresponding with Roxelana, favorite wife of Ottoman Sultan Suleyman. In later years Bona with her people were actually ruling country. Lithuania won war against Muscovy recovering Homel and Poland defeated Moldavia. Strenghtening of royal power and rule of the elites was obviously not welcomed by nobles.

However in the last two decades of the 16th century a lot of protestant refugees from France, South Germany and Italy arrived. These cultural elite brought fresh idea to the Kingdom of Lithuania whom had been pressed between her catholic and orthodox neighbors. The Radziwilli Kings had strong royal power and had opened the country for influences from abroad. Cities were much more important than in the Aristocracy of Poland, and thus the people of the cities quickly became a cultural and religious melting-pot spreading Protestantism to the rural lands around them. When whole provinces slowly became protestant the King started to support the Protestant Faith. First personally and later as a State-religion looking at Prussia and Sweden as ideals. This also meant that Lithuania could take an independent stance between Russia and Poland. However, the many different religions in Lithuania made the government make a very tolerant religious policy at least until the 1640's.

Lithuania and Brandenburg should sign a Holy Protestant Alliance and wage war on Poland. Brandenburg would be freed from her Prussian vassalage by Poland and Lithuania would whatever she wanted and could take from Poland. A faction of young governmental official cherished it, but the King was a very careful man. He and his closest advisors discussed. There conclusion was very plain. First it was an impossibility to support Germans against Poland in a war of aggression. Secondly the worst possible thing was total victory. If Lithuania took a mile of Polish land it would be a mile too much. Any conquests would include more Catholics and orthodox and worse more unruly magnates brought up in the Polish Anarchy of a country. So the King politely declined the honor, but instead he proposed a tract of trade and cultural exchange. However as most political well informed Lithuanian could have guessed it did not come much out of it. The Society of Brandenburg-Prussia had far more in common with Poland than with Lithuania. Lithuanian preferred to visit Stockholm, Copenhagen and Amsterdam too Berlin or Köningsberg.

To escape the egalitarian powers of the government and the King many of the started to interfere in local Polish business. Many of them owned as much lands on one as the other side of the border. They freely swapped lands with their Polish brother and thus managed to strengthen the Cause in both Poland and Lithuania. During the Deluge the Magnates of the Ukraine and the Wild lands fought all and everyone. Poland was in havoc and the Lithuanian King had to accept the fact that he only could control the Northern part of his lands. At these point King Aleksandras II mounted a huge campaign against the Tartars, Russians and Crimeans swapping up insurrective Magnates at the same time. He though stopped from interfering with the polish government, 'that last sane mind on that side of the border' as he called King Wladyslaw IV of Poland. The subjugated Magnates had two options. They either had to accept a tough reform package or get all there lands confiscated and pushed over the border to Poland. The choice was easy. They stay, but the reform was harsh. Only the state could now own land. The user only owned the right to use it. But to keep that right the user had to pay a user's fee decided by the King. With this vehicle the King started to break the large latifund holdings of the Magnates and again changing the fabric of society. His son continued the reform policy after the King was murdered by a Ukrainian Magnate on 30th March 1654.

The King had visited the theater in Vilnius and was shot by three cloaked men point blank when leaving his carriage to enter the Royal Palace. The King traveled lightly so his personal guards and servants all succumbed in the fighting and the murderers disappeared in the night. On 23rd the news hit the streets and thousands of angry people stormed the Russian Embassy lynching everyone in sight. The Russian Government immediately craved an official apology and to let Russian special police help the investigation. At the same time the Police Master of Vilnius, Rafal Kresmanikes, received a messenger from the Swedish Police Master in Dorpat, Gustav Adolf Reuterholm. Reuterholm disclosed a lead that Kresmanikes found leading to St: Petersburg. The young King, Ludwike Mykolas I, was furious. He allied with Poland and mobilized the army. Within three month the country was ready for war, a war of revenge.
