When the architect and sculptor Filippo Brunelleschi became interested in the project the main problem facing the architects was the construction of the dome. Huge engineering problems faced the placing of a dome on the octagonal Baptistry, and much argument had taken place on how to solve this and Brunelleschi set to work on finding an innovative solution. He combined his artistic skills, his mathematical skills and his understanding of mechanical devices when he made a proposal to the wardens of works of the cathedral when they set up a competition in 1418 to find the best solution to the problem of designing and constructing the dome. Brunelleschi proposed a double selfsupporting shell and a rib structure to support the enormous weight. He proposed brick as a building material, laid in rotating herringbone patterns. In 1420 Brunelleschi was awarded the commission and construction began.

The excitement was appeased by Giovanni de' Medici, who said, It is not well to go into things so long past, unless to learn something for our present guidance, and if in former times the taxation has been unjust, we ought to be thankful, that we have now discovered a method of making it equitable, and hope that this will be the means of uniting the citizens, not of dividing them, which would certainly be the case were they to attempt the recovery of taxes for the past, and make them equal to the present, and that he who is content with a moderate victory is always most successful, for those who would more than conquer, commonly lose.

Consequently the campaign were very exhausting and dragged on interminably, some battles were won and others lost, truces and peace treaties were made only to be broken, and no definite result was achieved. A peace treaty was also stipulated in Ferrara in 1428 in which at first Visconti stated to renounce claims to territories lying beyond the Panaro-Magra Rivers, but refused to concede the territories of Bergamo and Brescia to Venice, which was still occupying with her troops. Political and economic interests of both sides were conflicting and when the new Pope, Eugenius IV, was being suspected of involvement with the League to damage Milan, Visconti retaliated sending his troops to invade the Papal States. That represented a violation of the peace treaty and subsequently a new Antivisconti League was formed to wage war against Milan.

Rumours circulated that Cosimo was plotting to use mercenary troops to set himself up as ruler of Florence. When Rodolfo degli Albizzi managed to gain control of the 'signoria' (the governing council) he used his influence to have Cosimo imprisoned. Rather than executing the Medici, under pressure from the Medici's debtors and supporters he had the family exiled for ten years and declared them nobles, thereby excluding them from any role in the government of the city forever. Reluctant to act by force and willing to bide his time, Cosimo complied. Should we exile the Medici or overthrow Albizzi's government?

In the treaty signed in Cremona in 1441 Venice obtained the suzerainty over the cities of Brescia, Bergamo and Ravenna while Visconti had to confirm the independence of Genoa and to give up definitely his ambitious plan of a reborn Lombard Kingdom in Northern Italy.

Francesco Sforza, ruler of Milan and Venice, the chief state of the league confederates, who was more and more threatened by the advancing Ottomans in her eastern Mediterranean territories, convened a cease-fire while a bilateral treaty was hastily signed in Lodi on 7 April 1454. With that treaty Sforza was legitimated Duke of Milan. Without even being called for, Florence and the Pope had no choice then to endorse the treaty. The King of Naples, being a rightful claimant on the ducal throne reluctantly joined the alliance under the condition to keep Genoa out of it. Intended 'infra terminos italicos', that treaty showed the objective impossibility for all the Italian major powers (specifically Milan, Tuscany, Venice, Naples and Papal States) to prevail upon each other in the struggle for the hegemony in Italy and that the better solution was to come to terms with each other. That would have also avoided the practice of very expensive and pointless wars in the next future. Although the treaty actually played a minor part in Italian balance of powers and so won't be able to avoid future wars of aggression from inside as well from outside Italy, the post-Lodi era historically represented a period of relative peace in which the figurative arts definitively flourished in the whole Italian peninsula, as well as economy and trade and, last but not the least, the skills and tricks of the art of diplomacy.

Michelangelo, who held music in contempt for its ephemerality, was not pleased, but he dared not refuse the son of his old patron, so he sculpted a statue of snow. Piero rejoiced at the beauty of it, but we can only guess how the great artist felt when it had melted the very next day. Safe to say, Piero had alienated yet another of his father's old allies.

He extracted a promise from the French King to respect the freedom of the city, but only in return for handing over some of the most important fortresses protecting Florentine territory. When the news of this arrangement reached the city, it aroused a great wave of anger and resentment. Piero, forgetting the lessons of his ancestors, had already made himself unpopular by his arrogance and his flaunting of his position. The consequence was an uprising that drove out Piero and his rule and restored a more popular government. The new government admitted the French to the city, and some tense negotiations took place, in which the Florentines feared that Charles would try to restore Piero and become their master. The determination of the citizens to resist these demands, by arms if need be, so impressed Charles that he did not press them, but departed leaving the city its freedom. He held on to the fortresses, including Pisa, which had thrown off Florentine rule at the approach of the French. To regain Pisa was a passion with Florence, and the hope of doing so with French help was one reason why Florence made an alliance with France and stuck to it faithfully during the next few years.

	desc = "EVENTHIST331049"
	#-#Born in the Castle of Mirandola (in the Duchy of Modena) at the age of fourteen went to Bologna to study Canon Law, but, repelled by the purely positivist science of Law, he traveled to chief universities of Italy and France where he studied Hebrew, Syriac, Arabic, Latin and Greek as well as the philosophy of Averroes. In December 1486, Pico published in Rome his 900 these and invited all scholars to a public disputation in January, 1487. However, Pope Innocent VIII suspended the disputation and appointed a commission to examine the theses. Pico published an Apologia to defend his theses, but this only made things worse and started a conflict with the Papal authorities that lasted for the rest of his life. Pico then fled to Florence, where he became an important part of the Academy there, even though he stood in opposition to the standard Platonism fashionable there. His most important work - which is still studied by philosophers today - was the Oration on the Dignity of Man, which was probably originally composed in preparation for the disputation. It held that man was separate from the rest of nature not because we were the center of the universe, but because we are free to become either animals or angels, or, that is, anything in it: ''I have set thee,' says the Creator to Adam, 'in the midst of the world, that thou mayst the more easily behold and see all that is therein. I created thee a being neither heavenly nor earthly, neither mortal nor immortal only, that thou mightest be free to shape and to oversome thyself. Thou mayst sink into a beast, and be born anew to the divine likeness. To thee alone is given a growth and a development depending on thine own free will. Thou bearest in thee the germs of a universal life.'' In his later life he dedicated his work to defending Christianity against the Jews and Mohammedans and became a follower of Savonarola. His interest in Kabbalah led to a broad current of Christian Kabbalahism which included John Reuchlin and remained important throughout the 16th century. On Pico's deathbed, Savonarola had a vision where the Virgin came to assure him that Pico would not die. Savonarola explained this vision later by saying that the Virgin meant the 'second' life, not the first. In his funeral oration for his friend, Savonarola criticized Pico for not entering a monastic order, but reassured his audience that Pico would be found safely in Purgatory, due to the preacher's alms and prayers. Pico della Mirandola died on 17 November 1494, the day King Charles VIII entered Italy. The Oration was published posthumously.

These two artists were Michelangelo Buonarroti, who chose to represent the 'Battle of Cascina' fought in 1364 between Florence and Pisa, and Leonardo da Vinci, who chose to represent the 'Battle of Anghiari', fought in 1440 between Florence and the Duke of Milan. Instead of a mixture of men and horses fiercely struggling around a flag sketched by Leonardo, Michelangelo focused more on exalting the human action through the representation of several bare figures in movement. It was during his stay in Florence that Leonardo painted his most famous portrait 'la Monna Lisa', also known as 'la Gioconda', named after Francesco Bartolomeo del Giocondo, the husband of the assumedly portraited woman. During his life Leonardo would never separate himself from this 'enigmatic smile'. In the meanwhile Michelangelo was sculpting one of his most famous marble statues 'il David'. Although both the cartoons were ready, unfortunately the frescos commissioned by the Florentine Republic were never realized: Leonardo was invited to come back in Milan by the French King Louis XII, while Michelangelo went to Rome on Pope Julius II's request.

The remarkable influence he had over the head of state enabled Machiavelli to realize his military ideas. For centuries the states of Italy had used mercenary troops in their wars, and Machiavelli had seen in practice their lack of discipline, their faithlessness, and their dangerous arrogance. Inspired both by the military enterprises of ancient Rome and by his own observations in France (where he went on a second mission early in 1504) and in the Romagna (where Cesare Borgia had replaced mercenaries with troops levied from his own territory), Machiavelli ardently pursued the idea of giving the Florentine state a militia of its own, recruited from the citizens under its control. Family rivalries, and reluctance of townsmen to arm men from the country districts around Florence may need to be overcome.

The friar cares not for the health of souls, but only for the fattening of his pockets. And Machiavelli asserts the superiority of classical values to medieval ones judging his times degenerate and having the protagonist say : 'And in Hell how many worthy men there are!'. Still, in Mandragola you find evidence of a new European idea of drama as Machiavelli includes wry criticisms of contemporary dramatic theory inside the body of the play.

This decision was received with horror by the Sienese who begged with Charles V not to proceed. He refused, and several Sienese citizens in Rome received aid from French agents and collected an army. In 1552, as they marched on Siena the people revolted and threw out the Spanish troops, and an independent Siena took up a pro-French policy. Henri II, King of France, tried to exploit the situation by sending there an army led by Paul de Termes, who was successively substituted by Strozzi when an invasion of Corsica was attempted with the help of the Turkish fleet. On Emperor Charles V's decision to inflict an exemplary punishment upon the rebeling city, Cosimo I Duke of Tuscany responded to his call by invading and pillaging the villages surrounding Siena with the help of Spanish/imperial troops. After a year long siege laid by Medeghino and his Florentine troops, the city of Siena was eventually taken.

In 1609 he built a telescope and began detailed observations of the sky. However his disagreements with the Aristotelean canon made his life at the University of Padua increasingly difficult as he met accusations from the Church and the opposition of detractors at the University.

In facts many were the interests of the House of Habsburg in exercising its hegemonic power in Italy in order to chase any Bourbon interference out of the peninsula. During his rule, Francesco II preferred to live in Vienna and never visited Florence. Although the country was reasonably well administered under his reign, Tuscany was very heavily taxed to support Francesco's court and Austria's wars.

	#-#In 1764, Cesare Bonesana, Marquis of Beccaria, published a brief but justly celebrated treatise, 'Dei Delitti e delle Pene' (On Crimes and Punishments), which marked the high point of the Milan Enlightenment. In it, Beccaria put forth the first arguments ever made against the death penalty. His treatise was also the first full work of penology, advocating reform of the criminal law system. Apart from condemning the death penalty (on two grounds: first, because the state does not possess the right to take lives and secondly, because capital punishment is neither a useful nor a necessary form of punishment), Beccaria developed in his treatise a number of innovative and influential principles: punishment had a preventive, not a retributive, function, punishment should be proportionate to the crime committed, the certainty of punishment, not its severity, would achieve the preventive effect, procedures of criminal convictions should be public and finally, in order to be effective, punishment should be prompt. The book was the first full-scale work to tackle criminal reform and to suggest that criminal justice should conform to rational principles. In this, Beccaria reflected the convictions of the 'Il Caffè' group, who sought to cause reform through Enlightenment discourse. Put across in a clear and animated style, the book's serious message was based in particular upon a deep sense of humanity and of urgency at unjust suffering. This humane sentiment was what made Beccaria appeal for rationality in the laws. In 1786 Pietro Leopoldo of Habsburg-Lorraine was the first European monarch to reform the penal code with his 'Codice Leopoldino', he but followed Beccaria's argument about the lack of utility of capital punishment, not about the state's lacking right to execute citizens.
