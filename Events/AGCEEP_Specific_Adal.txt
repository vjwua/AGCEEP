	#-#In 1415 Ethiopian Emperor Yeshaq had finally destroyed the sultanate of Ifat, that with the help of the Afar Muslims had raised in rebellion against his father. The Walashma sultan Saad ad-Din II of Ifat was pursued and cornered at the important trading port of Saylac. Yeshaq conquered the city and killed the sultan, but his family crossed the sea and took refuge in Yemen. The sons of Saad, returned a few years later, taking the name of sultans of Adal, since Ifat was now under Christian hands. Sabr, Mansur and Jamal were soon killed in fights against Ethiopia or between Muslims. It was then up to the young Shihab Badlay to avenge his father. Since Saylac had been sacked several times, he moved the capital to Dakkar, near Hargeisa. He then conquered the province of Bale, and twice invaded Ethiopia in three years trying to conquer the Muslim state of Dawaro, gaining the nickname of Arwe (the beast). However, at the battle of Gomit, in 1445, he was defeated by emperor Zara Yaqob, killed and dismembered.

Increased power meant also increased needs, and a new base was created at Harar, near the border of the Great Rift, within easy reach of the Christian Northern Highlands and the Afar Delta to raid for slaves. This military base created by then candidate Abu Bakr in 1520, soon expanded, and when finally Abu Bakr rose to power in 1525, he decided to move his capital to Harar. Although it constituted a superb place to launch attacks on Ethiopia, it was a strategic mistake, because it further removed Adal from its real source of wealth, Saylac.

	#-#At the turn of the XVI century Adal was submerged in chaos. Since Ethiopia was strong under a succession of capable rulers, the Sultan of Adal, Muhammad II tried to maintain peace. At the same time, an Imam, Mahfuz, ruler of the port of Saylac started to pursue a rigorous Islamic conduct, including Jihad against the Christians. In control of the port, he was buying flintstock musquets from Ottoman merchants, and conducting succesful raids into Ethiopia to pay for them in loot and slaves. When Muhammad and Mahfuz went together to raid Ethiopia in 1517, the Ethiopian emperor ambushed them. The sultan escaped, but Mahfuz was killed. However the sultan was murdered the next year plunging Adal into a civil war. Under these circumstances, a man emerged that would turn Adal from an obscure sultanate into ''Diraasal-Islaam'', a powerful nation renowed by her virtue and Muslim rigor. He was Ahmad ibn Ibrihim al-Ghazi, known as Sahib al-Fath (the Conqueror). His rise to fame started with his marriage with Mahfuz's daughter, atracting to him his powerful party and giving him control of the port of Saylac. He also married his sister to Mattan ibn Uthman, a great Somali commander that would play an important role in his battles. That way he also added a sizeable Somali army to his forces. He then got the support of the Ottomans, who had grown suspicious of the contacts between Ethiopians and Portuguese. It was easy for him then to kill Sultan Abu Bakr and install his brother Umar Din as a puppet. He was ready to take on Ethiopia.

	#-#After seizing power, Ahmad ibn Ibrihim al-Ghazi decided to launch a Jihad against Christian Ethiopia. Adal was a much smaller country, and with far less resources, but this did not stop Ahmad, who had a plan. Besides uniting Muslims from Adal, Ethiopia, Somalia and Afar under his banner, he created an elite corps drilled according to Ottoman standards, and armed with very expensive flintlock arquebuses imported through Saylac. The Ottomans offered their support for a price. The critical moment came when Adal had to pay the annual tribute to Ethiopia imposed after a previous lost war. Under his orders, the sultan refused to pay, and Ahmad destroyed the punitive expedition sent by Ethiopia. Ahmad had started the fire of the Jihad, but to feed it, he started consuming both countries. To finance the overtaxing war, Ahmad transformed Saylac into the biggest slave market in Africa. Over the years, hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of slaves from Ethiopia and Adal, both Christians and Muslims were sold to pay armies and buy arms and munitions. Allah demanded such sacrifice and both countries were ravaged and depopulated. Portuguese accounts speak of the huge sale of Ethiopian slaves Christian and Muslims from Egypt to India in those decades. The Indian princes became very found of Ethiopian slaves as they made very good soldiers, and entire armies of slaves were purchased in Gujarat. Before starting this Jihad, be aware that we must eradicate the Christians before the effects of the war consume our country, or we will pay a hefty price.

	#-#After invading Ethiopia, Ahmad met the army of the Ethiopian Emperor Lebna Dengel or Dawit IV at the Awash river in the battle of Shimbra Kure in 1529. Lebna Dengel had 16,000 cavalry and 200,000 infantry against Ahmad 560 cavalry and 12,000 soldiers. Although the Ethiopians were able to kill 5,000 soldiers of Adal, their loses were much higher. Afterwards Ahmad penetrated deep into the highlands, attacking Dawaro and Shewa in 1531, then Amhara, Lasta, Bale, Hadya, Sidama and the Gurage. With half of former Ethiopia under his control, in 1535 Ahmad invaded Tigray in the North, sacking the sacred city of Aksum and destroying the Cathedral were the emperors had been crowned for centuries. But the worst part was the damage inflicted to the people of Ethiopia and Adal by Ahmad, that would change their demography forever. To finance his military campaign against his bigger neighbour, Ahmad used a scorched earth tactic, laying waste to the land and selling every Ethiopian he could capture, Muslim or Christian, as a slave. No Christian priest or nun was left alive by him. Lebna Dengel, outmanoeuvred and out-musketed, fled from one province to another, trying to organize the resistance. There was no possibility of a peace agreement, as Ahmad was bent on the destruction of the Christian country. His elder son, Fiqtor, was killed in battle, and the youngest, Menas, was captured and sent as a slave to the Ottoman overlord of Yemen. In desperation, Lebna Dengel sent a plee for help to the King of Portugal. In doing that, he saved his country, but he would no see the result, as he died on the run, exhausted and miserable in 1540.

	#-#When the Portuguese arrived to help Ethiopia, Ahmad was about to win the entire Kingdom, with the emperor in hiding and the Ethiopians accepting his supremacy. The King of Portugal had sent Cristovão da Gama, son of famous explorer Vasco da Gama, with 400 soldiers and 1000 arquebuses, plus some small cannons. Surprised, Ahmad was defeated three times, but he had a last card to play. He offered his vassalage to the Ottoman bey of Yemen, Zebid Pasha, in exchange for help. He was granted 900 Turkish soldiers and additional arms, and at the battle of Wofla, on August 28, 1542, the Portuguese were defeated, and Cristovão was captured, tortured and beheaded. Believing the Portuguese destroyed, Ahmed dismissed 600 of the Ottomans to other duties, but was then confronted by the remaining Portuguese and the army of Gelawdewos, rearmed with the stored weapons. The battle of Wayna-Daga on February 21, 1543, was initially indecisive, but the Portuguese had sworn to avenge their leader, and singling out Ahmad, killed him. His army fell in confusion and was completely destroyed. The remaining of the forces of Adal abandoned Ethiopia and fell back to Harar. The war continued, now favorable to Ethiopia, and Bale was lost. Afars and Somalies abandoned the war, leaving exhausted Adal almost an empty shell. Ahmad's widow, Del Wambara, offered herself to Ahmad's nephew, Nur ibn Mujtahid, on the condition of continuing the fight. Nur reinforced his base, by walling the city of Harar with the famous Jugol, to prevent another sacking, and in 1556 he launched a two front coordinated attack with Ottoman help. The Ottomans, leaded by Ozdemur Pasha, conquered Massawa, the best port of the Red Sea, and the only one the Ethiopians had, but their attempt to reach the highlands failed against the determined Ethiopian resistance. The attack by Nur was an even worse failure, taking the life of the last of the Walashma sultans of Adal, Barakat. The death of Ethiopian Emperor Gelawdewos at the walls of Harar did not compensate the last failure of Adal. The survival of Ethiopia meant the death of Adal. Nur took over the crown of Adal, but his authority didn't extend far beyond the walls of Harar, and things were about to get much worse.
