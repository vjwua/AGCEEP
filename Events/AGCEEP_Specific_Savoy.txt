Romagna should have been Visconti's next step in his threatening hegemonic plan. But Invading Romagna, the duke of Milan would break the 1420 peace treaty stipulated with the Florentine Republic as to guarantee 10 years of non-belligerence. That treaty notably forbade Visconti from intervening in the lands beyond Panaro-Magra Rivers and so in Romagna and Tuscany, territories in which Florence directly exercised her influence. Florentine army alone was not enough powerful to face the Milanese well paid Mercenari. A League against Visconti urged immediately.

After 2 years and half of life, isolated and surrounded by the unfaithful Sforza, who in the meanwhile and with the support of Venice turned against the city of Milan aiming at the ducal throne, the Ambrosian Republic eventually ceased to exist. Brought to severe famine the citizenship of Milan was forced to surrender to the condottiero and accept him as their new Duke. As soon as Sforza proclaimed himself successor of Visconti to the throne of Milan and the Holy Roman Emperor didn't acknowledge him the ducal investiture, the war of succession inevitably began. All legitimated or self-proclaimed claimants of the Milanese throne, took arms against him. Charles of Orléans and Louis of Savoy because of their family ties with the House of Visconti, Alfons of Aragon because of an alleged secret agreement with the last Visconti Duke which would have entitled him to the duchy of Milan.

	#-#The medieval Inquisition tried a large number of witches, but collective witch-hunting was exclusively a modern phenomena. Individual maleficium (Latin for witchcraft) was not uncommon in many rural areas, but it wasn't until scholastic demonology related witches and Sabbaths (night meetings with strong conspiracy elements, including cannibalism, orgies and a sacred oath of loyalty to Satan himself) that societies started to get obsessed with the matter. This conspiracy paranoia can track its roots as far as to the first massacres of Jews and Lepers in the High Middle Ages, when thousands were slaughtered by defeated Crusaders and angry countrymen. But it's in the early 15th century when demonological theories will become fully accepted by the upper classes. The Councils of Constance and Basel are considered to be the first public space in which these concepts, maleficium and Sabbath were publicly related. The work of Johannes Nider (1380-1438), The Formicarius (The Anthill), was a masterpiece of scholastic demonology and marked a new era in witch-hunting. The work of Heinrich Kramer (1430-1505), Malleus Maleficarum (Hammer of the Wicked) was the first work that reaches widespread attention, and works as a inquisitorial manual for witch-hunters. But it's not the Church that tries the most in Modern Ages. On the contrary, civil courts are responsible for 85-90 percent of executions. \n \nNorthern Savoyard valleys were highly affected by witch-hunting, as their proximity to Switzerland (and consequently to both Councils) made the region highly influenced by Inquisitorial practices.

	#-#It is believed to be the Jesus' burial shroud. The known provenance of this cloth dates to 1357, when the widow of the French knight Geoffroy de Charny had it displayed in a church at Lirey, France. During the fourteenth century, the Shroud was often publicly exposed, though not continuously, and also denounced as a fraud but indulgences for pilgrimages to see the Shroud were however prescribed by the Antipope Clement VII. In 1418, in order to provide protection against criminal bands the Lirey canons handed the Shroud over to Humbert of Villersexel, Marguerite of Charny's husband, who moved it to his castle at Montfort and later to Saint-Hippolyte-sur-Doubs, in his estates. After Humbert's death, his widow kept the Shroud in spite of claims of ownership by the canons of Lirey and travelled with it to various expositions, notably in Liège and Geneva. In 1453 in Geneva, she sold the image to Louis I of Savoy in exchange for a castle in Varambon. Louis of Savoy, the new owner, stored the Shroud in Chambéry in the newly-built Sainte Chapelle, which Pope Paul II shortly thereafter raised to the dignity of a collegiate church. In 1464, by an accord drawn up in Paris Louis I agreed to pay an annual fee to the Lirey canons in exchange for their dropping claims of ownership of the cloth. The accord specifically noted that the Shroud had been given to the church of Lirey by Geoffrey de Charny, lord of Savoisy and Lirey, and that it had then been transferred to Louis of Savoy by Marguerite de Charny. That agreement finally legitimated the House of Savoy to own the sacred 'Sindon'.

Francesco Sforza, ruler of Milan and Venice, the chief state of the league confederates, who was more and more threatened by the advancing Ottomans in her eastern Mediterranean territories, convened a cease-fire while a bilateral treaty was hastily signed in Lodi on 7 April 1454. With that treaty Sforza was legitimated Duke of Milan. Without even being called for, Florence and the Pope had no choice then to endorse the treaty. The King of Naples, being a rightful claimant on the ducal throne reluctantly joined the alliance under the condition to keep Genoa out of it. Intended 'infra terminos italicos', that treaty showed the objective impossibility for all the Italian major powers (specifically Milan, Tuscany, Venice, Naples and Papal States) to prevail upon each other in the struggle for the hegemony in Italy and that the better solution was to come to terms with each other. That would have also avoided the practice of very expensive and pointless wars in the next future. Although the treaty actually played a minor part in Italian balance of powers and so won't be able to avoid future wars of aggression from inside as well from outside Italy, the post-Lodi era historically represented a period of relative peace in which the figurative arts definitively flourished in the whole Italian peninsula, as well as economy and trade and, last but not the least, the skills and tricks of the art of diplomacy.

The war that followed between the Burgundians and the Swiss, the latter with the support of French and Milanese troops brought to the loss of Valais territories in favour of the Swiss confederation. The internal struggle between local nobles that broke out following the war was eventually ended by Philippe de Bresse who proclaimed himself protector of Duke Philibert 'the Hunter' until the Duke's death, which occurred in 1482.

The Duke's mother, Bianca of Montferrat, had temporarily assumed the regency of the duchy due to her son's under age, but the presence of different factions that sought and received some support from the French King, contributed to the political instability of Savoy as to establish de facto a sort of French protectorate. Being Savoy still an imperial fief, Maximilian I King of the Romans and future Holy Roman Emperor tried to get the Savoyard allegiance in order to drive the French out of Italy. The strategic position of Savoy would put the ducal independence at risk, leaving the country in anarchy until the end of the Italian wars in which Savoy, historically drifted into the French orbit, gained complete independence only in 1559 when the treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis was signed between France and Spain.

	#-#The medieval Inquisition tried a large number of witches, but collective witch-hunting was exclusively a modern phenomena. Individual maleficium (Latin for witchcraft) was not uncommon in many rural areas, but it wasn't until scholastic demonology related witches and Sabbaths (night meetings with strong conspiracy elements, including cannibalism, orgies and a sacred oath of loyalty to Satan himself) that societies started to get obsessed with the matter. This conspiracy paranoia can track its roots as far as to the first massacres of Jews and Lepers in the High Middle Ages, when thousands were slaughtered by defeated Crusaders and angry countrymen. But it's in the early 15th century when demonological theories will become fully accepted by the upper classes. The Councils of Constance and Basel are considered to be the first public space in which these concepts, maleficium and Sabbath were publicly related. The work of Johannes Nider (1380-1438), The Formicarius (The Anthill), was a masterpiece of scholastic demonology and marked a new era in witch-hunting. The work of Heinrich Kramer (1430-1505), Malleus Maleficarum (Hammer of the Wicked) was the first work that reaches widespread attention, and works as a inquisitorial manual for witch-hunters. But it's not the Church that tries the most in Modern Ages. On the contrary, civil courts are responsible for 85-90 percent of executions. \n \nNorthern Savoyard valleys were highly affected by witch-hunting, as their proximity to Switzerland (and consequently to both Councils) made the region highly influenced by Inquisitorial practices.

Louis demanded that Savoy expel the Vaudois, and Vittorio Amedeo II reluctantly complied. The Vaudois under Henri Arnaud went to Switzerland, but never forgot the valleys that they had inhabited for 500 years.

They fought their way back to their valleys. Vittorio Amedeo II called for support from the French and mobilized his forces to expel the Vaudois, while the protestant powers prepared an expedition to support them, and raise the Huguenots in France. Faced with this threat to his state, and the French demand that he hand over several important fortresses, Vittorio Amedeo II abandoned his alliance with France and went to war as an ally of England and Holland. In return for their support Savoy agreed to give full toleration to the Vaudois, and to allow them to accept protestant refugees. The Vaudois returned from Switzerland, and made up an important part of Savoy's armies in the wars that followed.

He then stored the Shroud in Chambery in the newly-built Sainte Chapelle which the Pope Paul II shortly thereafter raised to the dignity of a collegiate church. Beginning in 1471, the Shroud was moved between many cities of Savoy and Piedmont and also housed there briefly. In 1532 the Shroud suffered damage from a fire in the chapel where it was stored in Chambéry. A drop of molten silver from the reliquary produced a symmetrically-placed mark through the layers of the folded cloth. Chambéry's poor Clare Nuns attempted to repair this damage with patches. In 1578, after having been continuously transferred from one place to another for protection against war devastations, the Shroud arrived at last to its final destination, the Cathedral of Turin. Since then the Shroud was frequently carried out in religious processions and also brought in public exhibitions as well as in private showings only for the most notable people. Turin became an important centre of Christian pilgrimage.

Internally, the republican party of the Girondins were calling for a war to rid Europe of monarchy and despotism but also to rid France of any internal reactions. Externally, the nobility, the socalled emigrés, fleeing to Austria and Prussia requested that those powers intervene to restore the French monarchy. Louis XVI, King of the French, saw in a war failure the possibility to restore absolutism. But the dissolution of the Ancien Régime in France alarmed all the European royal courts fearing that the French Jacobinism would have spread in the whole continent and provoked deep destabilization inside their own absolutist government systems.
