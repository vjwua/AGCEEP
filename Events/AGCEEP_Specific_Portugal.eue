This place, a promontory on the edge of the open ocean, had an otherworldly reputation, and had been called the Sacred Promontory by Marinus and Ptolomy (from which the name Sagres derives). Prince Henry made his base for sea exploration, making it a centre for cartography, navigation and shipbuilding. The Catalan Jew from Majorca, Jehuda Cresques, son of the cartographer Abraham Cresques, was brought to Sagres to supervise the collation of geographic facts brought back by Henry's explorers, who were encouraged and later required to keep detailed logs of their voyages. Muslims and Arabs, Italians from Genoa and Venice, Germans and Scandinavians came to Sagres. This community developed navigational instruments such as the quadrant, and new mathematical tables to aid in determining latitude. The local port of Lagos saw the development of a new type of ship, the caravel.

At the urging of Prince Henry, one of his captains, Gil Eannes, finally passed Cape Bojador in 1434. Further improvements in Caravel design also promoted the exploration of the African Coast.

The argument must have been a good one, because Eugenius IV, knee deep in his problems with the Council of Basel, reversed his previous decision and published a bull in 1436 recognizing the rights of Castile to all the islands and exhorting Portugal to not enter a war with Castile over them. There would still be a couple of failed attempts at their conquest by the Portuguese in 1448 and 1455, but with the finding of better islands in the coast of Africa to act as bases, the interest for the Canary islands decayed. Meanwhile the Castilians were advancing all the time in their settlement, and finally between 1477 and 1496 the Catholic King's armies fully conquered the remaining islands.

In 1437 Portugal sent an expedition against Tangier, led by Henry. The expedition failed, due largely to mistakes by Henry, and his youngest brother Fernão, the master of Avis, was captured. He was imprisoned in bad conditions, held hostage for the return of Ceuta to the Muslims. For eleven years the Portuguese debated whether or not to give up Ceuta, until in 1448 Dom Fernão died in captivity. Henry's brother Duarte died shortly after the Tangier expedition, leaving his six year old son Afonso as the King. There was a fight over the regency between Duarte's widow and Henry's brother D. Pedro which Pedro eventually won.

	#-#In 1469 Alfonso V of Portugal was presented with the opportunity of becoming the King of Castile when he and his brother-in-law Enrique IV of Castile agreed on his marriage to Isabel, Princess of Asturias (heir title). But the deal failed when Isabel married Fernando of Aragon. When Enrique died and Isabel proclaimed herself Queen, in 1475, he saw his chance disappearing and decided to play hard. In a month he was married to his niece, Juana, and had claimed the crown of Castile for himself, invading the country. The plan was good because Juana had also the support of France and a great part of the Castilian nobility who rebelled in her support. Despite the simultaneous invasion from France and Portugal, and the rebellion of the nobles in the West of Castile, the war did not go well. The French were stopped by the Basques, while Fernando, with troops mostly from Castile and Asturias, inflicted a crushing defeat to the Portuguese in Toro in 1476. Alfonso traveled to France to try to get a stronger involvement from Louis XI, but the French had lost interest. By then Fernando had recovered control of all the Northwest. The war at sea, that extended as far as the coast of Guinea, claimed by Castile, was also favorable to Isabel. Alfonso's marriage to his niece was not recognized by the Pope, and a last invasion at the South ended also in defeat at la Albuera in February, 1479. With the nobility subdued and the Portuguese defeated, Castile had now the upper hand, but Isabel was half Portuguese herself, and Portuguese was her first language. She desired a perpetual peace with Portugal, with long lasting friendship and perhaps a dynastic union in the future, like the one with Aragon, and she was prepared to be generous with the defeated to obtain it. The treaty of Alcacovas, was concluded in September 4, 1479. It had four parts, all of them historically important. In the first part, Isabel and Fernando were recognized as rightful Kings of Castile and Leon, and Alfonso was recognized as rightful King of Portugal. In the second part, Juana renounced to her claim to the crown of Castile and was forced to expend the rest of her life in a convent in Portugal. In the third part, the future marriage between the infant Alfonso, son of Joao and the infant Isabel, daughter of the Catholic Kings was arranged. And in the fourth part, Castile accepted the claim of Portugal over Guinea, and the Atlantic coast of Africa, Madeira, Azores and Cape Verde, and any future discoveries South of the Canary Islands toward Guinea. Portugal accepted the claim of Castile over the Canary Islands. The treaty of Alcacovas is very important because it created a long lasting peace between Portugal and Spain, and set the basis for future diplomatic resolution of conflicts, like the discovery of the New World and the treaty of Tordesillas.

Immediately, the nobles started to conspire. João II did nothing but observe. Letters of complaint and pleas to intervene were exchanged between the Duke of Bragança and Queen Isabel I of Spain. In 1483, this correspondence was intercepted by royal spies. The House of Bragança was outlawed, their lands confiscated and the Duke executed in Évora. After the nobility appealed to Spain, the King ordered the execution of the Duke of Bragança and later executed the Duke of Viseu himself. Many other people were executed, murdered, fled or exiled to Castile including the Bragança Bishop of Évora who was probably poisoned in prison. \n \nJoão II restyled the flag of Portugal in 1485, introducing important changes: the removal of the Aviz cross, a downward arrangement and edge-smoothing of the 'quinas' (blue bezant-charged escutcheons), and the definitive fixing of five saltire-arranged bezants in each 'quina' and seven castles on the bordure.

The latter had been a pupil of the Rabbi Abraham ben Samuel Zacuto at the University of Salamanca and he provided the commission with a copy of the Rabbi's Almanach Perpetuum Colestium Motium (Perpetual Almanac of the Heavenly Bodies) which consisted of tables that listed the declination of the sun over the course of the year.

It also included the Regimento do Norte which gve rules on how to use the Pole Star to determine latitude and the Regimento do Sol which provided rules and tables to allow sailors to use the height of the sun at noon to determine their latitude. Coupled with improvements in navigational instruments this information greatly eased the navigational problems that had bedevilled earlier explorers.

So Manuel issued a decree forcing all Jews to leave Portugal by October 1497. He tried to convert as many Jews to Christianity as he could to keep them in Portugal. Jewish parents were ordered to take their children to Lisbon. Upon arrival, the parents were informed that their children were going to be taken away from them and were to be given to Catholic families to be raised as good Catholics. Some parents agreed to be baptized, along with their children, while others succumbed and handed over their children. In October 1497, about 20,000 Jews came to Lisbon to prepare for departure to other lands. They were herded into the courtyard of Os Estaos Palace where priests attempted to convert them. Those who did not convert were told they forfeited their freedom and would become slaves.

	#-#When Pedro Álvares Cabral returned from the second Portuguese voyage to the Indies King Manuel I realized that it would not be possible to secure the spice trade with India without using force. He instructed his new Viceroy D. Francisco de Almeida: ''It seems to us that nothing would be would serve us better than to have a fortress at the mouth of the Red Sea or near to it  rather inside it than outside might afford the better control  because from there we could see to it that no spice would pass to the land of the Sultan of Egypt, and all those in India would lose the false notion that they could trade any more, save through us... You should collect our ships after accomplishing all you are commanded to do at Quilon... and when these are collected, it would please us for you to pass to the mouth of the Red Sea.'' In furtherance of Manuel's instructions the Portuguese attempted to control all the shipping in the Indian Ocean by a system of cartazes (passes) that each shipowner was required to purchase to prevent his ship from being seized. Furthermore they forced merchants to come to Goa by creating monopolies in items like the Arabian horses highly sought after by Indian rulers for their cavalry.

He then returned to Cairo. From there he forwarded his information together with advise on the best sea-route to India to his King, before continuing to Aden, Ormuz, and Saylac, in the coast of Adal. He finally arrived to Ethiopia in 1490, being well received by Emperor Eskander. After four years of stay, he was preparing his departure, with a proposal of an alliance from the Emperor of Ethiopia to the King of Portugal, when Eskander died. He was succeded by his brother Naod, who forbade Pêro's departure. Around 1510, King Manuel received an ambassador from Ethiopia, an Armenian called Matthew. In the name of Empress Eleni, he proposed an alliance between Ethiopia and Portugal. It would be 10 years before Portuguese ambassadors went to Ethiopia with a positive answer. By then things had changed and the new Emperor showed no interest. However this time Emperor Dawit II, better known as Lebna Dengel, might be having problems with their Muslim neighbours, as he is requesting to enter vassalage to the King of Portugal.

According to legend, Prester John could help Europe fend off the Muslim assaults. Although the myth had no basis, it seemed to fit Ethiopia better than any other place. Except that when re-discovered by Europe, Ethiopia was backwards and beleaguered, more in need of help than capable of lending it. Around 1510, King Manuel received an ambassador from Ethiopia, an Armenian called Matthew. In the name of Empress Eleni, he proposed an alliance between Ethiopia and Portugal. It would be 10 years before Portuguese ambassadors went to Ethiopia with a positive answer. By then things had changed and the new Emperor showed no interest. However in 1535 facing a war of extermination by Adal, the same Ethiopian Emperor sent a plee to the Pope and the King of Portugal by way of Juan Bermudez, a Portuguese priest that had remained in Ethiopia. Bermudez claimed that the Emperor had promised to turn his country into Catholicism if help was forwarded, and requested to be named archbishop of the new Ethiopian Catholic Church. This has been a controversial issue since, but Bermudez's description of the horrors inflicted on the Christian Ethiopians, the destruction of their churches, and the killing of their priests and nuns, plus the desire to control the entrance to the Red Sea, moved King João III 'o Piedoso' (the Pius) to order the new Viceroy of India, Estevão da Gama, to send military aid to Ethiopia. He sent his own brother Cristovão in command of a small but well-equipped army.

Born in 1524 or 1525, Camões came from a noble family of reduced means. He belonged to the same stock as the noted explorer, Vasco da Gama, who figures importantly in The Lusiads. His life was one of adventure with voyages to distant lands, impossible love affairs, shipwrecks, duels and combat. He was willing to spend more than he earned, which lead to his poverty in his old age. Nevertheless, he was able to publish his Magnum Opus (The Lusiads) in 1572 dedicating it to the visionary and foolhardy King Dom Sebastião. He died in 1580.

It achieved some military successes, but was decimated by disease, including the death of Barreto in July 1573. Vasco Fernandes Homem succeeded him and withdrew the expedition back to Moçambique to recuperate. He was determined that this time the expedition would take the route through Sofala to reach Monomotapa. He reached some of the gold and silver mines and forced the local chief to pay tribute. The outpost he left behind to exploit the silver mines was overwhelmed and destroyed not long after his return to Moçambique. The most important legacies of the expedition were the opening of the area to Portuguese merchants, the consolidation of Portuguese control of the Zambezi River Valley with the establishment of captaincies at Sena and Tete and the knowledge that due to the dispersed nature of the gold mines it was much easier to gain it by trade than by conquest.

Afonso was convinced. He banished his mother to a convent and made Count of Castelo Melhor his secret notary (escrivão da puridade), position in which the favorite was able to exercise the functions of first minister. The new leader of Portugal continued the successes in war against Spain, but he was unable to maintain the internal stability. Without a strong central figure from the royal family, Count's authority began to erode as various political factions struggled for power. Count of Castelo Melhor was deposed and exiled in 1667, shortly before Afonso himself suffered the same fate.

The Paulistas derisively termed the newcomers ''emboabas'' (birds with feathered legs) and regarded them with contempt since they were unfamiliar with life in the Brazilian hinterlands and were competitors for the gold that had been originally claimed by the Paulistas. The massive influx of people into an area that was essentially totally undeveloped before gold was discovered caused prices for the necessities of life to skyrocket, another bone of contention. Tensions were high between the two groups, but open conflict didn't break out until November of 1708 when the Paulista José Pardo was lynched. The emboabas attempted to disarm the Pauistas and evict them entirely from the gold regions. Their leader, Nunes Viana, even began to fill government post, pending the arrival of royal nominees. This alarmed the Governor of Rio de Janiero who arrived in Minas Gerais with a small escort of troops to investigate the disturbances. He generally supported the Paulistas as having legitimate grievances, but the emboabas forced him to return to Rio without settling the major issues. Lisbon ordered the new governor of Rio de Janiero, António de Albuquerque, to proclaim a general amnesty in the hopes of quelling the disturbances. This worked reasonably well, but Paulista hotheads gather forces for one last effort to retake the goldfields on 14 November 1709. They failed, not least to a warning of the impending attack by Albuquerque, and returned home to find a personal appeal by the King, D. João V, to give over their struggle.

Portugal had initial agreements with France, but in 1703, due to commercial interests and the possibility of expanding the borders of Brazil, and seeing the course of war turning in favor of the Grand alliance, Portugal signed the treaties of Methuen with England, entering the war on her side. The main purpose of the treaty was to allow free introduction of English wool and cloths to Portugal in exchange of free entry of Portuguese wine into England (Port wine). The treaty made in effect Portugal an economic and political satellite of England, was effectively in place all the way to 1750, when King D José I choose to ignore it, even while it was still formally in effect until 1836. The participation of Portugal in the war was deemed very important, as it allowed the opening of the Western front in Spain to the invasion by Anglo-Portuguese troops.

The resulting flood of immigrants exacerbated tensions between the sugar-planters in Olinda, the provincial capital of Pernambuco and the merchants, many of them of them recent immigrants themselves, of the thriving port city of Recife. The latter, derisively termed 'mascates', or peddlars by the planters, resented the fact that they had no say in even their local government because Recife wasn't legally a separate city and fell under the control of Olinda. The proclamation of the royal decree granting municipal status to Recife by the governor, Sebastiao de Castro e Caldas, in February and March of 1710 was seen as a threat to the dominance of Olinda and its controlling oligarchy of sugar-planters. This was exacerbated by D. Joao V's failure to deliniate the boundaries of Recife, leaving it for the governor and the ouvidor (crown judge) to settle the boundaries between them. De Castro e Caldas awarded three parishes to Recife over the protests of the ouvidor and the town council and arrested the deputation that made the protests. This high-handed act triggered almost half a decade of unrest between partisans of each side, to include sporadic armed conflict between the garrison of Recife and the Olinda milita.

	#-#After the signing of the second treaty of San Ildefonso, France started to pressure Spain to collaborate in an invasion of Portugal to dislodge her from her alliance with England. Carlos IV was the father-in-law of Joao VI, prince of Brazil and regent of Portugal, and did not desire a conflict, but French pressure was too strong. Joao could not accept Napoléon's demands of ceding a quarter of his territory to Spain as a guarantee, and so the war became inevitable. On May 20, 1801, Godoy invaded Portugal from three points, and in nine days completely defeated the Portuguese army, before the French army sent to participate in the campaign could cross Spain. Godoy sent a branch of an orange tree from the moat of Elvas to his Queen and lover, and hence the name of the war. But Carlos IV had no intention of leaving Portugal in the hands of Napoléon, and against his instructions, signed the treaty of Badajoz with Joao. It was a very favorable treaty for Portugal, who had to pay indemnities to France, close her ports to British ships, cede a small part of the Guiana to France, and the small town of Olivenza to Spain. The treaty was signed on the 8th of June, but dated on the 6th, so Carlos could ignore Napoléon's instructions received on the 7th. Napoléon was furious and did not ratify the treaty until the 29th of September.

He established a military council to propose reforms although political difficulties delayed the reorganization until 1806. It divided up the country into three divisions, Northern, Central and Southern. Every unit was assigned to one of these divisions. The size of the Regular Army remained the same, but militia regiments were increased to 48 from 43 and the Ordenança companies were organized into 24 brigades. The Ordenança brigades acted as a recruiting depot and reserve for a regiment of the line and two militia regiments. Enlisted men released after their service with a regular infantry or militia unit were obligated to serve another eight years in their Ordenança brigade. These reforms had only been partially implemented when the French invaded in 1807, but they were fully implemented by 1812.
