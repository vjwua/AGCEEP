	#-#Since the fall of the Roman Empire the title of King of Italy was sometimes used by the barbarians chiefs who ruled over the Italian peninsula until the end of the Gothic Wars and the following invasion of the Lombards, who established their own Kingdom in 568, thus separating northern Italy from the territories controlled by the Eastern Roman Empire. In 774 Pope Adrianus I, threatened by a renewed Lombard claim to the Patrimomium Petri (also know as the Duchy of Rome), called Charlemagne in Italy to protect him, thus granting the Frankish King possession of the conquered Kingdom of Lombards and the Duchy of Spoleto as its vassal in exchange for the cession to the Pope of some Lombard held territories,the future Papal States. Venice, who nominally recognized the Byzantine sovereignty, and the southernmost Lombard Duchy of Benevento were granted independence. In 781 Charlemagne's son Pippin became the first King of Italy crowned by a Pope with the Corona Ferrea (iron crown) so called from a narrow band of iron within it, said to be beaten out of one of the nails used at the Crucifixion. Even if the Empire had usually suffered dynastic and feudal disputes, only after 888, with the extinction of the Carolingian dynasty and the anarchy that followed, were the throne of Italy and the Imperial title continuously contended for by several claimants. And when in 962 Berengar, Marquis of Ivrea, one of the self-proclaimed Kings of Italy of those times, audaciously tried to seize the Papal States, Pope Johannes XII, as his predecessor did with the Franks before, invited Otto I, Duke of Saxony and King of the Germans, to come to Italy and protect him in exchange for the title of Holy Roman Emperor (translatio imperii). Since then, excluding the short period between 1002 and 1015 during which Arduino, Margrave of Ivrea, unsuccessfully tried to proclaim himself King of Italy and was then forced to abandon his claims, the 'Regnum Italicum' (the Kingdom of Italy) has been subsumed into the Holy Roman Empire. And now, after a period of great expansion, we have finally gained dominance over the lands representing the medieval Kingdom of Italy. But in order to be acknowledged Kings of Italy, we would need the official recognition of the Holy Roman Emperor, who holds the rights to the title, or the Pope, who could crown us against the will of the Emperor. Our great relations and alliance with the Pope makes it possible that he will grant us the crown. We will offer him 100 ducats to help his Holiness go against the will of the Emperor.

	#-#Since the fall of the Roman Empire the title of King of Italy was sometimes used by the barbarians chiefs who ruled over the Italian peninsula until the end of the Gothic Wars and the following invasion of the Lombards, who established their own Kingdom in 568, thus separating northern Italy from the territories controlled by the Eastern Roman Empire. In 774 Pope Adrianus I, threatened by a renewed Lombard claim to the Patrimomium Petri (also know as the Duchy of Rome), called Charlemagne in Italy to protect him, thus granting the Frankish King possession of the conquered Kingdom of Lombards and the Duchy of Spoleto as its vassal in exchange for the cession to the Pope of some Lombard held territories,the future Papal States. Venice, who nominally recognized the Byzantine sovereignty, and the southernmost Lombard Duchy of Benevento were granted independence. In 781 Charlemagne's son Pippin became the first King of Italy crowned by a Pope with the Corona Ferrea (iron crown) so called from a narrow band of iron within it, said to be beaten out of one of the nails used at the Crucifixion. Even if the Empire had usually suffered dynastic and feudal disputes, only after 888, with the extinction of the Carolingian dynasty and the anarchy that followed, were the throne of Italy and the Imperial title continuously contended for by several claimants. And when in 962 Berengar, Marquis of Ivrea, one of the self-proclaimed Kings of Italy of those times, audaciously tried to seize the Papal States, Pope Johannes XII, as his predecessor did with the Franks before, invited Otto I, Duke of Saxony and King of the Germans, to come to Italy and protect him in exchange for the title of Holy Roman Emperor (translatio imperii). Since then, excluding the short period between 1002 and 1015 during which Arduino, Margrave of Ivrea, unsuccessfully tried to proclaim himself King of Italy and was then forced to abandon his claims, the 'Regnum Italicum' (the Kingdom of Italy) has been subsumed into the Holy Roman Empire. And now, after a period of great expansion, we have finally gained dominance over the lands representing the medieval Kingdom of Italy. But in order to be acknowledged Kings of Italy, we would need the official recognition of the Holy Roman Emperor, who holds the rights to the title, or the Pope. Our great relations and alliance with the Habsburgs makes it possible that they will grant us the crown. We will offer the Emperor lavish gifts worth 500 ducats to convince him to hand over the title.

	#-#Since the fall of the Roman Empire the title of King of Italy was sometimes used by the barbarians chiefs who ruled over the Italian peninsula until the end of the Gothic Wars and the following invasion of the Lombards, who established their own Kingdom in 568, thus separating northern Italy from the territories controlled by the Eastern Roman Empire. In 774 Pope Adrianus I, threatened by a renewed Lombard claim to the Patrimomium Petri (also know as the Duchy of Rome), called Charlemagne in Italy to protect him, thus granting the Frankish King possession of the conquered Kingdom of Lombards and the Duchy of Spoleto as its vassal in exchange for the cession to the Pope of some Lombard held territories,the future Papal States. Venice, who nominally recognized the Byzantine sovereignty, and the southernmost Lombard Duchy of Benevento were granted independence. In 781 Charlemagne's son Pippin became the first King of Italy crowned by a Pope with the Corona Ferrea (iron crown) so called from a narrow band of iron within it, said to be beaten out of one of the nails used at the Crucifixion. Even if the Empire had usually suffered dynastic and feudal disputes, only after 888, with the extinction of the Carolingian dynasty and the anarchy that followed, were the throne of Italy and the Imperial title continuously contended for by several claimants. And when in 962 Berengar, Marquis of Ivrea, one of the self-proclaimed Kings of Italy of those times, audaciously tried to seize the Papal States, Pope Johannes XII, as his predecessor did with the Franks before, invited Otto I, Duke of Saxony and King of the Germans, to come to Italy and protect him in exchange for the title of Holy Roman Emperor (translatio imperii). Since then, excluding the short period between 1002 and 1015 during which Arduino, Margrave of Ivrea, unsuccessfully tried to proclaim himself King of Italy and was then forced to abandon his claims, the 'Regnum Italicum' (the Kingdom of Italy) has been subsumed into the Holy Roman Empire. And now, after a period of great expansion, we have finally gained dominance over the lands representing the medieval Kingdom of Italy. Having also vassalized Austria and put the Pope under our boot, there is now no obstacle in our path to claim the crown of the Kingdom of Italy as part of the Holy Roman Empire. Shall we start preparations for the coronation?

	#-#Since the fall of the Roman Empire the title of King of Italy was sometimes used by the barbarians chiefs who ruled over the Italian peninsula until the end of the Gothic Wars and the following invasion of the Lombards, who established their own Kingdom in 568, thus separating northern Italy from the territories controlled by the Eastern Roman Empire. In 774 Pope Adrianus I, threatened by a renewed Lombard claim to the Patrimomium Petri (also know as the Duchy of Rome), called Charlemagne in Italy to protect him, thus granting the Frankish King possession of the conquered Kingdom of Lombards and the Duchy of Spoleto as its vassal in exchange for the cession to the Pope of some Lombard held territories,the future Papal States. Venice, who nominally recognized the Byzantine sovereignty, and the southernmost Lombard Duchy of Benevento were granted independence. In 781 Charlemagne's son Pippin became the first King of Italy crowned by a Pope with the Corona Ferrea (iron crown) so called from a narrow band of iron within it, said to be beaten out of one of the nails used at the Crucifixion. Even if the Empire had usually suffered dynastic and feudal disputes, only after 888, with the extinction of the Carolingian dynasty and the anarchy that followed, were the throne of Italy and the Imperial title continuously contended for by several claimants. And when in 962 Berengar, Marquis of Ivrea, one of the self-proclaimed Kings of Italy of those times, audaciously tried to seize the Papal States, Pope Johannes XII, as his predecessor did with the Franks before, invited Otto I, Duke of Saxony and King of the Germans, to come to Italy and protect him in exchange for the title of Holy Roman Emperor (translatio imperii). Since then, excluding the short period between 1002 and 1015 during which Arduino, Margrave of Ivrea, unsuccessfully tried to proclaim himself King of Italy and was then forced to abandon his claims, the 'Regnum Italicum' (the Kingdom of Italy) has been subsumed into the Holy Roman Empire. And now, after a period of great expansion, we have finally gained dominance over the lands representing the medieval Kingdom of Italy. But in order to be acknowledged Kings of Italy, we would need the official recognition of the Holy Roman Emperor, who holds the rights to the title, or the Pope, who could crown us against the will of the Emperor. Our great relations and alliance with the Pope makes it possible that he will grant us the crown. We will offer him 100 ducats to help his Holiness go against the will of the Emperor.

	#-#Since the fall of the Roman Empire the title of King of Italy was sometimes used by the barbarians chiefs who ruled over the Italian peninsula until the end of the Gothic Wars and the following invasion of the Lombards, who established their own Kingdom in 568, thus separating northern Italy from the territories controlled by the Eastern Roman Empire. In 774 Pope Adrianus I, threatened by a renewed Lombard claim to the Patrimomium Petri (also know as the Duchy of Rome), called Charlemagne in Italy to protect him, thus granting the Frankish King possession of the conquered Kingdom of Lombards and the Duchy of Spoleto as its vassal in exchange for the cession to the Pope of some Lombard held territories,the future Papal States. Venice, who nominally recognized the Byzantine sovereignty, and the southernmost Lombard Duchy of Benevento were granted independence. In 781 Charlemagne's son Pippin became the first King of Italy crowned by a Pope with the Corona Ferrea (iron crown) so called from a narrow band of iron within it, said to be beaten out of one of the nails used at the Crucifixion. Even if the Empire had usually suffered dynastic and feudal disputes, only after 888, with the extinction of the Carolingian dynasty and the anarchy that followed, were the throne of Italy and the Imperial title continuously contended for by several claimants. And when in 962 Berengar, Marquis of Ivrea, one of the self-proclaimed Kings of Italy of those times, audaciously tried to seize the Papal States, Pope Johannes XII, as his predecessor did with the Franks before, invited Otto I, Duke of Saxony and King of the Germans, to come to Italy and protect him in exchange for the title of Holy Roman Emperor (translatio imperii). Since then, excluding the short period between 1002 and 1015 during which Arduino, Margrave of Ivrea, unsuccessfully tried to proclaim himself King of Italy and was then forced to abandon his claims, the 'Regnum Italicum' (the Kingdom of Italy) has been subsumed into the Holy Roman Empire. And now, after a period of great expansion, we have finally gained dominance over the lands representing the medieval Kingdom of Italy.

	#-#Since the fall of the Roman Empire the title of King of Italy was sometimes used by the barbarians chiefs who ruled over the Italian peninsula until the end of the Gothic Wars and the following invasion of the Lombards, who established their own Kingdom in 568, thus separating northern Italy from the territories controlled by the Eastern Roman Empire. In 774 Pope Adrianus I, threatened by a renewed Lombard claim to the Patrimomium Petri (also know as the Duchy of Rome), called Charlemagne in Italy to protect him, thus granting the Frankish King possession of the conquered Kingdom of Lombards and the Duchy of Spoleto as its vassal in exchange for the cession to the Pope of some Lombard held territories,the future Papal States. Venice, who nominally recognized the Byzantine sovereignty, and the southernmost Lombard Duchy of Benevento were granted independence. In 781 Charlemagne's son Pippin became the first King of Italy crowned by a Pope with the Corona Ferrea (iron crown) so called from a narrow band of iron within it, said to be beaten out of one of the nails used at the Crucifixion. Even if the Empire had usually suffered dynastic and feudal disputes, only after 888, with the extinction of the Carolingian dynasty and the anarchy that followed, were the throne of Italy and the Imperial title continuously contended for by several claimants. And when in 962 Berengar, Marquis of Ivrea, one of the self-proclaimed Kings of Italy of those times, audaciously tried to seize the Papal States, Pope Johannes XII, as his predecessor did with the Franks before, invited Otto I, Duke of Saxony and King of the Germans, to come to Italy and protect him in exchange for the title of Holy Roman Emperor (translatio imperii). Since then, excluding the short period between 1002 and 1015 during which Arduino, Margrave of Ivrea, unsuccessfully tried to proclaim himself King of Italy and was then forced to abandon his claims, the 'Regnum Italicum' (the Kingdom of Italy) has been subsumed into the Holy Roman Empire. And now, after a period of great expansion, we have finally gained dominance over the lands representing the medieval Kingdom of Italy. But in order to be acknowledged Kings of Italy, we would need the official recognition of the Holy Roman Emperor, who holds the rights to the title, or the Pope. Our great relations and alliance with the Habsburgs makes it possible that they will grant us the crown. We will offer the Emperor lavish gifts worth 500 ducats to convince him to hand over the title.

	#-#Since the fall of the Roman Empire the title of King of Italy was sometimes used by the barbarians chiefs who ruled over the Italian peninsula until the end of the Gothic Wars and the following invasion of the Lombards, who established their own Kingdom in 568, thus separating northern Italy from the territories controlled by the Eastern Roman Empire. In 774 Pope Adrianus I, threatened by a renewed Lombard claim to the Patrimomium Petri (also know as the Duchy of Rome), called Charlemagne in Italy to protect him, thus granting the Frankish King possession of the conquered Kingdom of Lombards and the Duchy of Spoleto as its vassal in exchange for the cession to the Pope of some Lombard held territories,the future Papal States. Venice, who nominally recognized the Byzantine sovereignty, and the southernmost Lombard Duchy of Benevento were granted independence. In 781 Charlemagne's son Pippin became the first King of Italy crowned by a Pope with the Corona Ferrea (iron crown) so called from a narrow band of iron within it, said to be beaten out of one of the nails used at the Crucifixion. Even if the Empire had usually suffered dynastic and feudal disputes, only after 888, with the extinction of the Carolingian dynasty and the anarchy that followed, were the throne of Italy and the Imperial title continuously contended for by several claimants. And when in 962 Berengar, Marquis of Ivrea, one of the self-proclaimed Kings of Italy of those times, audaciously tried to seize the Papal States, Pope Johannes XII, as his predecessor did with the Franks before, invited Otto I, Duke of Saxony and King of the Germans, to come to Italy and protect him in exchange for the title of Holy Roman Emperor (translatio imperii). Since then, excluding the short period between 1002 and 1015 during which Arduino, Margrave of Ivrea, unsuccessfully tried to proclaim himself King of Italy and was then forced to abandon his claims, the 'Regnum Italicum' (the Kingdom of Italy) has been subsumed into the Holy Roman Empire. And now, after a period of great expansion, we have finally gained dominance over the lands representing the medieval Kingdom of Italy. But in order to be acknowledged Kings of Italy, we would need the official recognition of the Holy Roman Emperor, who holds the rights to the title, or the Pope, who could crown us against the will of the Emperor. Our great relations and alliance with the Pope makes it possible that he will grant us the crown. We will offer him 100 ducats to help his Holiness go against the will of the Emperor.

In 781 Charlemagne's son Pippin became the first King of Italy crowned by a Pope with the Corona Ferrea (iron crown) so called from a narrow band of iron within it, said to be beaten out of one of the nails used at the Crucifixion. Even if the Empire had usually suffered dynastic and feudal disputes, only after 888, with the extinction of the Carolingian dynasty and the anarchy that followed, were the throne of Italy and the Imperial title continuously contended for by several claimants. And when in 962 Berengar, Marquis of Ivrea, one of the self-proclaimed Kings of Italy of those times, audaciously tried to seize the Papal States, Pope Johannes XII, as his predecessor did with the Franks before, invited Otto I, Duke of Saxony and King of the Germans, to come to Italy and protect him in exchange for the title of Holy Roman Emperor (translatio imperii). Since then, excluding the short period between 1002 and 1015 during which Arduino, Margrave of Ivrea, unsuccessfully tried to proclaim himself King of Italy and was then forced to abandon his claims, the 'Regnum Italicum' (the Kingdom of Italy) has been subsumed into the Holy Roman Empire. And now, after a period of great expansion, we have finally gained dominance over the lands representing the medieval Kingdom of Italy. Having also vassalized Austria and put the Pope under our boot, there is now no obstacle in our path to claim the crown of the Kingdom of Italy as part of the Holy Roman Empire. Shall we start preparations for the coronation?

In 774 Pope Adrianus I, threatened by a renewed Lombard claim to the Patrimomium Petri (also know as the Duchy of Rome), called Charlemagne in Italy to protect him, thus granting the Frankish King possession of the conquered Kingdom of Lombards and the Duchy of Spoleto as its vassal in exchange for the cession to the Pope of some Lombard held territories,the future Papal States. Venice, who nominally recognized the Byzantine sovereignty, and the southernmost Lombard Duchy of Benevento were granted independence. In 781 Charlemagne's son Pippin became the first King of Italy crowned by a Pope with the Corona Ferrea (iron crown) so called from a narrow band of iron within it, said to be beaten out of one of the nails used at the Crucifixion. Even if the Empire had usually suffered dynastic and feudal disputes, only after 888, with the extinction of the Carolingian dynasty and the anarchy that followed, were the throne of Italy and the Imperial title continuously contended for by several claimants. And when in 962 Berengar, Marquis of Ivrea, one of the self-proclaimed Kings of Italy of those times, audaciously tried to seize the Papal States, Pope Johannes XII, as his predecessor did with the Franks before, invited Otto I, Duke of Saxony and King of the Germans, to come to Italy and protect him in exchange for the title of Holy Roman Emperor (translatio imperii). Since then, excluding the short period between 1002 and 1015 during which Arduino, Margrave of Ivrea, unsuccessfully tried to proclaim himself King of Italy and was then forced to abandon his claims, the 'Regnum Italicum' (the Kingdom of Italy) has been subsumed into the Holy Roman Empire. And now, after a period of great expansion, we have finally gained dominance over the lands representing the medieval Kingdom of Italy. But in order to be acknowledged Kings of Italy, we would need the official recognition of the Holy Roman Emperor, who holds the rights to the title, or the Pope, who could crown us against the will of the Emperor. Our great relations and alliance with the Pope makes it possible that he will grant us the crown. We will offer him 100 ducats to help his Holiness go against the will of the Emperor.

He determined experimentally that objects do not fall with velocities proportionate to their weight that was a direct contradiction of the teachings of Aristotle. In 1609 he built a telescope and began detailed observations of the sky. However his disagreements with the Aristotelean canon made his life at the University of Padua increasingly difficult as he met accusations from the Church and the opposition of detractors at the University. In 1610 the King invited him to come to the capital and continue his work away from his opponents.

Charles set up a printing press in his own palace to make the new legislation known, and subjected the clergy to rigourous examinations. He reformed the education system of Milan, making it far better than it was before. His reforms, however, conflicted with the secular authourities of Milan, as well as some of the unreformist clergy. He was canonized in 1614.

	#-#It is believed to be the Jesus' burial shroud. The known provenance of this cloth dates to 1357, when the widow of the French knight Geoffroy de Charny had it displayed in a church at Lirey, France. During the fourteenth century, the Shroud was often publicly exposed, though not continuously, and also denounced as a fraud but indulgences for pilgrimages to see the Shroud were however prescribed by the Antipope Clement VII. In 1418, in order to provide protection against criminal bands the Lirey canons handed the Shroud over to Humbert of Villersexel, Marguerite of Charny's husband, who moved it to his castle at Montfort and later to Saint-Hippolyte-sur-Doubs, in his estates. After Humbert's death, his widow kept the Shroud in spite of claims of ownership by the canons of Lirey and travelled with it to various expositions, notably in Lige and Geneva. In 1453 in Geneva, she sold the image to Louis I of Savoy in exchange for a castle in Varambon. Louis of Savoy, the new owner, stored the Shroud in Chambry in the newly-built Sainte Chapelle, which Pope Paul II shortly thereafter raised to the dignity of a collegiate church. In 1464, by an accord drawn up in Paris Louis I agreed to pay an annual fee to the Lirey canons in exchange for their dropping claims of ownership of the cloth. The accord specifically noted that the Shroud had been given to the church of Lirey by Geoffrey de Charny, lord of Savoisy and Lirey, and that it had then been transferred to Louis of Savoy by Marguerite de Charny. That agreement finally legitimated the House of Savoy to own the sacred 'Sindon'.

Beginning in 1471, the Shroud was moved between many cities of Savoy and Piedmont and also housed there briefly. In 1532 the Shroud suffered damage from a fire in the chapel where it was stored in Chambry. A drop of molten silver from the reliquary produced a symmetrically-placed mark through the layers of the folded cloth. Chambry's poor Clare Nuns attempted to repair this damage with patches. In 1578, after having been continuously transferred from one place to another for protection against war devastations, the Shroud arrived at last to its final destination, the Cathedral of Turin. Since then the Shroud was frequently carried out in religious processions and also brought in public exhibitions as well as in private showings only for the most notable people. Turin became an important centre of Christian pilgrimage.

The excitement was appeased by Giovanni de' Medici, who said, It is not well to go into things so long past, unless to learn something for our present guidance, and if in former times the taxation has been unjust, we ought to be thankful, that we have now discovered a method of making it equitable, and hope that this will be the means of uniting the citizens, not of dividing them, which would certainly be the case were they to attempt the recovery of taxes for the past, and make them equal to the present, and that he who is content with a moderate victory is always most successful, for those who would more than conquer, commonly lose.

	#-#In 1764, Cesare Bonesana, Marquis of Beccaria, published a brief but justly celebrated treatise, 'Dei Delitti e delle Pene' (On Crimes and Punishments), which marked the high point of the Milan Enlightenment. In it, Beccaria put forth the first arguments ever made against the death penalty. His treatise was also the first full work of penology, advocating reform of the criminal law system. Apart from condemning the death penalty (on two grounds: first, because the state does not possess the right to take lives and secondly, because capital punishment is neither a useful nor a necessary form of punishment), Beccaria developed in his treatise a number of innovative and influential principles: punishment had a preventive, not a retributive, function, punishment should be proportionate to the crime committed, the certainty of punishment, not its severity, would achieve the preventive effect, procedures of criminal convictions should be public and finally, in order to be effective, punishment should be prompt. The book was the first full-scale work to tackle criminal reform and to suggest that criminal justice should conform to rational principles. In this, Beccaria reflected the convictions of the 'Il Caff' group, who sought to cause reform through Enlightenment discourse. Put across in a clear and animated style, the book's serious message was based in particular upon a deep sense of humanity and of urgency at unjust suffering. This humane sentiment was what made Beccaria appeal for rationality in the laws. In 1786 Pietro Leopoldo of Habsburg-Lorraine was the first European monarch to reform the penal code with his 'Codice Leopoldino', he but followed Beccaria's argument about the lack of utility of capital punishment, not about the state's lacking right to execute citizens.
