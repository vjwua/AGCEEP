Basarab I (133052) defeated the Hungarian King Charles I Robert in 1330 and secured Wallachian independence. However, it proved short-lived. In 1391 Prince Mircea the Old (13861418) was obliged to pay tribute to the Turks, and in 1417 he acknowledged Ottoman suzerainty. Wallachia was allowed to retain its own dynasty, territory and religion but was obliged to pay tribute to the Sultan and act in accordance with his wishes. However, some of its subsequent princes revived Wallachia's resistance - notably Vlad III the Impaler ('Dracula') and Michael the Brave (15931601), who briefly united Wallachia with Moldavia and Transylvania. The German and Hungarian inhabitants were not really enthusiastic seeing themselves become part of a Romanian principality and losing their dominant position.

The accord was developed after Christopher of Bavaria crushed a great peasant uprising in Northern Jutland. The treaty broke the attempted monopoly of Baltic trading routes by the Hanseatic League. Even though Hanseatic trade regulations did not change, the Dutch (with their larger trading vessels) increased their control on herring fisheries, the French salt trade, and the Baltic grain trade. In short, the Baltic Sea was open and influenced by Dutch traders. The Hanseatic merchants eventually became middlemen whereby they transported bulk goods (i.e. lumber, grain, fish) from the Baltic and exchanged them for textiles and other finished products. The treaty did not affect the control of Hanse trading outposts in London, Bruges, Danzig, and Bergen. Based on the terms of the agreement, Dutch towns promised to pay or return twenty-two lost Prussian and Livonian ships. Moreover, the Dutch would pay 5,000 guldens to the Danish King to maintain their trading privileges in Denmark, as well as pay the damages they made to Wendish towns.

He has been noticed by the King Ferdinand of Aragon during the Reconquista, by his use of powder during sieges, as much for blowing mines as for cannons. In 1496, soon after the French loot of the village of Salses at the border of Roussillon and its old Middle Age castle, Ferdinand ordered him to build a modern fortress. He built it from 1497 to 1503 using innovative principles, inspired from Italy, in order to protect the fortress from the artillery and to optimize the fire of the cannons from the castle. This fort was considered as impregnable with his 15m thick walls at the base. It was supposed to have a 3,000 men garrison (that it never had) and till our days it surprises us by its size, its short shape, its surrounding ditches, half-moons and counterscarps. \n \nIn 1503, Francisco Ramiro also participated to the construction of the military port of Collioure, at the Pyrenees feet, inspiring himself from his work in Salses. The castle of Salses, taken by the French in 1639, taken back in 1640 and once again conquered in 1642 would be later hardly improved by Sébastien Vauban's works. The fort lost of its importance after 1659 when the border went to the Pyrenean range. \n \nIf Francisco Ramiro Lopez' work has been an important step in military architecture, he never had the intuition of the earth ramparts. On the contrary, he preferred the systematic use of stones and mortar and it is in Italy, at Civita Vecchia in 1508, that the first earth bastion was built. So, later, it would be mainly Italians architects that Carlos V would use to build his fortresses.

	#-#Horrified by the bloody pagan beliefs of the Aztecs, and wishing to impose Catholicism on their new subjects, the Spaniards systematically destroyed the Aztec temples. One of the hundreds of temples destroyed was the temple of the goddess Tonantzin, located on Tepeyac Hill. Tonantzin was a manifestation dedicated to childbirth of the Earth Mother (Coatlicue). In 1521 the Aztec Quauhtlatoatzin was baptized by Franciscans and named Juan Diego. Between December 9 and 12, 1531, the Virgin of Guadalupe appeared at Tepeyac Hill four times to him speaking in Náhuatl, and performed the miracle of growing Spanish roses in winter and imprinting her image in his apron. The natives identified this dark skinned Virgin, that spoke Náhuatl with the goddess Tonantzin. The possibility of fusing their pre-Hispanic beliefs with the new religion triggered the massive conversion of millions of Aztecs. The first chuch was built in Tepeyac in 1533, in what is today the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe. She was declared Patron of Mexico in 1737 and chosen as symbol for the independence of Mexico in 1810. Juan Diego died on May 30, 1548 and was beatified in 1990 and canonized in 2002 by Pope John Paul II.

They believed in a supreme god, practiced praying and forgiveness of sins by priests, and believed in an afterlife to be won after a just life. Moreover they were used to the cult of the sun being imposed over conquered cultures as a top layer. The Catholic Church of Perú therefore did not have much problem in being accepted as the supreme religion, even though from the first Council of Lima in 1551, it declared that nobody could be forced to convert. In the second Council of Lima in 1567, that was called to adapt to the Council of Trent, further measures to promote evangelization were taken. The use of aboriginal languages by priests was recommended, together with rules on how to enhance the dignity and moral customs of the natives, including personal hygiene recommendations. The third Council of Lima, carried out in 1582 under the direction of St. Toribio, resulted in the translation of the Catechism to quechua and aymara, and in a strong defense of the Indians against injustices. As a result of the Church efforts, by the end of the XVI century the Incas had been fully converted, at least in appearance.

	#-#In the XVIth century if the city was losing its central role politically, demographically it was continually expanding. With over 175,000 inhabitants it was one of the most densely-populated cities in the world. Venice, being protected by the lagoon and because of its merchant nature, had recurrent pestilences, and drinking water was so scarce in the city and of such bad quality, that those that could afford it drank almost exclusively watered wine. The nobility took refuge in their villas in Terraferma when pestilences hit, while most Doges made a point of honor to remain in the city, and several of them died of plagues. In the three years between 1575 and 1577 the Serenissima was tormented by the plague: aided by the high density of the population, the disease spread through the city, causing terrible losses, with a dramatic new outbreak in the summer of the second year. Almost 50,000 died, which was more than a third of the city's inhabitants. Due mainly to promiscuity and precarious living conditions, the disease spread almost exclusively among the poorer classes. Initially the seriousness of the epidemic was played down, but as the disease spread the government was forced to adopt extreme hygiene and sanitary regulations which helped to eradicate the disease after the first dramatic months. The Senate decided that the Doge should announce the vow to erect a church dedicated to the Redentore (Redeemer), in return for help in ending the plague. With the plague not yet officially eradicated, the first stone of Palladio's votive church was laid. On 13 July 1577 the plague was declared definitively over and it was decided that the city's liberation from the terrible disease should be celebrated on the third Sunday in July for years to come.

The following year, Nurhaci began to unify the Jurchen bands around his area. In 1584, when he was 25, he attacked Nikan Wailan at Tulun (village in Liaoning too) to avenge the deaths of his father and grandfather, who are said to have left him nothing but thirteen suits of armor. Nikan Wailan fled away to Erhun, which got attacked by Nurhaci again in 1587. Nikan Wailan this time fled to Li Chengliang's territory. Later, as a way to build relationship, Li gave Nikan Wailan to Nurhaci, who beheaded Nikan Wailan immediately. With Li's support, Nurhaci gradually grew his strength in the following years.

Using this discovery to promote his own personal advancement, he captured the pagan high priest, Hernando Paucar, and on December 20, 1609 he conducted a gigantic ''Auto de Fe'' at Lima, where old mummies and idols where destroyed, and Paucar flogged. Afterwards he was named visitador (traveling judge) of idolatry, conducting the first of several campaigns to destroy altars and idols and attempt to erradicate idolatry that would last until 1670.

The first expeditions were successful in bypassing Portuguese dominion of the Cape of Good Hope and the Indian Ocean in general. The Dutch also managed to break the Portuguese monopoly of the spice trade. As the Dutch fleets grew in size, so did their interference with Portuguese trade, and the first skirmishes took place. By 1619, the Dutch conquered Jayakarta which they rename Batavia and make it their EastIndies capital. For the next twenty years the two cities of Goa and Batavia would fight each other relentlessly, since they stood as the capital of the Portuguese India State (or the Indian Vice-Royalty) and the Dutch EastIndia Company's base of operations.

He sent a letter to the Governor of Taiwan in August 1655. The Spanish, wrote Chenggong, had been mistreating his sailors, and he had therefore issued an edict that forbade Chinese to sail to Manila on pain of death. He enclosed a copy of the edict and requested that the Governor propagate it in Formosa and enforce it by confiscating the junks and property of any who disobeyed. But the language of the edict raised the hackles of the Europeans. First, it said that they ''behave more like animals than Christians.'' Second, it referred to Chinese who lived in the colony as Chenggong's subjects. Third, and most important, it threatened punishment not only for Chinese but also for ''anyone outside of our nation who extends money for trade with Manila.'' They replied with a ''compliment letter,'' which politely declined his request. The end result of this was a lot fewer junks calling at Manila.

If company officials did as Chenggong asked and published the edict, they would be admitting that Chenggong had sovereignty over the Chinese colonists in Formosa. The Governor and the council decided they must refuse Chenggong's request to preserve ''their sovereignty.'' They replied with a ''compliment letter,'' which politely declined his request. A small fleet was sent to the coast of China, but they found no sign of preparations for invasion. However, Zheng seems to have intimidated many of the Chinese merchants who normally came to trade in Taiwan because very few would brave his displeasure over the next few years.

Thirteen women and five men from all stations of life followed her to the gallows on three successive hanging days before the court was disbanded by Governor William Phipps in October of that year. The Superior Court of Judicature, formed to replace the 'witchcraft' court, did not allow spectral evidence. This belief in the power of the accused to use their invisible shapes or spectres to torture their victims had sealed the fates of those tried by the Court of Oyer and Terminer. The new court released those awaiting trial and pardoned those awaiting execution. In effect, the Salem witch trials were over.

For those that escaped it was far from over as a heavy breeze of wind suddenly started to come in over the area beating the small fires into a virtual inferno incinerating thousands. But yet thousands of people would fall victim for the grand tidal wave reaching land just a few minutes later. The death count was estimated to 20.000-40.000 people at the time and given all four elements (wind, fire, earth and water) the explanation ''punishment by god'' was a view widely spread both in Portugal and elsewhere.

	#-#In 1764, Cesare Bonesana, Marquis of Beccaria, published a brief but justly celebrated treatise, 'Dei Delitti e delle Pene' (On Crimes and Punishments), which marked the high point of the Milan Enlightenment. In it, Beccaria put forth the first arguments ever made against the death penalty. His treatise was also the first full work of penology, advocating reform of the criminal law system. Apart from condemning the death penalty (on two grounds: first, because the state does not possess the right to take lives and secondly, because capital punishment is neither a useful nor a necessary form of punishment), Beccaria developed in his treatise a number of innovative and influential principles: punishment had a preventive, not a retributive, function, punishment should be proportionate to the crime committed, the certainty of punishment, not its severity, would achieve the preventive effect, procedures of criminal convictions should be public and finally, in order to be effective, punishment should be prompt. The book was the first full-scale work to tackle criminal reform and to suggest that criminal justice should conform to rational principles. In this, Beccaria reflected the convictions of the 'Il Caffè' group, who sought to cause reform through Enlightenment discourse. Put across in a clear and animated style, the book's serious message was based in particular upon a deep sense of humanity and of urgency at unjust suffering. This humane sentiment was what made Beccaria appeal for rationality in the laws. In 1786 Pietro Leopoldo of Habsburg-Lorraine was the first European monarch to reform the penal code with his 'Codice Leopoldino', he but followed Beccaria's argument about the lack of utility of capital punishment, not about the state's lacking right to execute citizens.

	#-#Móðuharðindin (literally, The Mist Hardships) was a natural disaster in Iceland in the years 1783-1785 following the volcanic eruption of Laki volcano. \n \nThe hardship began with the eruption of the volcano in Lakagígar on June 8, 1783, which was one of the greatest volcanic eruptions in historical times. The eruption devastated Iceland and the environmental effects could be felt in many places of the world due to the severe global meteorological effects of the rising sulphuric fumes. A contemporary account of the eruption can be found in the Eldrit of pastor Jón Steingrímsson, which was printed in 1788. \n \nAfter the volcano erupted, a poisonous mist settled over the entire country, burning up grazing lands and killing cattle. It is believed that 75 percent of all cattle died, and that one out of five Icelanders (approximately 10,000) perished.

In 'Theory of the Earth with Proofs and Illustrations' (1795), Hutton became the first to show that, in general, the Earth changes slowly and uniformly by the same processes which are occurring today. Hutton did not have as much impact as he might have had, as a result of his cumbersome and difficult literary style. Hutton's idea became known as the Uniformitarian Principle, and served as an alternative to Catastrophism. Hutton believed that volcanic processes were the chief agent in rock formation, thus representing the Vulcanist (or Plutonist) view, in contrast to men such as Werner who supported the Neptunist view.

Using this principle, in 1800 he constructed the first battery to produce electricity. Volta's method of stacking round plates of copper and zinc separated by disks of cardboard moistened with salt solution was termed a Voltaic pile. By touching the copper and zinc disks together, Volta showed them to be oppositely charged.

But after its orbit was determined it was clear that it was like a small planet. Piazzi named it Ceres, after the Sicilian goddess of grain. Three other small bodies were discovered in the next few years: Pallas, Vesta and Juno (now we know hundreds of thousands). Ceres was the first discovered object of the asteroid belt. Piazzi was able to make only three observations, but fortuitously, Gauss had recently developed mathematical techniques that allowed the orbit to be calculated with only three observed positions of the body. When the orbit was calculated by Gauss, it showed that Ceres was not a comet, but a new little planet.

In 1801, Gauss developed the method of least squares fitting, the method enabled him to calculate the orbit of the asteroid Ceres, which had been discovered by Piazzi, from only three observations. Gauss published his monumental treatise on celestial mechanics 'Theoria Motus' in 1806. He worked for the Duke of Brunswick, but when he was killed fighting for the Prussian army, Gauss left Brunswick. In 1807 he took up the position of director of the Göttingen observatory.

Due to the difficulty and expense of the Hajj, the annual pilgrimage was small compared to the millions that swell Mecca today. Pilgrims arrived by boat, at Jeddah, and came overland, or joined the annual caravans from Syria or Iraq. The city was small. 18th and 19th century maps and pictures show a small walled city of mud-brick houses crowded around the mosque. \nHowever, once in a while a larger group of pilgrims of a pilgrim of great reputation would make a Hajj, and stimulate the local economy. The most famous of those is probably Mansa Musa, ruler of Mali, in 1324. He was reportedly accompanied by a caravan that included thousands of people and nearly a hundred camels, giving away so much gold that it took over a decade for the economy across North Africa to recover, due to the rapid inflation that it initiated.
