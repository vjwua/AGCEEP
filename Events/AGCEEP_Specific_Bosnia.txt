	#-#The Bogumils were a Christian sect that believed in Dualism. Their teachings had their origin in teachings of early Paulician churches in Asia Minor and in Manicheanism. While Manicheanists believed in two Gods, one evil and one good (violating the Christian view of monotheism), Bogumils believed in one God with two sides, one evil and one good. Satan was the older brother of Jesus and thus as much God as Jesus is. God's evil side (Satanael) was ruling the material world while God's good side was ruling the spiritual world. Thus they believed that all churches were the work of Satanel, so they rejected them. They also rejected the Old Testament, priests' ownership of material things and church sacraments. Because of this they were usually supported by the Bans and Kings of Bosnia. With the Ottoman conquest of Bosnia, most of the Bogumils converted to Islam.

In 1424, a small Ottoman army raided Bosnia as a warning, but this didn't change Tvrtko's mind much. In 1425, Tvrtko II started negotiations with Emperor Sigismund to join the league against Ottomans. He agreed to Sigismund's demand to name Count Hermann of Cilli, one of most powerful Hungarian nobles, as his heir. The alliance with Hungary was delayed, however, because of Hungarian failures against Hussites in Bohemia. After punishing Serbia for dealing with Hungarians, Ottomans sent another raiding expedition into Bosnia in 1426. Determined to ally with Hungary, Tvrtko II named Hermann of Cilli heir to the Bosnian throne if Tvrtko dies without a heir or his heir dies without one. In 1428, Tvrtko II got even closer to his goals by marrying daughter of a Hungarian noble.

	#-#Kingdom of Bosnia was a chaotic realms where dukes constantly battle each other for territories. The most famous rivalry of that age was between Pavlovic and Kosaca families. After a quiet period, the rivalry revived when Duke Radoslav Pavlovic attacked and defeated the Republic of Ragusa because they tried to turn Cavtat, a town they bought from him, into a fortress. Duke Sandalj Hranic Kosaca immediately intervened on Ragusan side and attacked his archrival. King Tvrtko II was mostly helpless to solve the dispute. Since Duke Sandalj had the support of the Ottomans, Duke Radoslav asked Despot Djuradj of Serbia to broker peace. At almost the same time, King Tvrtko II went to war with Zlatonosovic family in eastern Bosnia. Since they were friends of Duke Sandalj and Serbian Despot, King Tvrtko II decided to throw his lot with Duke Radoslav. A real civil war started in Bosnia. As Kings faction began to loose the war, treacherous Duke Radoslav switched sides and joined the Serbian Despot's camp in 1433. This coalition of Serbian Despot and Bosnian Dukes put forth their own candidate for Tvrtko's replacement: Radivoj. The hostilities temporarily ceased when Emperor Sigismund announced his support for King Tvrtko II and Despot Djuradj withdrew from the conflict. Hungarian army arrived as promised in 1434 and changed the tide of the battle. Coalition of rebellious Dukes was defeated and forts held by Ottomans liberated. Duke Sandalj was crushed by Duke Djuradj Vojsalic, who joined forces with King Tvrtko II when Hugarian army arrived, and died from illness in March 1435. King Tvrtko traveled to Hungarty to swear vassalage to Emperor Sigismund. Upon his return to Bosnia, he started a campaign together with Duke Radoslav Pavlovic to destroy Stepan Vukcic, the new Duke Kosaca. King Tvtrko II was also aided by Croatian Prinecs Ivan and Stepan Frankopan who acted on the orders of Emperor Sigismund. Ottomans intervened on the behalf of Stepan Vukcic and reconquered one of the forts in Bosnia holding it against Hungarian troops until the end of the conflict. In 1436, Ivan Frankopan is denied the succession of the estates that belonged to his late father-in-law and switches sides to join Duke Stepan Vukcic. Hungarian army defeated and probably killed Ivan Frankopan. King Tvrtko II realized that he will not be able to expel the Turks from Bosnia and crush Stepan Vukcic, so he renewed his oath to Ottoman Sultan and reconciled with his enemy. Together with Stepan Vukcic and the Ottoman forces, the King turned on Duke Radoslav and utterly defeated him in 1438. It is said that around 16 monasteries and churches were burned during this civil war, and this is only a part of the devastation that was caused.

The last Serbian stronghold in Zeta fell to Stepan Vukcic in 1441, just after the mining town of Novo Brdo fell to Ottomans. Stepan was stopped by Venetian towns in lower Zeta. Agitated by Serbian Despot Djuradj, most Montenegrins joined with Venetian defenders. Only citizens of Bar supported the Bosnian Duke. Stepan was temporarily force to halt his attack on Zeta in 1442 because of rebellion of his closes cousin, Ivan Vukovic, but resumed his operations later in the year. His army was immediately defeated near Bar but Venetians refused to negotiate peace treaty while he still held the town. In December 1442, however, Stepan Vukcic was more successful and made progress all the way to Scutari in the east of Zeta. Duke Stepan was joined by Ottoman troops from Albania in 1443 and also by Montenegrin tribes of Paštrovici and Zacani, but he lost the town of Bar in June that year. In need of naval support, Stepan Vukcic sought help from King Alfons V of Aragon of from Republic of Genoa, archrivals of Venice. He failed to procure aid, however, and lost more towns to Venice in the process. In 1444, Stevan Crnojevic, leader of the rebellious Crnojevic family, betrayed Stepan Vukcic and joned the Venetians.

His lands are even today called Hercegovina after this title.

However, it was delayed first by Ottoman arbiter sent by the Sultan, then by Venetian attack on Ragusa.
