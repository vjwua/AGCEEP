Eberhard Ludwig of Wirtemberg was one of these princes. Despite fighting him in the War of Spanish Succession, he was a great admirer of Louis and his French state, and he attempted to rule in a similar way. In Wirtemberg however, the Estates had a strong influence and extensive privileges since the 16th century, and they were eager to keep this position. Eberhard Ludwig summoned them only once during his reign and thereby simply ignored Wirtemberg's constitution, substantially strengthening his position, but also causing dissent against his rule.

Following Louis' example, he chose a little, insignificant village, Ludwigsburg, close to his capital, Stuttgart, as site for his project. In 1704 the builders Johann Friedrich Nette and Donato Giuseppe Frisoni were recruited for the construction of a castle similar to Versailles. Initially, Nette planed a palace comprising three wings, connected by narrow galleries, around a representative court. Frisoni expanded it by two more side buildings and a magnificent baroque castle church. While thecastle was built, the former village Ludwigsburg was transformed into a representative residential town, also with Nette and Frisoni in charge. Eberhard Ludwig officially moved his residence to Ludwigsburg in 1718.

He established monopolies for leather, wine, tobacco and salt, taking he free trade in salt which had been guaranteed to communities for centuries under state control, and extended the already existing one on manufacturing. At his order, several porcelain and silk factories were built and the first bank in southern Germany founded. These measures were initially quite successful. Süß-Oppenheimer thereby managed to greatly increase the Duke's wealth, to expand his authority and introduce effective control of Wirtemberg's economy. However, he was bitterly opposed by the wealthy classes who feared for the estates' and their own privileges, were generally against a strong central authority and had a certain hostility towards Oppenheimer because he was a Jew and considered a parvenu.

On December 16th 1770 the academy was officially founded as a gardener school, however from the beginning it was to educate officers just as well as gardeners. The classes and the tuition followed strict military principles: drill, permanent supervision and wearing uniforms were forced upon the students. Nevertheless, it soon became a quite famous and highly esteemed institution, emphasizing not only military training, but trying to give the future officers a wide, versatileknowledge. They learned French, Latin, Greek, Italian and High German, were taught artillery theory, engineering, strategy, law and philosophy and additionally got specific professional educations, e.g. forestry, medicine, economy or arts that were supposed to prepare them for their functions as officers, clerks or Ducal artists. Due to this outstanding quality, not only students from Wirtemberg, but from the whole of Germany and from abroad were interested in the school. In order to be able to accomodate them, the academy was moved to Stuttgart and made a residential school. In the next years, it quickly developed from a purely military academy into a more general institution, visited by several famous politicians, scientists, officers and artists, most notably Friedrich Schiller whose work was deeply influenced by his time at the Karlsschule. Acknowledging this, it was transformed to a university called 'Carls Hohe Schule' on February 11th 1782.

Instead of wasting his money for his pleasure, the Duke started to provide funds for viticulture, education and the construction of roads and generally was more dedicated to the administration of his countries.

Corrupt ministers were replaced, some imprisoned dissidents released and former unfair decisions annuled. Therefore Franziska was very popular among the populace despite her illegitimate liaison with the Duke.
