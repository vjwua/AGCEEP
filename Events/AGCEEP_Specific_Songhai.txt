Their religious leaders were the diviners and sorcerors of Songhai's traditional religions but because he was a Songhai prince he was nominally Muslim and gave money to the mosques of Gao. He began his reign by defeating the Dogon and Fulani tribes that were rivals to the Songhai, then drove the Mossi raiders out of the Dendi for good. A brilliant general, in 26 years he fought 32 wars and won them all. Soon, he began to look beyond Gao. The obvious choice was Timbuktu, long the key to control of the valuable gold-salt-ivory trade of West Africa. Sonni Ali sent a message to the governor of Timbuktu asking him to join his empire peacefully.

Women were allowed to walk around unveiled and public ceremonies were a mix of traditional and islamic rituals. His harsh treatment of the ulemas (clerics) of Timbuktu only created more friction in the empire. Ali was succeeded by his son Sonni Baru. Like his father, Baru was Muslim in name only. He said his prayers all at once instead of five times a day and on campaign he simply said the names of the prayers to save time. Finally a group of Muslim officers confronted Baru and demanded he change his ways. He refused only to be faced with a coup d'etat. Sonni Baru fled to a village in the far south and lived his life in exile.

He turned to a famous Islamic scholar, Muhammad Al-Maghili, for advice. In response, Al-Maghili wrote a book entitled 'The Obligations of Princes' in which he advised the King to put to death all those who claimed knowledge of the supernatural, punish men and women who mixed freely on the street and follow the teachings of the Koran regarding hygiene and diet. This strict interpretation of Islamic law was hard for the King to accept. He instituted some changes but never went as far as Al-Maghili wanted him to.

Askia was also using the reforms to systematically remove the surviving members of the Sonni, Dia and Za dynasties, replacing them with his own followers.

The enemy commander, Mansur Pasha, set a trap for the Askia. Upon arriving in Songhai Mansur arranged a meeting with his counterpart to discuss peace. Muhammad Gao unwisely accepted and was assassinated. Songhai forces rallied under the leadership of Askia Nuh, who held out against the Moroccan army for years.
