	#-#In October of 1504, Babur sent messages to Muqim Beg Arghun, telling him to give up Kabul which the latter had usurped from Babur's nephew. Upon approaching the city, Babur ordered his troops to stage manouvers to frighten the town's garrison. His tactics were successful and several days later he peacefully took over the Kingdom of Kabul. Shortly after, Babur would find it ideal to subdue the Afghani tribes on the outskirts of his Kingdom.

In return for Ismail's assistance, Babur permitted Ismail to act as a suzerain over him and his followers. Shah Ismail also reunited Babur with his sister Khanzada, who had been imprisoned by and forced to marry the recently deceased Shaybani. Ismail provided Babur with a large wealth of luxury goods and military assistance, for which Babur reciprocated by adopting the dress and outward customs of the Shi'as. Coins were to be struck in Ismail's name, and the Khutba at the Mosque was also to be read in his name. In effect, Babur was to hold Samarkand as a vassal territority for the Persian Shah, though in Kabul, coins and the Khutba would remain in Babur's name.

His second son, Sultan Mahmud was given Badaskhan, Khultan, Tirmiz, Qunduz, and Hisar. Ulugh Beg, his third, was given Kabul and Ghazni with the fourth, Umar Shaikh as ruler of Ferghana.
