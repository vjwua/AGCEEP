The invasion of the Turks in early 1446 had desolated the land and given the Albanian herdsmen a wider range, forcing the Greek peasants to overcrowd the many Venetian towns. Albanians received favourable terms, for it was Ottoman policy to preserve them as a make-weight to the Greeks. In Morea 60000 peasants were reduced to slavery. It was thus that the Morea became perhaps the most miserable province in the Balkans, nor can there be any doubt but that Mohammad deliberately intended this to be its fate. He unpeopled and desolated it so that it might present no allurements to a foreign invader and have no spirit to be restless.

He allied with Genoa and the Pope, and defeated Demetrios, who fled seeking help from the Ottomans in 1460. The Ottoman army duly attacked Morea and quickly breached the Hexamilion wall across the Isthmus of Corinth, which was too long to be effectively manned and defended by Thomas' forces. Thomas escaped with his family to Italy, where he had already been recognized as the legitimate heir to the Byzantine Empire at Rome. The commanders of the garrisons of the fortified cities in Morea, deserted by their rulers, chose individually whether to fight or surrender, depending on their own will and circumstances. In the final battle of the Roman Empire in its Byzantine incarnation, Graitzas Palaiologos, the military commander of the city of Salmenikos defeated Mehmed II, who after a month of siege returned home without conquering that 'unimportant city'. In the following year Graitzas received an offer to become a general of the Republic of Venice, which he accepted, thus leaving Salmenikos to the Ottomans.
