As fate would have it the Safavid sect, a sect of shiite priests from Azerbaijan, began gaining popular support in the 1480s. As was his policy, Jahan Shah sought to prevent them from ever becoming a threat by appearing to pander to their beliefs and invited their leader, Sultan Haidar, to his court. Jahan Shah miscalculated badly, as upon Haidar's arrival in Tabriz, the people of the city took up arms against Jahan Shah and proclaimed Haidar ruler of Persia. While it would be a while before Haidar could consolidate his empire, the time of Kara Koyunlu dominance was over.
