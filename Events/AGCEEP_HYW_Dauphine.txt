Charles VI's madness had faciliated a civil war within the ranks of the nobility in France. The Burgundians and the Armagnacs had jockeyed for control of Charles VI and both had periodically exchanged positions of strength. John had murdered Louis Duke of Orleans, in the streets of Paris and years later, had massacred many Armagnacs in Paris when he had entered the city in 1418. Those who survived had fled to the side of the Dauphin, Charles. Hesitating between a final alliance with Henry V and a reconciliation with the Dauphin Charles, the Duke agreed to meet Charles in Montereau. Tempers flared during the meeting, and John and his retainers were cut to pieces. The alternative was to face humiliating concessions...

	#-#Duke Philip of Burgundy's father, John 'the Fearless' had slaughtered the Armagnacs, including their leader, Bernard VI, and in turn had been cut down at Montereau in vengeance. In the aftermath of Montereau, Philip threw his lot in with the English. King Henry V had demanded the Crown of France, and to this effect a treaty recognizing Henry as regent and legitimate successor to Charles VI was drafted and signed at Troyes. Duke John's murder at Montereau had demonstrated to Charles VI that his son was unfit for the throne, a decision that was soon ratified by the Parlement in Paris. Those who refused to swear an oath of allegiance to the new order were now traitors and rebels. The Dauphinists, including the remnants of the Armagnac's, were now rebels in the eyes of the Burgundians and the English usurper, and had retreated south of the Loire shortly before Paris was captured. The Treaty commits England to conquer the lands held by the so-called rebels. Charles VI's remaining forces split along their partisan leanings. Many surrendered, some entered active service for Henry V, while others openly declared themselves for Charles, the 'rebel King of Bourges'. Dauphinist sympathies would stall the English campaign for some time as many strongholds to the south and east of Paris continued to resist the English advance. Nevertheless, the Burgundians commanded the city of Troyes which would facilitate Henry's push to link the Burgundian heartland with his newly acquired French posessions. Despite the early opportunity, the treaty was a serious blow to the sole surviving son of Charles VI and legitimate heir of France. Charles's hesitatation would cost him and his supporters dearly in the early phases of Henry V's renewed conflict...

This peace agreement secured for the King of England a daughter of Charles VI and the Duchies of Normandy and Guyenne in full sovereignty. Charles VI gained Henry V's renunciation of his claim to the Crown of France, and the Duke of Orleans and the Duke of Bourbon now had their freedom. Some within the Armagnac ranks were furious at Charles VI's territorial concessions, as their lands were now feifdoms of the Kingdom of England, and would deeply resent the treaty for years to come. However, the release of the Duke of Orleans and Duke of Bourbon soothed many tempers, and their adjutants were quick to return to the service of their lords. The Dauphin came to realize that England's renunciation of her claim of France was well worth the temporary loss of Guyenne.

This is why his elder sister, Anne of France, stands as regent of France with her husband, Pierre de Beaujeu. If Burgundy had lost the Kingdom of France for lack of a male heir, it was by the regency of a woman that the Valois recovery of the throne would be directed.
