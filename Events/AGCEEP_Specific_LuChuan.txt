	#-#In Xuan De year 3 (AD 1428), Yun Nan's 3 provincial administrators complained that Si Ren Fa, the chief administrator of Lu Chuan, had been invading other tribes. Mu Cheng, the Duke of Qian, requested the sending of 50,000 soldiers to invade Lu Chuan as a punishment, but the Emperor refused, saying that the population was still very unsettled from the campaigns in An Nam and Si Chuan. The Emperor ordered Mu Cheng, along with officials in Yun Nan to diplomatically resolve the issue through decreeing, warning and persuading Si Ren Fa to secure his own borders and pacify his own people. However, by Xuan De year 5 (AD 1430), Si Ren Fa has occupied the area of Meng Yang west of Lu Chuan.

	#-#In Zheng Tong year 1 (AD 1436), the Emperor granted permission to write off Lu Chuan's large amounts of overdue tribute to the Ming Emperor. The Emperor had been persuaded by Lu Chuan's chief administrator, Si Ren Fa, that he was unable to pay because his land had been invaded by Mu Bang and few people were left on his land to be taxed. However, soon after making this excuse, Si Ren Fa launched attacks across large areas in Sout West Yun Nan, and siezed the land of other tribes which were loyal to Ming. By Zheng Tong year 3, month 7 (August, AD 1438), Si Ren Fa declared himself King. Mu Cheng (Duke of Qian) and general Fang Zheng were ordered to crush the rebellion. However, the two generals were at odds about the strategy which led to disaster by the next year. Fang Zheng led an army by himself and pursued deep into enemy territory but was killed in an ambush. Shocked by this news, Mu Cheng died suddenly in the army. His brother Mu Ang replaced him as commander but by Zheng Tong year 6, month 1, day 17 (8th february, AD 1441), Wang Zhen, the powerful eunuch in Ming government, decided to send 150,000 men, led by general Jiang Gui and commanded by military secretary Wang Ji, to eliminate the rebellion.

Rebel forces were defeated and Ming army entered Lu Chuan. However, Si Ren Fa escaped to Myanmar. Ming government decreed that whichever tribe hands over Si Ren Fa to China would be rewarded with the land of Lu Chuan. Myanmar was hesitant about handing over Si Ren Fa, as they did not trust China about rewarding the land to them and feared revenge by Si Ren Fa's son, who fled to Meng Yang. After Ming troops returned home, Si Ren Fa's son, Si Ji Fa, returned to Lu Chuan and continued the rebellion.
