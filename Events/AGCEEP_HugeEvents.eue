	#-#Formalizing the papal support in the Treaty of Tordesillas the world west of the Azores was reserved for Spain and the eastern half for Portugal. Eventually they agreed to push the demarcation line to the west of the Cape Verde islands to ensure Portuguese possession of Brazil. Portugal and Spain may now attack and conquer any non-European provinces without having to declare war on their owner.

	desc = "EVENTHIST115"
	#-#The Gregorian calendar was proposed by Aloysius Lilius, a physician from Naples, and adopted by Pope Gregory XIII in accordance with instructions from the Council of Trent (1545-1563) to correct for errors in the older Julian Calendar. In February, 1582, Pope Gregory XIII issued a Papal Bull requiring that 10 days should be dropped from October 1582 so that 15 October should follow immediately after 4 October, and from then on the reformed calendar should be used. This was observed in Italy, Poland, Portugal, and Spain. Other Catholic countries followed shortly after, the Rest of the World adopted it only after 1700. In most countries it was also decided to adopt 1 January as the start of the year at the same time. In the Gregorian calendar, the tropical year is approximated as 365 97/400 days = 365.2425 days. Thus it takes approximately 3300 years for the tropical year to shift one day with respect to the Gregorian calendar. The approximation 365 97/400 is achieved by having 97 leap years every 400 years. These are calculated introducing a new corrective device to curb further error: century years such as 1700 or 1800 are no longer to be counted as leap years, unless they are like 1600 divisible by 400. If somewhat inelegant, this system was undeniably effective since the Gregorian calendar differed from solar year only by 26 seconds.

Freedom of religion was not completely forthcoming, the Edict of Nantes was repealed in 1685 by the Edict of Fontainebleau, making Protestantism illegal in France, but a trend towards progress had been set in motion. By the end of the Thirty Year's War, the era of the so called Counter-Reformation was at a close. Concurrent with an increase of religious tolerance, the Treaty of Tordesillas was no longer viewed as an impediment to non-Spanish, non-Portuguese colonization. The boundaries of the Holy Roman Empire were also revised accordingly.
