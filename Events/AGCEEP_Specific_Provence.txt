Pope Martinus V, as his predecessors, wanted to see Naples in the firm hands of a trusted man, but as a previous arranged marriage to Jean of Bourbon had failed, and Giovanna was now 50 years old, he decided to invest Louis III of Anjou, Count of Provence, of the junior branch of the House of Anjou, with claims to Naples. Martinus and Louis recruited the help of Neapolitan condottiero Muzio Attendolo, also known as 'lo Sforza'. When Sforza's army invaded Naples, Giovanna turned to Alfons V of Aragon, who had also distant claims to the crown of Naples, and in exchange for his help, adopted him as heir.

Pope Eugenius IV declared that as suzerain he had the right to invest the new King and as for now he would send a bishop as temporary regent. However the Neapolitan people, determined to respect the will of their former Queen, ignored the Papal resolution and sent a delegation to Provence to urge René of Anjou to claim the throne in Naples. Since René of Anjou had been taken captive in Burgundy by Duke Philip the Fair, his wife Isabelle of Lorraine accepted the crown in his place. From his base in Sicily, Alfons of Aragon, who was designated heir by Giovanna between 1420 and 1423, and had a claim to Naples as King of Sicily, gained the support of the Neapolitan nobility hostile to the Anjou dynasty, and started making preparations to invade the Kingdom before the French Angevins could arrive in Naples and take the crown.

	#-#After his release from Milan, Alfons of Aragon returned to Naples, where his brother Pedro had conquered Gaeta. Naples was defended by Isabelle of Lorraine with the support of Pope Eugenius IV. For three years Alfons conducted as much a diplomatic war as a military one, gaining allies to his cause from the Neapolitan nobles. In 1438, René of Anjou paid a huge ransom to Burgundy for his release, and arrived in the Kingdom, but since he had exhausted his funds his allies abandoned him and he had to retreat to Naples. A long siege was then established, during which the Infante Don Pedro was killed by a chance shot to the great grief of his brother. The support of the Genoese fleet allowed René to sustain the besieged capital with success until 1 June 1442, when 300 Aragonese well-armed men entered the town through an open drain accessible during the dry season, revealed to Alfons' son Ferrante by some prisoners. After several hours of fighting and in spite of the stealthy move inside the city walls, Naples withstood the Aragonese and Alfons was forced to retreat to Sicily. After recovering the rest of the Kingdom, René entered the capital in triumph the year after. Pope Eugenius IV, very happy for the Angevin success, invested René as King of Naples and Sicily thus declaring Alfons of Aragon in unlawful possession of the Sicilian island.

Francesco Sforza, ruler of Milan and Venice, the chief state of the league confederates, who was more and more threatened by the advancing Ottomans in her eastern Mediterranean territories, convened a cease-fire while a bilateral treaty was hastily signed in Lodi on 7 April 1454. With that treaty Sforza was legitimated Duke of Milan. Without even being called for, Florence and the Pope had no choice then to endorse the treaty. The King of Naples, being a rightful claimant on the ducal throne reluctantly joined the alliance under the condition to keep Genoa out of it. Intended 'infra terminos italicos', that treaty showed the objective impossibility for all the Italian major powers (specifically Milan, Tuscany, Venice, Naples and Papal States) to prevail upon each other in the struggle for the hegemony in Italy and that the better solution was to come to terms with each other. That would have also avoided the practice of very expensive and pointless wars in the next future. Although the treaty actually played a minor part in Italian balance of powers and so won't be able to avoid future wars of aggression from inside as well from outside Italy, the post-Lodi era historically represented a period of relative peace in which the figurative arts definitively flourished in the whole Italian peninsula, as well as economy and trade and, last but not the least, the skills and tricks of the art of diplomacy.

	#-#Although several peace treaties were stipulated as to guarantee a certain balance of powers in Italy, they couldn't prevent Alfonso I King of Naples from pursuing his old interests on Genoese territories, notably Corsica, and West Mediterranean sea trade routes. Since the confederates of Lega Italica, amongst them Milan, wouldn't risk to break that fragile alliance, and some Genoese families, Adorno and Fieschi amongst them, had clearly in mind to support the Aragonese, King Alfonso represented a real threat for Genoa and the Fregoso family. In 1458, facing a new Aragonese aggression Genoa could only find help in France as it frequently occurred in the past. Charles VII, King of France, accepted the Genoese allegiance and sent Jean d'Anjou, Duke of Calabria and son of René d'Anjou to rule over Genoa. As soon as he established himself in the city as Governor, with the support of the Genoese fleet he arranged a military expedition to be led against Naples with the aim of getting the crown, which his father René failed to succeed in. But this time the political situation in Naples played in his favour: the local barons were opposing Ferdinando, Alfonso's natural son, not recognising him as the new King of Naples. For Jean d'Anjou, it was an invite to become entangled in there...

	#-#In 1458, in accordance with his father's will, Ferdinando succeeded Alfonso I on the throne of Naples. Ferdinando I, also called Don Ferrante, was the natural son of Alfonso V of Aragon and I of Sicily and Naples. In order to arrange a good future to his bastard son, King Alfonso had him married in 1444 to Isabella of Chiaramonte, a feudal heiress of remarkable feudal possessions in Southern Italy and granddaughter of Maria d'Enghien, Queen consort of Ladislao, the last Angevin King of Naples. But after Alfonso died Pope Calixtus III didn't legitimate Ferdinando as new King of Naples, he declared instead that the line of Aragon was extinct and that the Kingdom was to be considered a fief of the church. Although the Pope died before he could make good his claim and the new Pope Pius II on the contrary recognized Ferdinando, Jean d'Anjou, Duke of Lorraine and René's son, also known as 'Duke of Calabria', profiting by the discontent of the pro-Angevin Neapolitan barons, decided to attempt to regain the throne of his ancestors and invaded Naples. The war started well for the Anjou with the easy occupation of Apulia and the temporary control of Naples after the victorious battle of Sarno in 1460. Ferdinand was so severely defeated that his Kingdom seemed to be completely lost in Angevin hands, but with the military help of Francesco Sforza, Duke of Milan, through his brother Alessandro and of the Albanian leader Gjergj Kastrioti, known as 'Skanderbeg', who came to the aid of the prince whose father had aided him, he triumphed over his enemies in the battle of Troja in 1462. By 1464 Ferdinando could re-establish his authority in the Kingdom, Jean d'Anjou left Southern Italy while the barons agreed to recognize the Aragonese as their King.

As a thank you, René accompanied Charles VII on his victorious campaigns of 1449-50 against the English in Normandy. On his wife's death (1453), her duchy of Lorraine passed to René's son John. With Louis XI of France his relations were generally strained, and Louis forced him to yield Anjou to the French crown.
