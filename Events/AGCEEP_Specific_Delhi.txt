Bahlul was an Afghan noble and used the support of the other Afghans to help him ensure a rather smooth transition of power. The downside for Bahlul was that the Afghan theory of Kingship, viewed the King as merely one member of the collective ruling body of the nation. In return for their support, Bahlul was expected to appoint his supporters to important posts, necessarily entailing a curbing of his powers.

The natural reaction of the nobles had been to refuse to assist him in times of war and an ever present danger of open rebellion. Sikandar Lodi, while a religious fanatic, was quite concerned with building up the infrastructure of his empire. Opposing the nobles would have made such reforms impossible.
