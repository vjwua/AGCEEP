	#-#Following the wars against the counts of Holstein the unrest in Sweden was very high due to the war taxes imposed by Erik. In 1434 this resulted in major rebellion in north and central Sweden. Erik had no choice but to sign a treaty that severely reduced his power in Sweden or face a full-scale Swedish war. He ended up signing the treaty and was now obliged to heed the advice to the Swedish State Council as well as only allow Swedish nobles to govern Swedish provinces. Erik was furious and left for his castle in Gotland leaving the administration of Denmark in the hands of the Danish State Council. Even though Erik had left Denmark proper he was still the rightful King of Denmark and recognised as such in all of Europe.
