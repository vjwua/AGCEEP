	#-#In the end of the 15th century the Holy Roman Empire of German Nation was far from being an effective state. While strong national Kingdoms had formed in France, England, Spain and almost all other European nations, it had remained a medieval anachronism, a body composed of independent princes, cities, bishoprics and republics unable to act as one. The need for a reform was obvious, and acknowledged by a strong movement for imperial reform that emerged in the late 1480s. However, such a reform was hindered by conflicting ideas on what state should be the outcome of the reform. One group, consisting of the Emperor and his allies among the imperial cities and the weaker princes of the realm, supported reforms that would enable the Emperor to exploit Germany's considerable resources more effectively than in the past. What they wanted was a stronger authority of the Emperor and an effective national kingdom. This was opposed by those who would lose ground by such a reform, the powerful princes, led by the German Archchancellor, Archbishop-Elector Berthold von Henneberg of Mainz. The faction of the princes wanted a more clearly federal structure that would give their autonomy a legal base and increase their rights to participate in ruling the Empire. The Emperor eventually had to seek a compromise that was strongly in favour of the princes in order to get the urgently needed reforms done. Thus several reforms, including the Perpetual Peace which outlawed feuding in the whole Empire forever, the establishment of the Imperial Chamber Court, a tribunal financed and factually controlled by the princes that was to arbitrate conflict between members of the Empire, the creation of Imperial Circles, regional districts that had the tasks to enforce Imperial Chamber Court decisions, to control minting and to assemble and maintain contingents for the Imperial Army , and the introduction of the Common Penny, a direct, universal property and poll tax that was supposed to finance the defence of the Emperor and the Chamber Court, were passed by an Imperial Diet at Worms in 1495. Our excellent diplomatic position within the Empire, especially the certain support of a great majority within the council of electors, would allow us to push more extensive reforms that could ensure a more effective administration and could turn Germany into a powerful national kingdom. This would surely meet resistance within the Empire and among the neighbouring countries that would feel threatened by such a state.

	#-#In the end of the 15th century the Holy Roman Empire of German Nation was far from being an effective state. While strong national Kingdoms had formed in France, England, Spain and almost all other European nations, it had remained a medieval anachronism, a body composed of independent princes, cities, bishoprics and republics unable to act as one. The need for a reform was obvious, and acknowledged by a strong movement for imperial reform that emerged in the late 1480s. However, such a reform was hindered by conflicting ideas on what state should be the outcome of the reform. One group, consisting of the Emperor and his allies among the imperial cities and the weaker princes of the realm, supported reforms that would enable the Emperor to exploit Germany's considerable resources more effectively than in the past. What they wanted was a stronger authority of the Emperor and an effective national kingdom. This was opposed by those who would lose ground by such a reform, the powerful princes, led by the German Archchancellor, Archbishop-Elector Berthold von Henneberg of Mainz. The faction of the princes wanted a more clearly federal structure that would give their autonomy a legal base and increase their rights to participate in ruling the Empire. The Emperor eventually had to seek a compromise that was strongly in favour of the princes in order to get the urgently needed reforms done. Thus several reforms, including the Perpetual Peace which outlawed feuding in the whole Empire forever, the establishment of the Imperial Chamber Court, a tribunal financed and factually controlled by the princes that was to arbitrate conflict between members of the Empire, the creation of Imperial Circles, regional districts that had the tasks to enforce Imperial Chamber Court decisions, to control minting and to assemble and maintain contingents for the Imperial Army , and the introduction of the Common Penny, a direct, universal property and poll tax that was supposed to finance the defence of the Emperor and the Chamber Court, were passed by an Imperial Diet at Worms in 1495. Our excellent diplomatic position within the Empire, especially the certain support of a great majority within the council of electors, would allow us to push more extensive reforms that could ensure a more effective administration and could turn Germany into a powerful national kingdom. This would surely meet resistance within the Empire and among the neighbouring countries that would feel threatened by such a state.

While strong national Kingdoms had formed in France, England, Spain and almost all other European nations, it had remained a medieval anachronism, a body composed of independent princes, cities, bishoprics and republics unable to act as one. The need for a reform was obvious, and acknowledged by a strong movement for imperial reform that emerged in the late 1480s. However, such a reform was hindered by conflicting ideas on what state should be the outcome of the reform. One group, consisting of the Emperor and his allies among the imperial cities and the weaker princes of the realm, supported reforms that would enable the Emperor to exploit Germany's considerable resources more effectively than in the past. What they wanted was a stronger authority of the Emperor and an effective national kingdom. This was opposed by those who would lose ground by such a reform, the powerful princes, led by the German Archchancellor, Archbishop-Elector Berthold von Henneberg of Mainz. The faction of the princes wanted a more clearly federal structure that would give their autonomy a legal base and increase their rights to participate in ruling the Empire. The Emperor eventually had to seek a compromise that was strongly in favour of the princes in order to get the urgently needed reforms done. Thus several reforms, including the Perpetual Peace which outlawed feuding in the whole Empire forever, the establishment of the Imperial Chamber Court, a tribunal financed and factually controlled by the princes that was to arbitrate conflict between members of the Empire, the creation of Imperial Circles, regional districts that had the tasks to enforce Imperial Chamber Court decisions, to control minting and to assemble and maintain contingents for the Imperial Army , and the introduction of the Common Penny, a direct, universal property and poll tax that was supposed to finance the defence of the Emperor and the Chamber Court, were passed by an Imperial Diet at Worms in 1495. Our excellent diplomatic position within the Empire, especially the certain support of a great majority within the council of electors, would allow us to push more extensive reforms that could ensure a more effective administration and could turn Germany into a powerful national kingdom. This would surely meet resistance within the Empire and among the neighbouring countries that would feel threatened by such a state.

One group, consisting of the Emperor and his allies among the imperial cities and the weaker princes of the realm, supported reforms that would enable the Emperor to exploit Germany's considerable resources more effectively than in the past. In order to accomplish that, they demanded major innovations such as a regular system of imperial taxation and a regular administration of Germany in absentia by an imperial governing council that was to be kept under the Emperor's control. The emperor has made more extensive reforms that could ensure a more effective administration and could turn Germany into a powerful national Kingdom.

While strong national Kingdoms had formed in France, England, Spain and almost all other European nations, it had remained a medieval anachronism, a body composed of independent princes, cities, bishoprics and republics unable to act as one. The need for a reform was obvious, and acknowledged by a strong movement for imperial reform that emerged in the late 1480s. However, such a reform was hindered by conflicting ideas on what state should be the outcome of the reform. One group, consisting of the Emperor and his allies among the imperial cities and the weaker princes of the realm, supported reforms that would enable the Emperor to exploit Germany's considerable resources more effectively than in the past. What they wanted was a stronger authority of the Emperor and an effective national kingdom. This was opposed by those who would lose ground by such a reform, the powerful princes, led by the German Archchancellor, Archbishop-Elector Berthold von Henneberg of Mainz. The faction of the princes wanted a more clearly federal structure that would give their autonomy a legal base and increase their rights to participate in ruling the Empire. The Emperor eventually had to seek a compromise that was strongly in favour of the princes in order to get the urgently needed reforms done. Thus several reforms, including the Perpetual Peace which outlawed feuding in the whole Empire forever, the establishment of the Imperial Chamber Court, a tribunal financed and factually controlled by the princes that was to arbitrate conflict between members of the Empire, the creation of Imperial Circles, regional districts that had the tasks to enforce Imperial Chamber Court decisions, to control minting and to assemble and maintain contingents for the Imperial Army , and the introduction of the Common Penny, a direct, universal property and poll tax that was supposed to finance the defence of the Emperor and the Chamber Court, were passed by an Imperial Diet at Worms in 1495. Our excellent diplomatic position within the Empire, especially the certain support of a great majority within the council of electors, would allow us to push more extensive reforms that could ensure a more effective administration and could turn Germany into a powerful national kingdom. This would surely meet resistance within the Empire and among the neighbouring countries that would feel threatened by such a state.

However, such a reform was hindered by conflicting ideas on what state should be the outcome of the reform. One group, consisting of the Emperor and his allies among the imperial cities and the weaker princes of the realm, supported reforms that would enable the Emperor to exploit Germany's considerable resources more effectively than in the past. What they wanted was a stronger authority of the Emperor and an effective national kingdom. This was opposed by those who would lose ground by such a reform, the powerful princes, led by the German Archchancellor, Archbishop-Elector Berthold von Henneberg of Mainz. The faction of the princes wanted a more clearly federal structure that would give their autonomy a legal base and increase their rights to participate in ruling the Empire. The Emperor eventually had to seek a compromise that was strongly in favour of the princes in order to get the urgently needed reforms done. Thus several reforms, including the Perpetual Peace which outlawed feuding in the whole Empire forever, the establishment of the Imperial Chamber Court, a tribunal financed and factually controlled by the princes that was to arbitrate conflict between members of the Empire, the creation of Imperial Circles, regional districts that had the tasks to enforce Imperial Chamber Court decisions, to control minting and to assemble and maintain contingents for the Imperial Army , and the introduction of the Common Penny, a direct, universal property and poll tax that was supposed to finance the defence of the Emperor and the Chamber Court, were passed by an Imperial Diet at Worms in 1495. Our excellent diplomatic position within the Empire, especially the certain support of a great majority within the council of electors, would allow us to push more extensive reforms that could ensure a more effective administration and could turn Germany into a powerful national kingdom. This would surely meet resistance within the Empire and among the neighbouring countries that would feel threatened by such a state.

The need for a reform was obvious, and acknowledged by a strong movement for imperial reform that emerged in the late 1480s. However, such a reform was hindered by conflicting ideas on what state should be the outcome of the reform. One group, consisting of the Emperor and his allies among the imperial cities and the weaker princes of the realm, supported reforms that would enable the Emperor to exploit Germany's considerable resources more effectively than in the past. In order to accomplish that, they demanded major innovations such as a regular system of imperial taxation and a regular administration of Germany in absentia by an imperial governing council that was to be kept under the Emperor's control. The emperor has made more extensive reforms that could ensure a more effective administration and could turn Germany into a powerful national Kingdom. This forceful revival of the medieval Kingdom of Germany has alarmed courts throughout Europe, and hostile reaction is forming against this usurper state. There is a strong call for severing ties and declaring war on the emperor.

	#-#In the end of the 15th century the Holy Roman Empire of German Nation was far from being an effective state. While strong national Kingdoms had formed in France, England, Spain and almost all other European nations, it had remained a medieval anachronism, a body composed of independent princes, cities, bishoprics and republics unable to act as one. The need for a reform was obvious, and acknowledged by a strong movement for imperial reform that emerged in the late 1480s. However, such a reform was hindered by conflicting ideas on what state should be the outcome of the reform. One group, consisting of the Emperor and his allies among the imperial cities and the weaker princes of the realm, supported reforms that would enable the Emperor to exploit Germany's considerable resources more effectively than in the past. What they wanted was a stronger authority of the Emperor and an effective national kingdom. This was opposed by those who would lose ground by such a reform, the powerful princes, led by the German Archchancellor, Archbishop-Elector Berthold von Henneberg of Mainz. The faction of the princes wanted a more clearly federal structure that would give their autonomy a legal base and increase their rights to participate in ruling the Empire. The Emperor eventually had to seek a compromise that was strongly in favour of the princes in order to get the urgently needed reforms done. Thus several reforms, including the Perpetual Peace which outlawed feuding in the whole Empire forever, the establishment of the Imperial Chamber Court, a tribunal financed and factually controlled by the princes that was to arbitrate conflict between members of the Empire, the creation of Imperial Circles, regional districts that had the tasks to enforce Imperial Chamber Court decisions, to control minting and to assemble and maintain contingents for the Imperial Army , and the introduction of the Common Penny, a direct, universal property and poll tax that was supposed to finance the defence of the Emperor and the Chamber Court, were passed by an Imperial Diet at Worms in 1495. Our excellent diplomatic position within the Empire, especially the certain support of a great majority within the council of electors, would allow us to push more extensive reforms that could ensure a more effective administration and could turn Germany into a powerful national kingdom. This would surely meet resistance within the Empire and among the neighbouring countries that would feel threatened by such a state.

While strong national Kingdoms had formed in France, England, Spain and almost all other European nations, it had remained a medieval anachronism, a body composed of independent princes, cities, bishoprics and republics unable to act as one. The need for a reform was obvious, and acknowledged by a strong movement for imperial reform that emerged in the late 1480s. However, such a reform was hindered by conflicting ideas on what state should be the outcome of the reform. One group, consisting of the Emperor and his allies among the imperial cities and the weaker princes of the realm, supported reforms that would enable the Emperor to exploit Germany's considerable resources more effectively than in the past. What they wanted was a stronger authority of the Emperor and an effective national kingdom. This was opposed by those who would lose ground by such a reform, the powerful princes, led by the German Archchancellor, Archbishop-Elector Berthold von Henneberg of Mainz. The faction of the princes wanted a more clearly federal structure that would give their autonomy a legal base and increase their rights to participate in ruling the Empire. The Emperor eventually had to seek a compromise that was strongly in favour of the princes in order to get the urgently needed reforms done. Thus several reforms, including the Perpetual Peace which outlawed feuding in the whole Empire forever, the establishment of the Imperial Chamber Court, a tribunal financed and factually controlled by the princes that was to arbitrate conflict between members of the Empire, the creation of Imperial Circles, regional districts that had the tasks to enforce Imperial Chamber Court decisions, to control minting and to assemble and maintain contingents for the Imperial Army , and the introduction of the Common Penny, a direct, universal property and poll tax that was supposed to finance the defence of the Emperor and the Chamber Court, were passed by an Imperial Diet at Worms in 1495. Our excellent diplomatic position within the Empire, especially the certain support of a great majority within the council of electors, would allow us to push more extensive reforms that could ensure a more effective administration and could turn Germany into a powerful national kingdom. This would surely meet resistance within the Empire and among the neighbouring countries that would feel threatened by such a state.

This was opposed by those who would lose ground by such a reform, the powerful princes, led by the German Archchancellor, Archbishop-Elector Berthold von Henneberg of Mainz. The faction of the princes wanted a more clearly federal structure that would give their autonomy a legal base and increase their rights to participate in ruling the Empire. The Emperor eventually had to seek a compromise that was strongly in favour of the princes in order to get the urgently needed reforms done. Thus several reforms, including the Perpetual Peace which outlawed feuding in the whole Empire forever, the establishment of the Imperial Chamber Court, a tribunal financed and factually controlled by the princes that was to arbitrate conflict between members of the Empire, the creation of Imperial Circles, regional districts that had the tasks to enforce Imperial Chamber Court decisions, to control minting and to assemble and maintain contingents for the Imperial Army , and the introduction of the Common Penny, a direct, universal property and poll tax that was supposed to finance the defence of the Emperor and the Chamber Court, were passed by an Imperial Diet at Worms in 1495. Our excellent diplomatic position within the Empire, especially the certain support of a great majority within the council of electors, would allow us to push more extensive reforms that could ensure a more effective administration and could turn Germany into a powerful national kingdom. This would surely meet resistance within the Empire and among the neighbouring countries that would feel threatened by such a state.

The need for a reform was obvious, and acknowledged by a strong movement for imperial reform that emerged in the late 1480s. However, such a reform was hindered by conflicting ideas on what state should be the outcome of the reform.

The emperor has made more extensive reforms that could ensure a more effective administration and could turn Germany into a powerful national Kingdom.

	#-#In the end of the 15th century the Holy Roman Empire of German Nation was far from being an effective state. While strong national Kingdoms had formed in France, England, Spain and almost all other European nations, it had remained a medieval anachronism, a body composed of independent princes, cities, bishoprics and republics unable to act as one. The need for a reform was obvious, and acknowledged by a strong movement for imperial reform that emerged in the late 1480s. However, such a reform was hindered by conflicting ideas on what state should be the outcome of the reform. One group, consisting of the Emperor and his allies among the imperial cities and the weaker princes of the realm, supported reforms that would enable the Emperor to exploit Germany's considerable resources more effectively than in the past. What they wanted was a stronger authority of the Emperor and an effective national kingdom. This was opposed by those who would lose ground by such a reform, the powerful princes, led by the German Archchancellor, Archbishop-Elector Berthold von Henneberg of Mainz. The faction of the princes wanted a more clearly federal structure that would give their autonomy a legal base and increase their rights to participate in ruling the Empire. The Emperor eventually had to seek a compromise that was strongly in favour of the princes in order to get the urgently needed reforms done. Thus several reforms, including the Perpetual Peace which outlawed feuding in the whole Empire forever, the establishment of the Imperial Chamber Court, a tribunal financed and factually controlled by the princes that was to arbitrate conflict between members of the Empire, the creation of Imperial Circles, regional districts that had the tasks to enforce Imperial Chamber Court decisions, to control minting and to assemble and maintain contingents for the Imperial Army , and the introduction of the Common Penny, a direct, universal property and poll tax that was supposed to finance the defence of the Emperor and the Chamber Court, were passed by an Imperial Diet at Worms in 1495. Our excellent diplomatic position within the Empire, especially the certain support of a great majority within the council of electors, would allow us to push more extensive reforms that could ensure a more effective administration and could turn Germany into a powerful national kingdom. This would surely meet resistance within the Empire and among the neighbouring countries that would feel threatened by such a state.

	#-#In the end of the 15th century the Holy Roman Empire of German Nation was far from being an effective state. While strong national Kingdoms had formed in France, England, Spain and almost all other European nations, it had remained a medieval anachronism, a body composed of independent princes, cities, bishoprics and republics unable to act as one. The need for a reform was obvious, and acknowledged by a strong movement for imperial reform that emerged in the late 1480s. However, such a reform was hindered by conflicting ideas on what state should be the outcome of the reform. One group, consisting of the Emperor and his allies among the imperial cities and the weaker princes of the realm, supported reforms that would enable the Emperor to exploit Germany's considerable resources more effectively than in the past. What they wanted was a stronger authority of the Emperor and an effective national kingdom. This was opposed by those who would lose ground by such a reform, the powerful princes, led by the German Archchancellor, Archbishop-Elector Berthold von Henneberg of Mainz. The faction of the princes wanted a more clearly federal structure that would give their autonomy a legal base and increase their rights to participate in ruling the Empire. The Emperor eventually had to seek a compromise that was strongly in favour of the princes in order to get the urgently needed reforms done. Thus several reforms, including the Perpetual Peace which outlawed feuding in the whole Empire forever, the establishment of the Imperial Chamber Court, a tribunal financed and factually controlled by the princes that was to arbitrate conflict between members of the Empire, the creation of Imperial Circles, regional districts that had the tasks to enforce Imperial Chamber Court decisions, to control minting and to assemble and maintain contingents for the Imperial Army , and the introduction of the Common Penny, a direct, universal property and poll tax that was supposed to finance the defence of the Emperor and the Chamber Court, were passed by an Imperial Diet at Worms in 1495. Our excellent diplomatic position within the Empire, especially the certain support of a great majority within the council of electors, would allow us to push more extensive reforms that could ensure a more effective administration and could turn Germany into a powerful national kingdom. This would surely meet resistance within the Empire and among the neighbouring countries that would feel threatened by such a state.

Only the territories of the Electors and the Habsburg Archdukes are still excluded from these reforms due to the regal powers they have been granted by the Golden Bull and the Privilegum Maius.

His career primed in 1809 when he was assigned the post as minister of Imperial foreign affairs. Until 1813 Metternich will pursue a policy of acquiescence to French supremacy. A policy which ends with the creation of the Quadruple Alliance, the war against France, and the allied victory the very same year. The following 35 years have been called the Age of Metternich for during this time he was the chief arbiter of Europe. The Metternich system depended upon political and religious censorship, espionage, and the suppression of revolutionary and nationalist movements. This system holds part of the blame for the revolutions of 1848.

The Empire thus became a militaristic and absolutist state.

The New Ideals was religious freedom, education and freedom of speech and political opinion. The monumental work that captured the essence of the enlightenment was Diderot's Encyclopédie, taking 25 years for it's completion and in the end totaling a collection of no less then 35 volumes of 1000 pages each describing everything from how to knit a sock to methods of improving the manufacturing of artillery pieces. Of the monarchs of Europe none was a stronger believer of these ideas than the Holy Roman Emperor, Friedrich VIII also know as Frederick the Great.
