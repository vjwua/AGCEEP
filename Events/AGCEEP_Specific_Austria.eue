After that, he was of immense help to Albrecht in ending the anarchy and lawlessness in Austria – which hadn't had much of a central authority between 1404 (the premature death of Albrecht IV) and 1411 (when Albrecht and the Austrian estates took over) and was therefore plagued by feuds and robbery - during the first years of his reign.

Despite a guarantee of safe-conduct by Emperor Sigismund, he was executed at the stake for heresy at the Council of Constance in 1415. This could however not stop the Hussite movement in Bohemia. Hus' followers were rapidly growing, and when King Vaclav IV of Bohemia died and his brother Sigismund, already Emperor and King of Hungary was to succeed him, they, unwilling to forgive him the betrayal of Hus and afraid that he would suppress them, refused to acknowledge him and gained control of most of Bohemia proper - while the lands of the Bohemian crown and the catholic part of Bohemia accepted Sigismund. Due to its radical anti-clerical and anti-feudal tendencies Hussitism posed a big threat to the church and nobility in the countries adjacent to Bohemia. Several German and European princes therefore decided to oppose the Hussites and to support Sigismund in his struggle with them that lasted for almost two decades. Should we decide to fight these heretics, we should be aware that this would be internationally regarded as an intervention in favour of Sigismund as rightful King of Bohemia rather than a war of conquest, and that therefore, if Sigismund prevails and manages to restore royal authority, we would be expected to turn over any conquests in Bohemia to the Kingdom of Bohemia.

On May 23rd 1420, all Jews living in the Ducal cities of Austria were captured and their estate confiscated. The children were forcefully baptized. Among the adult Jews, the poor were banished from the country, while the rich were kept hostage and tortured in order find out were they hid the massive treasures that they were accused of having. In order to avoid torture, loss of their property, forced conversion and the continuous humiliation, most of the Jews from Vienna committed suicide in their synagogue. Only about 300 Jews remained in Vienna, and even these were not tolerated. Using the standard fake reproach against Jews, the desecration of housels, Albrecht condemned 210 Jews to be burned at the stake on March 21st 1421. Within only a year, a large, prosperous Jewish community that had been the backbone of Austria's economy and a major creditor of the Habsburgs throughout the 14th century had been almost completely exterminated.

Although Bohemia and Hungary were only held for a short time, this was the beginning of the Habsburg dynasty's rapid rise that was to reach its peak when four generations later Charles V was master of an Empire where the sun never set.

Still feeling menaced by the Ottomans, a majority of the Diet consisting mostly of the middle and lower nobility however did not want to trust the country's fortune upon a woman and an unborn child and, led by the Transylvanian noble Janos Hunyadi, desired an adult King with a decent powerbase instead. It was Hunyadi who proposed the most obvious choice, Wladyslaw III, King of the other big Christian Kingdom in East Europe, Poland. Initially with the consent of Elizabeth, deputies of the Diet approached the nineteen-year-old Wladyslaw in Krakow and offered him the Hungarian crown. Meanwhile, Elizabeth gave birth to a son, the male heir Albrecht and she had hoped for, and called him Ladislaus. Since then, she was determined to secure the throne for her child and thus withdrew her approval of the offer to the Polish King. But instructed by Hunyadi and other magnates, negotiations continued. When Wladyslaw eventually accepted the proferred throne on March 8th 1440 and everything seemed ready for his coronation and the union of the two Kingdoms, Elizabeth fled Hungary to Austria with her son and the stolen Holy crown of Hungary. She had Ladislaus crowned King in Székesfehérvár on May 1st, more than two months before Wladyslaw's coronation on July 17th. The scene was set for a civil war between the supporters of Elizabeth and Ladislaus, called 'Loyalists' who were strongest in Western Hungary and Slovakia and championed by Ulrich of Cilli on the one side and the supporters of Wladyslaw, the 'Nationalists', based largely in the East and Transylvania and led by Janos Hunyadi, on the other.

Thus the peace concluded between Poland, Bohemia and Hungary in 1477 did not include Friedrich. The rivalry between the two, before sparked by Friedrich suspecting Matthias of secretly allowing the Ottomans to invade Austria through Hungary and supporting Wladislas Jagiello as King of Bohemia against the claims of Matthias, deteriorated into a personal feud. On the battlefield, Matthias Corvinus got the upper hand, swiftly defeated Friedrich even after he had gathered an Imperial army and invaded his hereditary lands. Within 5 years Matthias army reduced Frederick's strongholds one by one. The Emperor was deeply humiliated and his defeat evident in 1485 when Hungarian armies captured Vienna and he had to flee to Linz. In the last years of his life he was deeply depressive due to this shame. Vienna was only recaptured by his son Maximilian.

Satisfied that the country was sufficiently weakened and disorganized, Louis XI ordered his army into Artois and Hainault, but the imminence of danger seemed to revive in the Burgundian provinces a spirit of loyalty towards the Valois heiress and arrangements were made for the marriage of Mary with Maximilian of Habsburg, Archduke of Austria and son of the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick III.

	#-#The presence of Charles VIII of France in the Kingdom of Naples scared the Italian princes, who had in a certain way permitted the French King to achieve his goal of settling there almost undisturbed. Venice and Florence were worried about a French hegemony in the peninsula. French military presence wasn't limited to Southern Italy but also to villages of Tuscany and the Papal States, which previously surrendered to Charles VIII in his march towards Naples, strategically located to grant the French military supply line. The Pope, who previously granted the French King military access through the Papal territories and consented his stay in Rome, felt in jeopardy as much as to refuse Charles VIII being proclaimed King of Naples. Also King Ferdinand of Aragon couldn't accept the French presence in a Kingdom where he instead, in spite of Alfons V's testament which assigned Naples to the other Trastamara branch, could be the one to have claims there. The position of Naples was also important for the Aragonese trading in the Mediterranean. The Duke of Milan, who decisively affected Charles VIII's decision to settle in Naples, was now alarmed by the presence of French reserve troops deployed in the county of Asti, very close to Milan and at the order of the Duke of Orléans, who had dynastical claims to the Milanese throne. So Venice, Milan, the Pope, Spain and even the Holy Roman Empire (so firmly opposed to the French expansionism in Italy as to join any Anti-French alliance available) consequently formed the Anti-French league in Venice on 31 March 1495. Florence preferred to stay out because of her internal problems caused by Charles VIII's passage and decided to support France instead. Having heard about those arrangements and fearing that the confederates would isolate his army in Italy, Charles VIII decided to return to France for reinforcements leaving his regent in Naples. He had to move his army quickly through the Apennines as to reach the Alps and then safety, but the presence of heavy artilleries and carriages transporting the big loot he accumulated across Italy, slowed his march down. Only at Fornovo on the Taro River, in the Po Valley, Charles VIII finally faced the army of the confederates. Despite having lost all the carriages, he managed to reach the Alps gaining from his expedition to Italy nothing but his army decimated by epidemies.

	#-#Since 1495, Venice had been holding the main ports of Apulia despite Aragonese claims to have them back. With the French invasion of Milan, Venice had acquired Milanese territories east of the Adda River, and upon the fall of Cesare Borgia had also acquired Rimini, Faenza and Ravenna, against the will of Pope Julius II. The Venetians also held Veneto and Friuli, on which Maximilian of Habsburg had imperial claims. In late 1507 Maximilian announced his intention to travel to Italy to receive the imperial investiture from the Pope himself, and in early 1508 he assembled a big army to escort him down to Rome. He requested free passage through Venetian territories, but was told that he would be allowed passage only without his army. Enraged at the answer, Maximilian attacked Venice, but this decision proved unwise: Venice not only routed the imperial army but also seized the imperial cities of Trieste, Gorz and Fiume. A second assault by a Tyrolean force several weeks later was an even greater failure, forcing Maximilian to conclude a humiliating three-year truce. With Pope Julius II's assent, Maximilian took the title of 'Emperor-elect', thus breaking the century-old custom that the Holy Roman Emperor had to be crowned by the Pope. Shortly afterward, Venice provided a pretext for war by appointing her own candidate to the vacant bishopric of Vicenza. The Emperor, the King of France and Ferdinand of Aragon gathered in Cambrai in December 1508 to sign a treaty which seemed to be a defensive alliance against the Turk. In reality they meant to form a league to attack Venice and deprive the Serenissima of most of her mainland territories. Pope Julius II, after a renewed Venetian refusal to give the Romagna lands back to the Papacy, ratified the treaty and at the same time proceeded to excommunicate all Venetian citizens. Ferrara and Mantua, each with separate claims to territories held by Venice, joined the league as well. In April 1509 military operations started, and a month later French troops decimated one of the two Venetian armies at the battle of Agnadello. Even though in August 1509 Venice managed to eliminate Mantua from the war, she still faced the collapse of her strategic position and had by February 24, 1510 to accept the papal demands on the cities she had occupied in Romagna. However, Pope Julius II was still not satisfied and demanded that the war be prosecuted until Venice conceded control over their church to the Pope and compensated him for his expenses. The Council of Ten had privately resolved that the terms had been accepted under duress and were therefore invalid, and that Venice should violate them at the earliest opportunity. This opportunity presented itself shortly afterward.

	#-#Since 1495, Venice had been holding the main ports of Apulia despite Aragonese claims to have them back. With the French invasion of Milan, Venice had acquired Milanese territories east of the Adda River, and upon the fall of Cesare Borgia had also acquired Rimini, Faenza and Ravenna, against the will of Pope Julius II. The Venetians also held Veneto and Friuli, on which Maximilian of Habsburg had imperial claims. In late 1507 Maximilian announced his intention to travel to Italy to receive the imperial investiture from the Pope himself, and in early 1508 he assembled a big army to escort him down to Rome. He requested free passage through Venetian territories, but was told that he would be allowed passage only without his army. Enraged at the answer, Maximilian attacked Venice, but this decision proved unwise: Venice not only routed the imperial army but also seized the imperial cities of Trieste, Gorz and Fiume. A second assault by a Tyrolean force several weeks later was an even greater failure, forcing Maximilian to conclude a humiliating three-year truce. With Pope Julius II's assent, Maximilian took the title of 'Emperor-elect', thus breaking the century-old custom that the Holy Roman Emperor had to be crowned by the Pope. Shortly afterward, Venice provided a pretext for war by appointing her own candidate to the vacant bishopric of Vicenza. The Emperor, the King of France and Ferdinand of Aragon gathered in Cambrai in December 1508 to sign a treaty which seemed to be a defensive alliance against the Turk. In reality they meant to form a league to attack Venice and deprive the Serenissima of most of her mainland territories. Pope Julius II, after a renewed Venetian refusal to give the Romagna lands back to the Papacy, ratified the treaty and at the same time proceeded to excommunicate all Venetian citizens. Ferrara and Mantua, each with separate claims to territories held by Venice, joined the league as well. In April 1509 military operations started, and a month later French troops decimated one of the two Venetian armies at the battle of Agnadello. Even though in August 1509 Venice managed to eliminate Mantua from the war, she still faced the collapse of her strategic position and had by February 24, 1510 to accept the papal demands on the cities she had occupied in Romagna. However, Pope Julius II was still not satisfied and demanded that the war be prosecuted until Venice conceded control over their church to the Pope and compensated him for his expenses. The Council of Ten had privately resolved that the terms had been accepted under duress and were therefore invalid, and that Venice should violate them at the earliest opportunity. This opportunity presented itself shortly afterward.

	#-#In 1510 Venice submitted to the Pope, thus lessening the league of Cambrai. Conditions were hard for Venice, the Republic had to renounce her traditional power to appoint bishops as well as all jurisdiction over Papal subjects in Venetian territory and was to compensate Pope Julius II for his war expenses needed to recapture the Papal holdings in Romagna, while the Pope accepted the humble request of the Republic for pardon, cancelling the interdict. But the reconciliation between Venice and the Pope did not stop the French to continue the war against Venice with attacks to her cities in Terraferma. Julius II, in the meanwhile, had become increasingly concerned by the growing French presence in Italy and formulated plans, both to chase the French out of the Po Valley and to seize the Duchy of Ferrara, a French ally, with the intention to add the territories of Modena, Reggio and Ferrara to the Papal States. In realizing his plan the Pope immediately excommunicated Alfonso d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, declaring his fief forfeited for his remaining loyal to France, then he gained the military support of Venice, eager to recover her territories lost to the French a armies and hired an army of Swiss mercenaries to attack Milan as to isolate the French armies in Italy. However his plans failed as the French army managed to invade Romagna and occupy the cities of Bologna and Ravenna, supported by the powerful and celebrated artillery of Duke Alfonso d'Este. In addition, in response to Pope's switching sides, Louis XII of France convoked a Schismatic Council at Pisa as to have the 'Warrior Pope' deposed. Pope Julius II, having unsuccessfully pressed the Republic of Florence to refuse hosting the schismatic cardinals, proclaimed the Holy League against France and convoked a Council of his own to meet at the Lateran in Rome. The promise of territorial gains at French expense caused Ferdinand II of Aragon and Emperor Maximilian I to abandon their alliance with the French, and in October 1511, they joined the newly-formed Holy League together with Julius II and the Republic of Venice. In November, Henry VIII of England and the Swiss confederation joined as well.

According to the most popular one, an angel appeared to Maximilian in Cologne telling him to ride to Trier. When he entered the cathedral of Trier, suddenly 15 candles on the altar began to burn. The altar was moved, and beyond there was a mantle made of one piece of cloth that the present clerics identified as the mantle of Christ, and some dice recognized as the dice of the guards who crucified him. This seamless mantle became the symbol for the Holy Roman Empire and the undivided Christian world.

But his son Philip died unexpectedly early in 1506, leaving two male heirs, Charles and Ferdinand which were respectively born in 1500 and 1503. Maximilian decided to support Charles, who in 1516 was already Archduke of Burgundy, King of Spain, Sicily and Naples, in his investiture as King of the Romans and future Holy Roman Emperor. But this diplomatic move would have been very expensive. Most of the German princes were already supporting the French candidate, King François Ier. Maximilian seemed to successfully convoy the favour of the imperial electors towards the Habsburg cause, by means of granting investitures and making promises of large sums of money with the help of bankers such as the Fuggers and the Welsers. The Pope, who couldn't accept the presence of an Emperor with territorial claims in Italy as it was under the rule of Emperor Frederick II, would have supported a German prince like Friedrich III of Saxony, with no particular interest laying beyond the Alps. Looking for international credit, also Henry VIII King of England took part in the imperial election offering his candidature but withdrew soon after the first consultations.

Having proclaimed himself as the only legitimate heir of Charlemagne, the first Holy Roman Emperor, François Ier had announced his candidature to the imperial election. Commonly all the electors were bribed in order to obtain their much desired vote, but Charles 'bought' the Imperial title by paying the Great Electors and their emissaries the huge sum of 850,000 golden florins (equal to a value of 2,100 kilograms of gold). That money was advanced by his bankers in anticipation of several years worth of Castilian rents. Charles's election was also eased by the Army of the Svevian league, which impressed the doubtful electors when chasing the Duke of Württemberg, chief of the pro-French party, out of his duchy. That denied François his last remote chance to win the election. Being elected Holy Roman Emperor as Charles V, Charles (Karl in the German world or Carlos in Spain) of the House of Habsburg became suzerain of all the fiefs in the Holy Roman Empire. Amongst them the Duchy of Milan together with its sovereignty over the Republic of Genoa formed the beginning of the so-called 'Spanish Road' a critical route that allowed communication by land between the Habsburgs's dominions.

	#-#The 14,000 lansquenets, hired by Charles V in the war against the League of Cognac under the command of Georg von Frundsberg, were animated by a violent spirit of crusade against the Pope (Frundsberg was bringing a golden rope with which he insanely meant to hang the Pope and his cardinals!) but also, and most of all, angry for lack of pay. Abandoned by their captains, they begun to plunder villages in search of loots. Soon they were joined by 6,000 Spanish soldiers lead by Charles, Connétable de Bourbon, and by any sort of ruffians of any condition (mercenaries at the Emperor's service, deserting or disbanded troops of the League and common criminals), all of them with the common aim to make the way to Rome, the city of sin, and 'sack' it. On the morning of 6 May 1527, from his headquarters set up on the Gianicolo hill, Captain General Bourbon with his 40,000 soldiers launched a series of attacks on Rome. During one of them, at the Torrione Gate, while leading the assault of the walls, he himself was mortally wounded (Benvenuto Cellini, who took part in the defence of the walls, would boast about having shot the deadly bullet). Instead of being let down, the Spanish troops' confidence was boosted by their commander's sudden death and at the expenses of big losses, managed to break through the city walls and enter the Borgo while the imperial lansquenets broke rushed towards the Holy See. Pope Clement VII and his followers were able to escape into safety, thanks to the 'Passetto', a secret corridor which Pope Alexander VI had built along the top of the wall connecting the Vatican with Castel Sant'Angelo. Across the Sisto bridge the bewildered soldiers fell on the unarmed city and for eight days committed every sort of violence, theft, sacrilege and massacre. The streets were a mixture of drunken soldiers, corpses and heaps of every sort of luxury goods taken from churches, monasteries and palaces. No league army dared to enter the city to drive out the ravaging troops and rescue the Pope, who accepted to pay a huge ransom only six months later. Although the exact role of the emperor in this act is unclear, it hurt his standing internationally, and caused something of a domestic crisis. It was one of the motivations for the alliance between England and France in 1527, and for the war with those countries that followed.

Princes and ambassadors of all Italian states came to this encounter with the intention to confirm their allegiance to the Empire. Charles V used his strengthened political influence to definitely settle the Italian balance of powers and the conflicts between the Italian minors that deceitfully used to switch sides between France and the Empire. According to Mercurino da Gattinara's advices Charles V granted independence to all the imperial fiefs and, with the mediation of Pope Clemens VII, even to Francesco Sforza who was reinstated in his duchy in spite of his joining the league of Cognac. Pope Clemens VII instead, receiving the territory of Parma was to renounce his claims to Modena and Ferrara and to promise to arrange for a Concile in the next future to discuss about the Reform of the Church. Settled the political affairs in the peninsula, Charles was crowned by Pope Clement VII King of Italy on 22 February 1530 and Holy Roman Emperor two day later, in two solemn ceremonies arranged in Bologna. The imperial crown was a really big gift for his 30th birthday: Charles V resulted, in facts, the last Holy Roman Emperor in history to be personally crowned by the Pope.

Several Protestant electors objected to the Catholic emphasis of the Augsburg Interim and refused to abide by it. Charles attempted to force its acceptance, an action that led the Protestants to adopt the Leipzig Interim, which upheld Protestant doctrines, at a subsequent Diet. Neither interim was fully accepted so a German religious settlement was not brought about until the Peace of Augsburg (1555).

Only two denominations were recognized, the Roman Catholics and the Lutherans. Moreover, in each territory of the empire, only one denomination was to be recognized, the religion of the prince's choice being thus made obligatory for his subjects. Protestant and Catholic citizens in the free and imperial cities remained free to exercise their religion as they pleased. The wish for a lasting settlement was so strong that the compromise peace, which satisfied no one completely and had many loopholes, was accepted.

The Count of Nevers-Rethel, originally a sidebranch of the Cleves ducal dynasty, and the Elector of Saxony considered themselves legitimate heirs by virtue of several treaties, and the Emperor, desiring to expand the Habsburgs' supply base near the rebellious Netherlands, declared both female succession and the treaties invalid and was about to confiscate the United Duchies as a lapsed fief.

	#-#The first phase of the Thirty Years War saw the defeat of the rebellious protestant nobles of Bohemia who were punished severely and their lands expropriated because of their decision to depose Ferdinand of Austria in favor of the Protestant Palatine elector as Bohemian King. Consequently religious persecutions began in Bohemia to eradicate Protestantism from that land. To penalize Friedrich V of the Palatinate and to reward Maximilian of Bavaria, Ferdinand deprived Friedrich of his electorate and of the Upper Palatinate and granted both to Bavaria. That was an obvious violation of imperial law, but since no German prince was really in a position to defy Ferdinand and Maximilian, it was done and Maximilian had achieved a recognition proportionate to his power. An unsuccessful attempt to help the Lutheran rulers of neighboring Lower Saxony made by King Christian IV of Denmark who, himself a Lutheran and, as Duke of Holstein, an Imperial nobleman, feared that Denmark's sovereignty as a Protestant nation was being threatened. The Danish army was routed by the fiercer imperial troops under the command of Albrecht von Wallenstein, who was given by Emperor Ferdinand II free hand in pillaging all the territories his army would have crossed or captured from the enemy. The victories of the Catholic League against the German Protestant princes persuaded Ferdinand II to issue the Edict of Restitution with the intention to take back the Lutheran holdings that were, according to the Peace of Augsburg, rightfully the possession of the Catholic Church. So this brief document purported to do no more than enforce the terms of the Peace of Augsburg. However, the interpretation put on that document was that which had been urged by partisans of Catholicism. Thus it became the source of outrage for King Gustav II Adolphus of Sweden (the Lion of the North) who, like Christian IV before him, came to aid the German Lutherans to forestall Catholic aggression against their homeland and to obtain economic influence in the German states around the Baltic Sea which were threatened by the imperial authority.

But in 1635 the Emperor and the German princes stipulated a peace treaty in Prague, with which the Protestant rulers were allowed to retain secularized bishoprics held by them in 1627, the enforcement of the Edict of Restitution was delayed for 40 years, the armies of the Emperor and of the German states were reunited to one imperial army and the German princes were forbidden to have alliances between them or with foreign powers. Since this treaty acknowledged the authority of the Habsburg party in the Empire and subsequently it renewed the threat for France of being surrounded at her borders, Cardinal Richelieu decided it was the moment for France to enter a preventive war against Spain and Austria.

Some council members advocated using the opportunity the Habsburgs had at that time, due to their military control of the country, to subjugate the defiant Hungarians once and for all and introduce absolutistic rule in Hungary iure belli, by the law of war. The Emperor himself however decided to opt for a reconciliation with the Estates of Hungary that would secure the power of his dynasty in that Kingdom without abolishing its constitution which would almost certainly eventually provoke another large-scale uprising. Thus, at a Diet convoked in Buda he agreed to confirm Hungary's constitution with three amendments: the succession was made hereditary in the male line of the Habsburgs, the ius resistendi, the right of the Hungarian subjects to rebel against a monarch who violated the constitution, was abolished, and the promise of the Emperor to 'observe the country's laws and privileges' was modified by the clause 'as the King and the assembled Estates shall agree on the interpretation and application thereof'. The Habsburgs had thereby finally achieved recognition as hereditary Kings in all of Hungary.

But both nations were too powerful, and the addition of the Spanish empire would make any of them unstoppable, and so candidates not destined to their thrones, Philip of Anjou and Charles Habsburg, were discussed as heirs to Carlos, and several partition agreements were negotiated. That is precisely what everybody wanted to prevent in Spain. Despite the bigger influence from the Austracist party led by the mother of Carlos, there was an undisputable fact: France had 300,000 soldiers next to Spain and the Spanish Netherlands, and so represented the only opportunity, albeit small, to keep the empire together. A will was redacted and the agonizing Carlos signed it. It bequeathed the Kingdom to Philip Anjou, but it contained two crucial clauses, the condition that the crowns of France and Spain should never be held by the same person, and the condition that if any partition took place, then the crown of Spain should go to Charles Habsburg. Austria, of course, rejected it, starting the war in Italy, but the rest of Europe seemed to agree, as the equilibrium was not broken. But, could Louis XIV resist the temptation?\n \n Historically the Austrian Empire was quite successful despite losing the Spanish throne. The Spanish Netherlands became the Austrian Netherlands, Milan, the Kingdom of Naples, Sicily and Sardina were conquered. But historically only Milan and the Austrian Netherlands would stay in Austrian hands - the southern Italian possesions were either lost in the next war or traded away. Should we try only to achieve what was historically achieved - or should we try to be more successful than history?

But the allies were frustrated by their inability to impose the Archduke on the Spaniards, and surprised by their stern resistance, and went too far in their conditions demanding that Louis should remove his own grandson from the throne of Spain by force. This was a humiliation too big to endure, and Louis understood that he was negotiating from a position of weakness and decided to break the negotiations and renew the fight. Time would prove him right, as dissensions were already dividing the allies as the French threat receded. The Dutch and the Austrians were already at odds over the Spanish Netherlands, and the Austrians were seeing as not doing their part, occupied with the Hungarian revolt. The turning point was the unexpected death of Emperor Joseph I, at 33 years of age in April 1711.

Since Spain and Austria had not settled the issue and it was impossible to reach an agreement between all participants, it was decided that separate peace treaties between the parties would end the war. To Austria, the English decission was little less than treason, but Austrian participation in the war had been less than stellar, consumed as she was by her war against the Ottoman empire and the rebellions in Hungary. During the 1713 season, Austria tried to continue the campaign of the Rhine, but failed to achieve any significant result. The Spanish Netherlands had already been guaranteed for Austria by the treaty between France and the United Provinces, and the French were most than willing to sign a separate peace and surrender all the Spanish Italian possessions in their hands. Already in March 1713, Elizabeth Christine Brunswick, regent of Spain on behalf of Charles II of Habsburg, had left Barcelona, abandoning the Spanish Austracists and leaving Stahrenberg to reach an agreement with Felipe V. Finally Charles signed the peace with France at Radstatt (March 6, 1714) and Baden (September 7, 1714). Charles had won the Spanish Netherlands, Milan, Naples, Sardinia (later exchanged for Sicily to Savoy) and Mantua (whose Duke Ferdinando Carlo was declared deposed because of his siding with France in the war), and restored the right bank of the Rhine to the empire, but he had lost the throne of Spain. An agreement with Spain was impossible, and will lead to the Spanish invasion of Sardinia and Sicily in 1717-1718, and to the formation of the Quadruple Alliance that would impose the treaty of the Hague to Spain on February 17, 1720, sealing the peace between Austria and Spain. At the Peace of Utrecht, Felipe, as King of Spain, renounced his right to the crown of France, and Charles renounced the crown of Spain. During the war of Polish succession, Felipe will finally be able to recover Naples and Sicily from Austria.

All rights to Hungary except the Banat of Temesvar, Croatia and Slavonia were ceded to Austria, Podolia to Poland, Dalmatia and the Peloponnesus to Venice. Russia got Azov in a separate treaty signed in 1700. Except for Greece, none of these losses was ever recovered permanently. The disintegration of the Ottoman Empire had begun. However the power in the Balkans shifted even more in the favour of Austria in the following years when the struggle continued. Historically Austrias great leader Prince Eugene of Savoy won a battle at Peterwardein and with the treaty of Pessarowitz a large part of the Ottoman Balkans became Austrian. Too large a part to hold on to it, for historically most of it was lost again to the Ottomans in another war. Will we be prudent and lay claim only to what Austria historically was able to take and keep - or will we allow Prince Eugene to recklessly drive the Ottomans as far south as he can and risk to lose those areas later?

Maria Theresa realized, however, that no military reform would be effective without financial reform and in this area she (advised by the brilliant Friedrich Wilhelm, Count von Haugwitz) achieved her perhaps greatest accomplishments. Following the military and financial reforms other changes came, generally in administrative matters. Although these reforms were subjected to many modifications and changes throughout Maria Theresa's reign and after, the result was a government far more centralized than it had ever been before.

The peace that followed the conflict, provoked by the foreign opposition to the Pragmatic Sanction stated by the former Emperor Charles VI and ended with the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, resulted in a well defined rivalry between major European powers forming essentially two main political formations: the alliance of the socalled 'Bourbon family pact' (France, Spain, Naples and the latest Parma, all with members of the same House of Bourbons) with Prussia and the alliance between Austria, Russia and England. Disappointed by England's interested approaches to the emerging power of Prussia wich led to the Convention of Westminster, a treaty with which both countries would avoid any foreign military presence or access in the German territories, Austria strengthened her political ties with Saxony, Russia and Sweden and started new diplomatic handlings with France, traditionally an arch-enemy of the Habsburgs since the old dispute over the Burgundian inheritance but for sure the most powerful antagonist to the rising British colonial empire. And an alliance with France would also mean the support of Spain and the Bourbon Italian monarchies. That diplomatic move would lead to a huge world conflict fought in the years between 1756 and 1763: the socalled 'Seven Years War'.

In 1790, Nikolaus Esterházy died, but Haydn was retained by his son and was free to live in Vienna. In his last years his works show great diversity of style and seriousness of content yet retaining his vitality and fluency of utterance. At that time he composed his two great oratorios, 'The Creation' and 'The Seasons', clearly influenced by those of Haendel. Haydn died in 1809, after twice dictating his recollections and preparing a catalogue of his works.

On 20 march 1786 Joseph II decided to change the flag hoisted over all the Habsburgs dominions within the Holy Roman Empire with a more appropriate flag for Austria. However the use of red and white colours dates back to 1191 when, according to legend, duke Leopold got his white tunic entirely bloodstained by the end of a fierce battle fought at Ptolemais (Acre) except the part of the tunic protected by the wide belt which he found out still white, when taking his belt off. Losing his standard during the fray, Leopold supposedly raised his tunic as a rallying point, and that was when the design was subsequently made official. After this episode duke Leopold V would be supposedly granted these arms by King Henry VI.

In 1784 he informed the Hungarian government that it's official language, Latin, was really not effective for modern government and would be changed to German. To add to their horror, Joseph refused to submit to a coronation in Hungary lest he have to swear to uphold laws that he did not wish to, and then he had the sacred crown of the Kingdom moved to Vienna. In March 1787 Joseph swept away the constitution of the Austrian Netherlands and announced that from then on it would be ruled according to absolutist principles. Resistance simmered in the Austrian Netherlands until 1789 when it boiled over into open revolt. By that time there also were rumors of rebellion in Hungary and in Galicia, and for a time it appeared as if revolution might erupt in many parts of the monarchy.

	#-#Schubert showed an extraordinary childhood aptitude for music. By 1814 he had produced piano pieces, string quartets, a symphony and an opera. His huge output of 1814-15 includes numerous songs, besides two more symphonies, three masses and four stage works. From this time he enjoyed the companionship of several friends. Frequently gathering for evenings of Schubert's music, this group represented the new phenomenon of an educated, musically aware middle class. In 1818 more songs poured out, including 'Der Wanderer', and instrumental pieces: piano sonatas and the 5 and 6 Symphonies began to show increased harmonic subtlety. Schubert's fame was long limited to that of a songwriter, since the bulk of his large output was not even published until the late 19th century. Yet he produced major instrumental masterpieces. These are marked by an intense lyricism, a spontaneous chromatic modulation that is surprising yet clearly purposeful, and an imagination that creates its own formal structures.
