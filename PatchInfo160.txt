Changes-

-In 1474, If Ferrante I is King of Naples:
Choosing Queen Charlotte becomes choice C for Cyprus in the Two Queens event, Choice B allows the choice of Naples over Venice (the queen marries the Neapolitan heir).
If Naples chosen Cyprus is vassalized to Naples, relations change, they get a new monarch, and various events and monarchs are slept.
If Naples is chosen, in 1494 Cyprus gets an inheritance event to either accept Alfonso II of Naples as king or to go with a local. Just like the current situation with Venice
Also added some triggers for the Venetian inheritance of Cyprus (VEN exists, and the event vassalizing Cyprus to Venice happened.)
-BYZ should start out as vassal of OE.
The starting alliance for OE ought to have higher relations with each other. They will declare lots of wars and have wars declared on them, with the current starting relations (0,0 and 50) the alliance will rapidly fall apart and OE will ally with someone far off. Suggestion is to add +50.
Socotra is known to the Ottomans. It has been seen to become Chinese early on (then the capital gets known and a maptrade reveals *a lot*)and in any case it can be used as a base for rapid Ottoman expansion east. Should belong to whomever controls Dofar (Aden/Yemen right now) and be orthodox/arabic.
Give Egypt a starting alliance, to keep them away from the Ottoman alliance. I get back with a suggestion, some in N Africa or Hedjaz.
Give BYZ a peaceful AI, they should seldom declare wars.
-Weakened Genoa in the Black Sea and Georgia now as a two provincer.
-changed these:
Venetian Event for shipyard#17004
Ragusa terrain to mountains
Dalmatia terrain to mountains
remove from ID # 23007, action a , line 4
Manpower raised for Veneto (370) to 8
